Roger Belton was a passenger in that car.  When the officer spoke with the driver he smelled marijuana and saw an envelope he believed contained marijuana.  The officer also found that none of the car’s occupants owned the car or were related to the owner of the car.  After asking the four occupants of the car to get out, the officer searched the car and found a leather jacket belonging to Belton with cocaine zipped inside one of the pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial for criminal possession of a controlled substance, Belton argued that the officer seized the cocaine in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court denied his motion to suppress that evidence.  The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court held that the search was constitutional, reasoning that after the officer validly arrested Belton, he could reasonably search the immediate area for more contraband.  The Court of Appeals of New York reversed, holding that because Belton had no way of gaining access to the cocaine at the time the officer searched the car, the officer needed a warrant for the search he conducted.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay an officer lawfully search a car without a warrant after the occupants are separated from the vehicle and under arrest?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 6-3 vote, Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court rejected the previously used case-by-case analysis for whether a search is reasonable in favor of a bright line rule.  The Court held that a police officer can always lawfully search a car and any compartments in that car after arresting its occupants.  The search in this case was incident to a lawful arrest and did not violate the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a concurrence, stating that he joined in the opinion because the majority was unwilling to overturn \u003ci\u003eMapp v. Ohio\u003c/i\u003e, which held that evidence obtained in unlawful searches and seizures cannot be used in criminal prosecutions.  Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurrence, expressing that the “automobile exception” to the warrant requirement clearly gave the police officer authority to conduct the search in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan wrote a dissent, stating that the bright line rule adopted by the majority was a departure from prior precedent.  He argued that a clear rule will not provide officers in the field with any greater guidance about what searches are permissible.  Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in this dissent.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, expressing that the new rule permits officers to search luggage, briefcases, or other containers in a car without a warrant or any suspicion that they contain relevant evidence.  Justice Marshall also joined in this dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37769,"name":"Paul J.

The trial court dismissed the charge and held that Ohio violated the petitioners’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause by engaging in discriminatory prosecution. Ohio appealed to the Court of Appeals of Ohio for the Eighth District, which reversed the trial court’s decision and reinstated the charges. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio and argued that Ohio’s decision to prosecute Hustler, instead of other magazines that routinely published similar content, was discriminatory. The Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that petitioners did not establish the elements for a prima facie case for unconstitutional discriminatory prosecution. To do so, petitioners had to show that they were singled out for prosecution while there were other magazines similarly situated that were not prosecuted, and that the government’s decision to prosecute them was made in bad faith, based upon race, religion, or the desire to prevent their exercise of First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court of Ohio determined the petitioners had not met this burden and remanded the case to the lower courts so that the petitioners could present further evidence to meet this burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the Supreme Court assume jurisdiction over a case that has not received final judgment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court issued a per curium opinion for the 5-4 majority in which it dismissed the previously granted writ of certiorari for a lack of jurisdiction. The Court noted that it normally reviews decisions that have received final judgment and that the ruling of the Supreme Court of Ohio was not a final judgment since it returned the case to the lower court and allowed the petitioners to provide further evidence relating to their discriminatory prosecution claim. Although the Court can disregard the final judgment requirement in cases where the refusal to review a lower court’s decision “might seriously erode federal policy;” in this case, the Supreme Court of Ohio’s ruling did not threaten to erode federal policy to the extent that review was necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that a criminal trial of the petitioners under the obscenity statute would undermine their First Amendment rights. Justice Stewart argued that this violation of rights was sufficient to dispose of the final judgment requirement. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissenting opinion in which he argued that the interest in protecting magazine publishers from being prosecuted because their magazines’ content offends state officials is a significant First Amendment interest, sufficient to allow the Court to review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26991,"name":"Herald Price Fahringer","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/herald_price_fahringer","view_count":0,"last_name":"Fahringer","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"herald_price_fahringer"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11797"},{"advocate":{"ID":18106,"name":"Bruce A.

In the primary, voters expressed their choice among Presidential candidates for the Democratic Party\u0027s nomination. Although the Wisconsin Democratic Party (State Party) selected delegates at a caucus occurring after the primary, Wisconsin law required these delegates to allot their votes at the National Convention in accord with the amount of support each candidate received in the primary. The National Party prohibited the State Party delegates from participating in the 1980 National Convention because of non-Democrat influence in the state primary. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the National Party must admit the delegates since Wisconsin had a \"compelling interest\" to maintain the \"open\" feature of its primary system.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a state compel a National Party Convention to admit delegates from its state if those delegates were selected in a manner violating the National Party\u0027s rules?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Potter Stewart the Court reversed the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Wigoda\u003c/em\u003e, the Court held that the \"First Amendment freedom to gather in association for the purpose of advancing shared beliefs is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by any State.\" Granting states the power to place delegates in a National Convention over party objections to how they were selected would impair the right of political parties to associate with whom they wish, especially when non-party members could influence the interests of the delegates. Justice Lewis Powell argued in his dissent that Wisconsin\u0027s \"compelling interest\" to involve non-affiliated voters in the primary justified this burden on the freedom of association, although the majority held that this could be accomplished without intruding upon internal party rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39133,"name":"Ronald E.

Their trial gained much media attention. Local television stations televised a small portion of the trial, thanks to a recent Florida Supreme Court decision which permitted (with certain restrictions) electronic media to record judicial proceedings. Officers Chandler and Granger objected to the coverage and were found guilty as charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes allowing radio, television, and still photographic coverage of a criminal trial for public broadcast violate the accused\u0027s right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found no constitutional violation in this case. Chief Justice Burger first denied Chandler\u0027s and Granger\u0027s claim that the Court\u0027s holding in Estes v. Texas (1964) regarded television cameras in the courtroom as offensive to due process. State experimentation with \"evolving technology\" in the courtroom, as long as it does not infringe on \"fundamental guarantees\" of the accused, is consistent with the Constitution. Furthermore, Florida\u0027s policy was implemented with strict guidelines intended to protect the right of a defendant to a fair trial. For example, the state required its courts to protect certain witnesses from the \"glare of publicity\" and to hear and consider arguments from a defendant who feels that electronic coverage may bias the jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33124,"name":"Jim Smith","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jim_smith","view_count":0,"last_name":"Smith","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jim_smith"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellee","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11828"},{"advocate":{"ID":30965,"name":"Joel Hirschhorn","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/joel_hirschhorn","view_count":0,"last_name":"Hirschhorn","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"joel_hirschhorn"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11829"},{"advocate":{"ID":18905,"name":"Calvin L.

On December 26, 1978, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a proposal to change the federal standard regarding cotton dust exposure. There was a 90-day comment period followed by a series of hearings over the course of two weeks. After the hearings, the Secretary of Labor, Raymond J. Donovan, determined that exposure to cotton dust represented a significant health risk that warranted the adoption of the new standard. The new standard required a mix of engineering controls, such as the installation of pieces of equipment, along with work practice controls, and required these changes within four years. The petitioners, representing the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the validity of the standard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. They argued that the Act required OSHA to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the costs and benefits associated with the standard. The Court of Appeals held that OSHA had done everything required by the Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Occupational Safety and Health Act require OSHA to demonstrate that the reduction of risk is significant enough to offset the costs of adopting a new standard?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 5-3 majority. The Court held that that the language of the Act requires OSHA to engage in feasibility analysis but not a cost-benefit analysis. The legislative history of the Act indicates that Congress understood that new standards would create significant costs for employers but found the costs necessary to create safe working environments. The Court also held that OSHA reasonably evaluated the cost and feasibility of implementing the standards, and that the decision to implement was supported by substantial evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that OSHA did not have substantial evidence to justify its determination of the cost and therefore did not effectively show that the standard was economically feasible. In his separate dissent, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that the Act unconstitutionally delegated policy-making authority from the legislative branch of government to an unelected official in the executive branch. He argued that the legislative history of the Act shows that Congress could not decide exactly how much authority OSHA should have in enacting standards, so the feasibility requirement represented a Congressional compromise rather than a decision. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25102,"name":"George H.

Atlanta police responded to the residence and, without a warrant, searched the home of petitioner Gary Steagald. Although the police did not find Lyons, they did find what appeared to be cocaine. At this point, the police obtained a warrant and completed their search, in which they found 43 pounds of cocaine.\n\u003cp\u003eSteagald was arrested and brought to trial. He moved to suppress the evidence that police found prior to the warrants, and the district court denied the motion. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment prevent police officers from searching for a suspect in the home of a third party without obtaining a warrant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment prevents all warrantless searches of homes unless there are clearly exigent circumstances. Although the officers in this case did have a warrant to arrest Lyons, their warrant did not extend to the search of Steagald’s home, and there was no judicial oversight to determine if there were grounds for such an extension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist dissented and argued that, if the police possess a valid search warrant and believe the subject is in a third party’s residence, they can reasonably execute a search to carry out the arrest warrant. The arrest warrant can serve as a search warrant because it functions to limit the scope of the search. He also argued that the state has a compelling interest in a search because of the inherent mobility of the subject. Justice Byron R. White joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33711,"name":"John Richard Young","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/john_richard_young","view_count":0,"last_name":"Young","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"john_richard_young"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11858"},{"advocate":{"ID":15933,"name":"Mr. Andrew L.

Burdine possessed several years’ experience, was promoted and was often assigned additional duties. Burdine applied for the supervisor’s position of Project Director, however, she never received a response and the position remained vacant for six months. When the PSC learned it would lose funding unless it appointed a permanent Project Director and completely reorganized the PSC staff, a male employee from another division was hired as Project Director. Three employees, including Burdine, were let go, leaving a male as the only professional employee in the division. The TDCA rehired Burdine and assigned her to another division where she received the same salary as the Project Director at PSC. Burdine sued the TDCA and alleged that the failure to promote her and the decision to terminate her were gender discrimination that violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district held that neither decision was based on gender discrimination. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed in part because the TDCA bore the burden of proof and did not prove it was more likely than not that the male employee hired or promoted was better qualified than Burdine. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAfter an employee has proven a prima facie case of discrimination treatment, does the burden shift to the defendant to persuade the court of the nondiscriminatory reasons for the termination of the employee? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis P. Powell, Jr. delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court, which held that the defendant bears the burden of proof to clearly explain the nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions in a gender discrimination case and can do so by introducing the reasons for the plaintiff’s rejection. In this case, the TDCA was not required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Burdine and also was not required to prove by objective evidence that the person hired was more qualified than Burdine. The Court held that employers should have discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates, provided the decision is not based on unlawful criteria; therefore, the TDCA was not required to hire a minority or female applicant when that person’s objective qualifications were equal to those of a white male applicant. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27119,"name":"Hubert L.

Thomas, a Jehovah\u0027s Witness and an employee of Blaw-Knox Foundry \u0026amp; Machinery Co., asked his company to lay him off when it transferred all of its operations to weapons manufacturing. He stated that his religious faith prohibited him from producing arms. His employer refused, so he quit instead. He applied for unemployment compensation benefits under the Indiana Employment Security Act, which the Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division denied. The board agreed that he quit because of his religious convictions, but claimed that this was not a \"good cause [arising] in connection with [his] work\" that would qualify him for benefits. The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed the decision on the ground that it burdened Thomas\u0027 First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion. The Supreme Court of Indiana reinstated the board\u0027s initial decision, calling Thomas\u0027 decision to quit a \"personal philosophical choice\" that only indirectly burdened his free exercise right.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Free Exercise Clause require a state to provide unemployment compensation benefits to an employee who quit because of a belief that his religion prohibited him from engaging in the employer\u0027s line of work?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 decision authored by Justice Burger, the Court held that the Review Board\u0027s denial of unemployment benefits to Thomas violated his First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court of Indiana wrongfully used Thomas\u0027 struggle to \"articulate\" his religious beliefs as grounds to call his decision merely \"philosophical.\" The Court\u0027s decisions in _ Everson v. Board of Education_ and \u003cem\u003eSherbert v. Verner\u003c/em\u003e had established that \"[a] person may not be compelled to choose between the exercise of a First Amendment right and participation in an otherwise available public program.\" In his dissent, Justice Rehnquist argued that the free exercise clause did not require a \"State to provide direct financial assistance to persons solely on the basis of their religious beliefs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18100,"name":"Blanca Bianchi de la Torre","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre","view_count":0,"last_name":"De La Torre","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11871"},{"advocate":{"ID":44472,"name":"William E.

Without her counsel\u0027s knowledge two agents of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) conversed with her regarding a related investigation. During this conversation the agents advised that she have a public defender represent her instead of her private counsel. They also told her that the severity of her punishment would depend on how well she cooperated with them. Morrison notified her counselor immediately and did not speak to the agents about the investigation. She unsuccessfully petitioned the District Court to dismiss her indictment on the ground that the agents had violated her Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Morrison then entered a guilty plea to one count of the indictment. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found that Morrison\u0027s Sixth Amendment rights had been violated and ruled to drop all charges against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit wrongfully dismiss criminal charges on the ground that the defendant\u0027s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated in a way that had no tangible effect upon court proceedings?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron White authored the opinion for the Court unanimously reversing the Third Circuit\u0027s decision. For sake of argument, the Court granted that Morrison\u0027s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated, but held that this did not merit the dismissal of all charges since the conduct of the agents did not prejudice the outcome of the trial. The Court maintained that Sixth Amendment violations should not be remedied beyond the scope of the harm they inflicted upon the defendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37735,"name":"Peter Buscemi","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/peter_buscemi","view_count":0,"last_name":"Buscemi","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"peter_buscemi"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11880"},{"advocate":{"ID":41177,"name":"Salvatore J.

Lassiter was born out of wedlock. On May 23, 1975, the state determined that William L. Lassiter was a neglected child in need of protection, and placed him in the custody of the Durham County Department of Social Services. The state then placed William in foster care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby Gail Lassiter, William’s mother, was convicted of second-degree murder in July of 1976, and began serving her twenty-five to forty year sentence at the North Carolina Correctional Center for Women. In 1978, the Department petitioned the court to terminate Abby’s parental rights. It alleged that Abby had not contacted William since December 1975, and that she willfully left William in foster care. On August 31, 1978, the state brought Abby from prison to the hearing, which opened with a discussion of whether Abby should have more time to find legal assistance. The court concluded that she had ample opportunity to obtain counsel; Abby did not claim to be indigent, and the court did not appoint counsel for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA social worker from the Department testified about Abby’s lack of contact with William, Abby’s mother’s unfitness to care for William, and William’s condition. Abby cross-examined the social worker, but many of her questions were disallowed because they were arguments. She also testified on her own behalf and later cross-examined her mother, who denied saying she could not care for William, contradicting the Department’s allegation. The court held that Abby willfully failed to maintain concern or responsibility for William’s welfare, and terminated Abby’s status as William’s parent. On appeal, the North Carolina Court of Appeals determined that North Carolina was not constitutionally mandated to provide Abby counsel during the hearing. The Supreme Court of North Carolina denied her application for discretionary review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require North Carolina to provide Abby Gail Lassiter with counsel in a proceeding to permanently and irrevocably terminate her parental rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court held that North Carolina was not constitutionally required to appoint counsel for Lassiter. Justice Stewart emphasized that due process required fundamental fairness. He wrote, however, that the Court generally only recognized an indigent’s right to appointed counsel where the litigant could lose his physical liberty if he lost the litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart looked to the Court’s due process standard in \u003cem\u003eMathews v. Eldridge\u003c/em\u003e, determining that 1) Lassiter’s interest was important, 2) the state shared with Lassiter a common interest in a correct decision, but also a pecuniary interest and an interest in informal procedures, and 3) the complexity of some proceedings could be great enough to make the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a parent’s rights insupportably high. He refused to hold, however, that indigent parents were entitled to counsel in proceedings to terminate parental rights. He acknowledged that thirty-three states and the District of Columbia required counsel in termination hearings, but characterized this as wise public policy and not a constitutional requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren Burger concurred, implying that the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted because the termination proceeding was not punitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry Blackmun dissented, joined by Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall. He argued that the unique importance of a parent’s interest in the care and custody of his or her child could not be constitutionally extinguished through formal judicial proceedings without the benefit of counsel. Justice Blackmun disagreed that physical confinement was the only loss of liberty serious enough to trigger a right to appointed counsel under the Due Process Clause.

Writing for the majority in a 7-1 decision, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. maintained that Minnesota\u0027s statute was not unconstitutional, acknowledging that the legislature had an interest in promoting resource conservation and resolving solid waste disposal issues. The difference between non-reusable plastic containers and paper or reusable plastic containers was \"rationally related\" to the legislature\u0027s purpose, and therefore not unconstitutional under the rational basis test set forth in \u003cem\u003eNew Orleans v. Dukes\u003c/em\u003e. The statute banned sale of all milk in the specified containers and did not distinguish by seller, and therefore did not violate the commerce clause.

Congress agreed with Carter\u0027s decision, but did not enact his recommendation that the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) be amended to include the registration of females. A number of men challenged the constitutionality of the MSSA, and the challenge was sustained by a district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the MSSA\u0027s gender distinctions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that Congress\u0027s decision to exempt women from registration \"was not the \u0027accidental by-product of a traditional way of thinking about females\u0027\" and did not violate the Due Process Clause. The Court found that men and women, because of combat restrictions on women, were not \"similarly situated\" for the purposes of draft registration. The Court also upheld Congress\u0027s judgment that the administrative and military problems that would be created by drafting women for noncombat roles were sufficient to justify the Military Selective Service Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11923"},{"advocate":{"ID":21676,"name":"Donald L.

On October 10, 1974, George Summers was leaving his house in Detroit, Michigan, as local police officers arrived with a warrant to search the property for narcotics. The officers requested that Summers help them gain entry to the house, and they detained him while they searched the premises. After finding two packages of heroin in the basement, the officers arrested Summers and searched his person. In his coat pocket, they found an envelope containing heroin, and it was this discovery of heroin⎯not the heroin found in the basement⎯that formed the basis of charges against Summers. At trial, Summers argued that the search of his person was illegal because the officers had no authority to detain him during their search of the house. The trial judge agreed and granted Summers’ motion to suppress the heroin evidence. On appeal, the State argued that Summers’ detention was reasonable, given his close proximity to the house when the officers arrived to perform the search. The State also contended that the concealable nature of the narcotics described in the warrant implicitly authorized the search of people found on the property. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s order. The State appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, which affirmed the ruling of the lower court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the officers have the authority under the Fourth Amendment to detain Summers while they executed a warrant to search his house for heroin and other contraband?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that a warrant to search for contraband grants police officers the limited authority to detain occupants of a house during the search of the premises. This authority is an exception to the probable cause standard to determine the reasonableness of Fourth Amendment seizures. The law enforcement interests in preventing the flight of occupants of the property named in the search warrant, reducing the risk of harm to officers, and otherwise facilitating the search convinced the Court that the detention of people on the property in question was reasonable. Similarly, the Court held that the exception to the probable cause standard applied to Summers’ detention because it was less intrusive than an arrest and unlikely to be abused by police officers. Finally, the connection between an occupant and the home named in the search warrant gave the officers an easily identifiable and certain basis on which to detain Summers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissenting opinion in which he criticized the Court for expanding the scope of the exception to the probable cause standard for Fourth Amendment seizures. Justice Stewart argued that the State failed to offer a justification for the detention that was unrelated to its interest in investigating crimes and apprehending suspects. He further expressed concern that the Court’s holding could be exploited by police officers eager to detain occupants and make them available for arrest in case the search of the property revealed evidence of criminal activity. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17601,"name":"Bruce J.

When Secretary of State Alexander Haig revoked Agee\u0027s passport, Agee filed suit claiming that Haig did not have congressional authorization to do so.

The press contained a temperature probe which measured the temperature rise of the rubber from within the press. By repeatedly calculating the rubber cure time from this temperature measurement and comparing this computed cure time to the actual elapsed time, the computer was able to determine precisely when to open the press and eject the cured rubber, which then emerged perfectly cured. The patent examiner, viewing all computer programs as unpatentable because of the earlier Supreme Court decision Gottschalk v. Benson (1972), rejected their patent application because, he argued, the inventors had simply combined an unpatentable program with a conventional rubber curing press. An appellate court reversed the Examiner and ordered a patent to issue. The Commissioner of Patents then petitioned successfully to have the Supreme Court review this decision. Before the Supreme Court, the inventors\u0027 attorney argued that the steps of continuously measuring temperature and repeatedly recalculating the rubber cure time and comparing it to the elapsed time were new steps that were worthy of patent protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan one patent a machine that transforms materials physically under the control of a programmed computer?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 decision, the court held that a machine which transforms materials physically under the control of a programmed computer is patentable. In addition, and without overruling the earlier Gottschalk v. Benson decision holding that a mathematical procedure cannot be patented, the majority in Diehr said the Benson decision did not render all computer programs unpatentable, contrary to what Justice John Paul Stevens argued in his strong dissenting opinion in Diehr. The Diehr court left undecided the question of whether computer programs standing by themselves could ever be patentable. Immediately following the Diehr ruling, software patent applications began flowing into the Patent Office in a steady stream that remains undiminished today. (Thirteen years later, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in In re Alappat, ruled that virtually all computer programs are patentable.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40769,"name":"Robert E.

Under the old system, employees who were eligible for both railroad benefits and social security benefits received both, along with an additional “windfall” benefit. Since this system threatened to bankrupt the railroad retirement program, the goal of the new Act was to eliminate some of these benefits. The new Act divided employees into different classes based on their employment history as of January 1, 1975. Employees who had worked for the railroad fewer than 10 years would not receive any windfall benefit. Employees who were already retired and receiving the full benefits would continue to do so. Employees who qualified for the full benefits but had not yet retired would receive the full benefits only if they had a current connection to the railroad industry or had served for 25 years or more. Employees who did not meet these requirements received a lesser windfall benefit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appellee Gerhard H. Fritz was part of a plaintiff class of former railroad employees who were eligible for the windfall benefits under the old system, but who did not have a current connection to the railroad and had worked fewer than 25 years. Alleging that the Act created an irrational distinction between employees that violated the Due Process Clause, they filed a class action suit in district court. The district court held that such a distinction was not “rationally related” to the goal of ensuring the solvency of the retirement system.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by creating irrational distinctions between employees?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that laws may create classifications that are not elegant or “artfully drawn” but that are not unconstitutional. The Constitution would allow Congress to deny windfall benefits to all employees, therefore it was not unconstitutional to deny them to some. The Court also held that the distinctions were not arbitrary, as Congress was attempting to “protect the relative equities of employees and to provide benefits to career railroad employees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that the statute deserved more consideration to determine whether the adverse impact was a deliberate aim or an acceptable cost of the legislation. Since the Act had two conflicting aims — to protect the solvency of the retirement program and to ensure that employees received the benefits they earned — he argued that the statute in question legitimately pursues those goals. Congress had to make cuts in order to ensure the solvency, and length of service was a fair method of drawing distinctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent where he argued that a “principal purpose” of the Act was to ensure that the employees received the benefits that they earned. Since this statute directly conflicts with the stated goal, the classification cannot be rationally based on the legislation. He also disagreed with the Court’s analysis that did not consider the effect of the statute in relation to its purpose. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20537,"name":"Daniel P.

Only \"onsite\" billboards with a message relating to the property they stood on would be permitted. Upon petition by a coalition of businesses owning advertising signs, a trial court ruled that the ban was an unconstitutional exercise of the city\u0027s police powers and hindered First Amendment rights of the businesses. The California Court of Appeals affirmed that the city had exceeded its police powers, but the California Supreme Court reversed this judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a city ban on \"offsite\" outdoor advertising signs violate First and Fourteenth Amendment provisions for free speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron White wrote the opinion for a 6-3 court. The ban\u0027s exception allowing \"onsite\" advertising discriminated against noncommercial speech. It allowed businesses in commercial properties to interrupt city motorists so long as it was with their own messages yet barred noncommercial advertisers from causing the same level of interruption. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented and viewed the \"onsite\" exception to the ban as \"essentially negligible\" rather than unconstitutional favoritism. However the Court held that affording \"a greater degree of protection to commercial than to noncommercial speech\" reversed the long-standing Court precedent to show greater deference to noncommercial speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23503,"name":"Floyd Abrams","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/floyd_abrams","view_count":0,"last_name":"Abrams","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"floyd_abrams"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12015"},{"advocate":{"ID":20018,"name":"C.

Upon smelling marijuana smoke as they approached the car, officers searched the passenger compartment, where they found marijuana. The officers then opened a recessed luggage compartment in the trunk and unwrapped two tightly sealed packages that each contained a pound of marijuana. Robbins was charged with several drug offenses. At trial, he argued that the evidence of the drugs was the product of an illegal search and filed a motion to suppress the evidence. The judge denied the motion, and a jury convicted Robbins. Robbins appealed, but the California Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case for the appellate court to consider in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Arkansas v. Sanders\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;, which established that officers could not search closed luggage found during a lawful automobile search. The California Court of Appeal affirmed Robbins conviction a second time on that grounds that Robbins did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because the package’s contents could be inferred given the shape, size, and wrapping of the exterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay police officers search closed containers found during a lawful, warrantless search of an automobile?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 6-3 plurality. The plurality opinion held that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement under the Fourth Amendment did not extend to closed and opaque containers found during the search. According to the plurality of the Court, the record in the case did not support the appellate court’s finding that Robbins did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred in the judgment of the Court. In an opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote that the careful manner in which the packages containing the marijuana were wrapped and sealed demonstrated Robbins’s intention to keep their contents private. However, he argued that the plurality opinion imposed too heavy a burden on police officers by requiring them to obtain a warrant to search every closed container found during a lawful, warrantless search of an automobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a dissent in which he argued that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement should authorize police officers to seize and search any personal containers found within the vehicle. Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a separate dissent in which he agreed with Justice Blackmun’s proposed rule. He also expressed opposition to the practice of excluding evidence obtained through impermissible means, especially with the Court’s extension of exclusionary rule to state law enforcement agencies in Mapp v. Ohio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe argued that the harshness of the rule created an unfair advantage for the suspects because it required police officers to not only understand the nuanced case law surrounding the Fourth Amendment, but also to make the correct decision instantly. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissent in which he argued that the scope a lawful, warrantless search should include any container that a magistrate could authorize by warrant. As the police officers searched the car for evidence of contraband, the fact that the packages were tightly wrapped and sealed was of little consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36133,"name":"Marshall Warren Krause","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/marshall_w_krause","view_count":0,"last_name":"Krause","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"marshall_w_krause"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12019"},{"advocate":{"ID":40076,"name":"Ronald E.

Minnesota State Fair Rule 6.05 required organizations wishing to sell or distribute goods and written material to do so from an assigned location on the fairgrounds. In other words, walking vendors and solicitors were not allowed. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness challenged the rule, arguing that it restricted the ability of its followers to freely exercise their religious beliefs at the state fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a state, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, confine religious organizations wishing to sell and distribute religious literature at a state fair to an assigned location within the fairgrounds?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eUsing the \"valid time, manner, and place\" criteria which the Court employs to assess government restrictions of First Amendment activities, the Court held that Rule 6.05 did not violate the Constitution. Since the rule was applied equally to all groups wanting to solicit at the fairgrounds, not making restrictions based on the content of a group\u0027s message, and because the state had an important interest in \"protecting the safety and convenience\" of the fair\u0027s patrons, Justice White argued that the rule\u0027s restrictions were legitimate. Allowing all religious, nonreligious, and commercial groups to move about the grounds distributing literature and soliciting funds would result in \"widespread disorder\" which would be potentially dangerous to the fair\u0027s visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35187,"name":"Laurence H.

Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (CBS) refused to make the requested time available, emphasizing in part the potential disruption of regular programming. CBS offered to sell the CMPC two five-minute segments instead. The American Broadcasting Companies (ABC) and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) each replied that it had not yet begun to sell political time for the 1980 presidential campaign. On October 29, 1979, the CMPC filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), charging that the networks violated their obligations under the Federal Communications Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Federal Communications Act of 1934, as modified by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, authorized the FCC to revoke broadcasting station licenses for willful or repeated failure to allow reasonable access or failure to permit the purchase of reasonable amounts of time for the use of a broadcasting station by a legally qualified candidate for federal elective office. On November 26, 1979, the FCC ruled in a four-to-three vote that the networks violated the act, rejecting the networks’ arguments that Congress did not intend the act to create a new right of access to the broadcast media and that the FCC improperly substituted its judgment for the networks’ in evaluating the CMPC’s request for time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the seizure of American embassy personnel in Iran in November 1979, the CMPC decided to postpone the broadcast of its thirty-minute program; it successfully purchased five minutes of time from CBS, and later purchased thirty minutes of time for the full program from ABC and NBC. Throughout these negotiations, however, all parties maintained their rights relating to the appeal to the FCC’s decision. The United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, affirmed the FCC’s decision. It held that the act created a new, affirmative right of access to broadcast media for candidates for federal office and that the FCC had the authority to evaluate whether a campaign has begun for purposes of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did the Federal Communications Act create a new, individual right of broadcast access for the Carter-Mondale Presidential Committee, as the representatives of a candidate for federal office?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the act authorize the Federal Communications Commission to determine the beginning of the 1980 presidential campaign for purposes of the act and to assess the specific broadcast needs of the CMPC?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Did CBS have the right to decline to sell thirty minutes of broadcast time to the CMPC under the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, and no. In a 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Court held that the Federal Communications Act created a new, individual right to broadcast access for candidates for federal office. He looked to the language of the Federal Communications Act’s requirement that a broadcaster provide candidates with reasonable access to the airwaves. Justice Burger noted that this section focused on an individual candidate seeking airtime for his/her candidacy, and that a different section of the act already imposed a general, public interest duty on broadcasters to provide time for political programming. Justice Burger looked to the legislative history of the act and the FCC’s past interpretations of the public interest right of access; both indicated that the right of access for federal candidates was a new, separate right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to the FCC’s decision on the CMPC’s right of access to the airwaves, Chief Justice Burger held that the act authorized the FCC to determine whether a campaign has begun and to assess the specific needs of a candidate. He argued that the FCC did not arbitrarily set the starting date for a campaign; instead, it looked to objective evidence, taking into account the interests of candidates and the networks. Looking to the circumstances of the 1980 presidential election, Chief Justice Burger determined that the FCC did not abuse its discretion in holding that the networks failed to specifically grant the CMPC reasonable access to the airwaves. He noted that when the CMPC made its original request, ten candidates were formally seeking the Republican nomination and that various states had already started the delegate selection process, among other factors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Chief Justice Burger held that the First Amendment did not give CBS, Inc. the right to refuse to sell the CMPC thirty minutes of airtime. He argued that Congress intended for the act to protect the First Amendment rights of candidates and voters by securing a forum for candidates’ political speech. Justice Burger emphasized that while the act did not grant the CMPC a general constitutional right of access to broadcast media, the act created a limited right of reasonable access to broadcast media for candidates for federal office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White dissented, joined by Justices William Rehnquist and John Paul Stevens. Justice White looked to the history of federal regulation of broadcast media, inferring a clearly-defined legislative desire to preserve values of private journalism. He then turned to the legislative history of the act and determined that Congress merely codified the networks’ pre-existing duty to provide access to political broadcasts, attaching the threat of license revocation to give weight to that duty. He argued that the FCC arbitrarily determined that the start of a campaign was the beginning of the networks’ obligations under the act, and that the language of the act itself did not support FCC’s individualized-need approach. Further, this approach essentially destroyed the networks’ editorial discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens also filed a separate dissent. He argued that the FCC could not adequately evaluate the performance of the networks’ public interest duty by focusing on the needs or requests of particular candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42002,"name":"Stephen M.

He was arrested based on the identification of two witnesses. One of those witnesses identified Watkins as the gunman two days later in a lineup, and later that same day, the police took Watkins to the other witness’s hospital bed where he identified Watkins as the shooter. At the trial, both witnesses identified Watkins as the shooter. Watkins, along with two other witnesses, testified he was at a pool hall at the time of the shooting. Watkins was convicted, and on appeal he argued that the trial court had a constitutional obligation to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the identification evidence was admissible, but the Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected the argument. Watkins then sought a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied the writ and held that a failure to hold a pretrial hearing does not require the reversal of a conviction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a state criminal trial court constitutionally compelled to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury whenever a defendant contends that a witness’ identification was improper? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require a state criminal court to conduct a hearing out of the jury’s presence whenever a defendant contends that a witness’ identification was improper. The reliability of the identification evidence determines its admissibility, which can be evaluated under the trial judge’s jury instructions and the Due Process Clause is satisfied when the defendant is given the opportunity to cross-examine the witness to test the reliability of the identification. The Court held that while it is advisable for there to be a judicial determination of admissibility of identification evidence, it is not required. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24092,"name":"Frank W.
