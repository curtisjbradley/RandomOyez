According to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Act), every application for the interception of wire or oral communications had to be authorized by the Attorney General or by an Assistant Attorney General specifically designated by the Attorney General. The application in this case apparently contained all of the proper authorizations and signatures, was approved, and was used to arrest and charge Dominic Giordano with a drug crime. At Giordano’s pre-trial hearing, it came to light that the Assistant Attorney General had allowed an Executive Assistant in his office to authorize this and other applications. The district court granted Giordano’s motion to suppress the government’s evidence because it had misidentified the approving officer. The government appealed and argued that the court should not have suppressed the evidence because the Assistant Attorney General’s delegation to the Executive Assistant was not inconsistent with the Act and because the government’s conduct did not violate the Constitution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision and held that the Executive Assistant’s approval violated the Act, which required the suppression of the evidence in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Attorney General or a designated Assistant Attorney General allowed to delegate the power to authorize wiretap applications to an Executive Assistant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that Congress intended only the Attorney General or a specifically designated Assistant Attorney General to have the power to authorize wiretap applications. Consequently, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act required the Court to suppress any evidence obtained from a wiretap that was issued in response to an application with insufficient authorization. Additionally, because the original wiretap application was invalid, the government could not rely on any contested evidence obtained from the properly authorized extension of the original wiretap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he maintained that the Court should not have suppressed the evidence obtained from the extension of the original wiretap orders. Justice Powell argued that the probable cause for the properly authorized extensions was only partially obtained form the illegal wiretap; therefore, the Court did not need to suppress the evidence gathered from the extensions. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28072,"name":"H.

The special prosecutor appointed by Nixon and the defendants sought audio tapes of conversations recorded by Nixon in the Oval Office. Nixon asserted that he was immune from the subpoena claiming \"executive privilege,\" which is the right to withhold information from other government branches to preserve confidential communications within the executive branch or to secure the national interest. Decided together with Nixon v.

The Court granted that there was a limited executive privilege in areas of military or diplomatic affairs, but gave preference to \"the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of justice.\" Therefore, the president must obey the subpoena and produce the tapes and documents.

After reviewing the case and concluding the system was segregated, a district court ordered the adoption of a desegregation plan that encompassed eighty-five outlying school districts. The lower court found that Detroit-only plans were inadequate. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the metropolitan plan. This case was decided together with Allen Park Public Schools v. Bradley and Grosse Pointe Public School System v.

Board of Education. The Court noted that desegregation, \"in the sense of dismantling a dual school system,\" did not require \"any particular racial balance in each \u0027school, grade or classroom.\u0027\" The Court also emphasized the importance of local control over the operation of schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38778,"name":"Robert H.

Police did not ask Matlock which room he occupied in the house or whether they could conduct a search.  A woman, who gave them permission to search the house, including the bedroom where Matlock lived, let the officers inside.  The woman’s parents leased the house and Matlock paid them rent for his room. In that room, police found $4,995 in cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Matlock moved to suppress evidence obtained during the search.  He argued that the unwarranted search of his room was illegal.  At the suppression hearing, the woman who agreed to the search testified that she lived with Matlock in his room.  This gave her sufficient authority to lawfully consent to the search.  The district court held that those statements were inadmissible hearsay and granted the motion to suppress.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does a third party with control over a space have authority to consent to a search?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Were the woman’s statements that she lived with Matlock inadmissible hearsay?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that police can obtain consent for a search from a third party if that third party has common authority over the premises.  The woman’s statements should not have been excluded at the suppression hearing because evidentiary burdens are lower for suppression hearings than the actual trial.  On remand, the court must determine whether the woman had authority to consent to the search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented, arguing that the search was invalid because police officers failed to obtain a warrant when they had multiple opportunities to do so.  The woman letting police officers into the house violated Matlock’s and her parents\u0027 privacy.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a separate dissent, writing that, on remand, the court should determine whether the woman knew she did not have to consent to the search of the house.  Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35240,"name":"Lawrence G.

The Indiana State Election Board rejected its application to do so until the officers of the party had filed an affidavit stating that the party did not advocate the overthrow of local, state, or national government by force or violence. The Communist Party of Indiana sued State Election Board and its members and sought an injunction that would require the Board to place the candidates on the ballot. The district court found the policy constitutional and required the Communist Party of Indiana to submit an affidavit to that effect. The Board found the Party’s affidavit unsatisfactory and again rejected it. The Party sought an injunction requiring the Board to accept the affidavit, and the district court denied the motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Indiana’s policy requiring any new political party to file a loyalty oath signed by its officers violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that states may not interfere with the right to associate with the political party of one’s choice without proof that the political party was inciting immediate lawless action. Such action on the parts of the states prevented the effective casting of ballots, which violated basic civil and political rights, and was not in the best interests of the states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion concurring in judgment, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote that the facts of the case showed that Indian did not require affidavits from the two main political parties. Because the policy represented a discriminatory preference without any justification, it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the opinion concurring in judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41969,"name":"Sanford Jay Rosen","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sanford_jay_rosen","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rosen","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"sanford_jay_rosen"},"advocate_description":"for appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9292"},{"advocate":{"ID":43343,"name":"Theodore L.

The suit also objected to the prison\u0027s inspection of privileged mail between inmates and their attorneys. The district court rejected the disciplinary proceeding claims, but held that the inspection of mail violated the prisoners\u0027 right of access to the courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed on the disciplinary proceeding claims, holding that prisons should use the procedures used in probation and parole hearings for disciplinary proceeding. The court also affirmed the district court as to the inspection of mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the disciplinary proceedings at Nebraska Penal and Correctional Center violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 vote Justice Byron R. White wrote for the majority reversing in part and affirming in part. The Supreme Court held that while prisoners are not entitled to full due process protections, disciplinary proceedings must include written notice to the defendant of the charges, a written statement of evidence, and the opportunity for an inmate to call witnesses and present evidence. The Court allowed for discretion by officials to deny a prisoner the right to present evidence or call witnesses if it would be \"unduly hazardous to institutional safety.\" The Court also held that prison official\u0027s opening of privileged letters in the presence of other inmates was not unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented in part, stating that the inmate\u0027s right to present evidence and call witnesses is constitutionally protected and should not be abridged. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. joined. Justice Douglass wrote a dissent, saying that prisoners are entitled to all due process protections when they are faced with an substantial deprivation of liberty in the prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36147,"name":"Melvin Kent Kammerlohr","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/melvin_kent_kammerlohr","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kammerlohr","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"melvin_kent_kammerlohr"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9298"},{"advocate":{"ID":38778,"name":"Robert H.

She was ineligible for benefits from California\u0027s Disability Fund under Section 2626 of California\u0027s Unemployment Insurance Code. Section 2626 denied benefits to women whose disabilities resulted from pregnancy. Aiello and other disabled women who were denied benefits under Section 2626 challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California held the statute unconstitutional. The state appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Section 2626 of California\u0027s Unemployment Insurance Code violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 decision, the Court reversed the District Court and upheld the statute. In an opinion authored by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court accepted California\u0027s interest in keeping the Disability Fund program solvent and maintaining the low contribution rate from program members. Insuring disability resulting from pregnancy complications would be \"extraordinarily expensive\" and make the program \"impossible to maintain.\" As in \u003cem\u003eDandridge v. Williams\u003c/em\u003e, California was not obligated by the Equal Protection Clause to \"choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.\" Therefore, California could constitutionally choose which disabilities to insure through the Disability Fund in order to maintain the solvency and contribution level of the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29509,"name":"Joanne Condas","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/joanne_condas","view_count":0,"last_name":"Condas","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"joanne_condas"},"advocate_description":"Deputy Attorney General of California, argued the cause for appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9303"},{"advocate":{"ID":46465,"name":"Wendy W.

Calandra in connection with loan sharking activities.  The questions were based on evidence obtained during a search of Calandra’s business, Royal Machine and Tool Company.  Calandra refused to answer any questions, arguing that the search of Royal Machine unlawfully violated the Fourth Amendment.  The government attempted to grant Calandra immunity in district court, but he asked the court to suppress evidence obtained during the search.  The district court granted the suppression order and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule applied.  Under the exclusionary rule, any evidence obtained during an unlawful search and seizure cannot be used against the victim of that search in a criminal proceeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a witness refuse to answer questions before a grand jury when the questions are based on evidence obtained during a search that the witness feels is unlawful?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Lewis F. Powell, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed the lower court. The Supreme Court held that the exclusionary rule does not apply in grand jury proceedings. The purpose of a grand jury is to determine whether a crime was committed and whether to charge someone in connection with that crime.  Using the exclusionary rule would interfere with that purpose. The exclusionary rule is also meant to deter police misconduct, not provide a new constitutional right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan dissented, writing that application of the exclusionary rule should not depend on whether it deters police misconduct. The exclusionary rule gives meaning to the Fourth Amendments protection against unlawful search and seizure. Justice William O. Douglas and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34216,"name":"Louis F.

She was forced to discontinue her duties on March 12, 1971 because the Cleveland School Board required every teacher to take maternity leave without pay five months before the expected date of birth. The board also ruled that a teacher could not return from maternity leave until 1) the next school semester began, 2) the teacher obtained a certificate from her physician showing good medical health, and 3) the newborn child was three months old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn Elizabeth Nelson was a French teacher at Central Junior High School, also in Cleveland. She reported her pregnancy to the school\u0027s principal on January 29, 1971, and applied for maternity leave. Both LaFleur and Nelson wanted to continue teaching until the end of the school year, but were forced to leave in March 1971. LaFleur and Nelson filed separate suits in district court challenging the constitutionality of the school boards\u0027 maternity leave rules; the court tried their cases together, and held that the board\u0027s policies were constitutional. A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, reversed, concluding that the mandatory leave policy violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s equal protection clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Cohen was a social studies teacher at Midlothian High School in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Cohen notified the Chesterfield School Board that she was pregnant on November 2, 1970. The board\u0027s rule required pregnant teachers to go on maternity leave at the end of their fifth month, but allowed re-employment the next school year upon submission of a medical certificate from the teacher\u0027s physician. Cohen\u0027s obstetrician believed that she was fit to continue working, but the school board denied Cohen\u0027s request for an extension. Cohen challenged the constitutionality of Chesterfield County\u0027s rule in district court, which held that the regulation violated the equal protection clause. The United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, affirmed, but on rehearing en banc, the court upheld the constitutionality of the regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did both school boards\u0027 policies terminating teachers\u0027 employment in their fourth or fifth month of pregnancy violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the Cleveland School Board\u0027s policy preventing LaFleur and Nelson from returning to work until their children were three months old violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Did the Chesterfield School Board\u0027s policy allowing Cohen to resume employment after maternity leave only upon submission of a certificate of medical health by her physician violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes and no. Writing for a 7-2 majority, Justice Potter Stewart held that the school boards\u0027 regulations requiring pregnant teachers to stop working after the fifth month of their pregnancies violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s due process clause. Justice Stewart emphasized that the Court extends strong protection to individuals\u0027 freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life. He pointed to both boards\u0027 requirements that pregnant teachers provide advance notice of their condition, arguing that this was in itself sufficient to preserve continuity in classroom instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart then turned to the school boards\u0027 claim that the rules were required because some pregnant teachers became physically incapable of teaching. He reasoned that these rules amounted to an irrebuttable presumption that every teacher in her fourth or fifth month of pregnancy was incapable of teaching. He also rejected the boards\u0027 argument that the rules were necessary for administrative convenience, concluding that administrative efficiency was not a sufficiently important interest to validate what was otherwise a violation of due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart also held that the Cleveland School Board\u0027s eligibility restriction based on the age of the newborn child violated the due process clause because the board failed to show a reasonable justification for this regulation. In contrast, the Chesterfield School Board only required that teachers demonstrate good health, guaranteeing them re-employment by the beginning of the next school year. This was a reasonable and narrow method of protecting the school\u0027s interest in teacher fitness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Louis Powell concurred in the result. He questioned the majority\u0027s conclusion that some of the maternity leave requirements amounted to an irrebuttable presumption of unfitness. Instead, Justice Powell argued that the board\u0027s classifications violated the female teachers\u0027 right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because they were not rationally related to the school\u0027s legitimate interest in fostering continuity of teaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger, dissented. He argued that while the school boards\u0027 rules may have been arbitrary in particular cases, this was not enough to show that the rules themselves were unconstitutional. He noted that both parties conceded that the probability of physical impairment increased as a pregnancy advanced, and suggested that the line drawn by the boards was not irrational.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38014,"name":"Philip J.

Widower Mel Kahn applied to the Dade County Tax Assessor’s Office for the property tax exemption, which was denied. He sued in circuit court and sought a declaratory judgment. The circuit court held that the statute was gender-based and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Florida Supreme Court reversed and held that the gender classification had a “fair and substantial relation” to the purpose of the legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Florida statute that only provides property tax exemptions to widows violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that single women face significantly more hardship in the job market than single men, and the disparity is particularly true for surviving spouses. While widowers can generally continue in the job they held previously, many widows find themselves entering the job market for the first time or after an extended absence. Based on these differences, the Court held that the gender classification in the Florida statute has a “fair and substantial relation” to the legislation’s purpose of softening the financial impact of the loss of a spouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued classifications based on characteristics over which individuals have no control, such as gender, must be subject to strict judicial scrutiny. In such cases, the government must prove not only that such classifications serve a compelling government interest, but also that the interest cannot be served by any other classification. In this case, he argued that the purpose of the legislation could be achieved without gender-based discrimination. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Byron R. White wrote that gender-based classifications require significant justification that Florida did not provide.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41701,"name":"Sydney H.

Employees asked them to stop, but they did not, so the employees called the police. The police informed them that they would be arrested under a Georgia criminal statute if they did not stop, so they left. The next day Steffel and another individual returned to hand out flyers. The police were called again, and Steffel left to avoid arrest. The other individual, however, was arrested. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffel sued and argued that his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated because his fear of being arrested kept him from distributing flyers. The district court dismissed the action and denied all relief after it found no evidence that the state acted in bad faith and therefore there was no active controversy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the case present an actual and active controversy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan a federal court grant declaratory relief against the enforcement of a state statute when a criminal proceeding is pending?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the case presented an actual controversy, as the Georgia statute could interfere with Steffel’s exercise of his constitutional rights even if he was not arrested. Because the United States’ involvement in Vietnam, which Steffel was protesting, was reduced, the issue of whether or not the case still presented an active controversy would be decided by the lower court on remand. The Court also held that awarding declaratory relief would not interfere with the state’s prosecution, and therefore is not precluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion and argued that plaintiffs in such constitutional cases must prove that the state’s actions represented a “genuine threat” to their constitutional liberties, which he predicts will be rare. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Byron R. White wrote that it would not be improper to issue declaratory or injunctive relief in state courts on issues that have already been decided by federal courts. He also argues that such measures should not be necessary because the decisions of federal courts carry more weight than precedents in state courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a concurring opinion and argued that issuing declaratory relief does not allow a plaintiff to avoid prosecution under state law. He also argued that this opinion does not provide support for the ability of federal courts to grant injunctive relief just because declarative relief was appropriate. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27565,"name":"Howard Moore, Jr.","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/howard_moore_jr","view_count":0,"last_name":"Moore,","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"howard_moore_jr"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9384"},{"advocate":{"ID":34279,"name":"Lawrence M.

T. Grant Company and fell behind on payments. W. T. Grant sued Mitchell in state court to recover the $574.17 balance. Pursuant to Louisiana law, W. T. Grant offered proof that it had a vendor\u0027s lien on the property and that Mitchell owed a balance and asked the court to issue a writ of sequestration to retain and hold the property pending the outcome of the suit. The trial court approved the writ without notifying Mitchell or allowing him an opportunity to defend his right to the property at a hearing. Mitchell moved to dissolve the writ of sequestration and argued that seizing his property without notice or an opportunity to defend his interest in the property violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. The trial court, the appellate court, and the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected Mitchell\u0027s argument and held that W. T. Grant\u0027s course of conduct ensured Mitchell\u0027s due process by proceeding according to Louisiana law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes sequestration of a debtor\u0027s property without providing the debtor notice or a hearing to defend an interest in the property violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White wrote the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that Louisiana\u0027s procedure for sequestering property provided both the buyer and the seller with a fair opportunity to secure and defend their respective interests in the challenged property. W. T. Grant Company provided a sworn statement documenting proof of the debt, the lien, and delinquency, all of which showed the judge that Mitchell\u0027s title to the property was encumbered. Additional safeguards in the Louisiana law required creditors to place a bond down at the time of sequestration to secure the buyer\u0027s interests should the proceedings show that sequestration was wrongful. The Court held that these safeguards, coupled with Louisiana\u0027s interest in preventing the buyer from transferring or concealing the property to the detriment of the creditor, justified sequestration without notice or a hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote that the majority opinion overturned the rule established in \u003cem\u003eFuentes v. Shevin\u003c/em\u003e. In that case, the Court held that procedural due process required \"an adversary hearing before an individual may be temporarily deprived of any possessory interest in . . . property.\" Justice Powell argued that the \u003cem\u003eFuentes\u003c/em\u003e rule was unnecessarily broad and that the narrower grounds the majority set forth represented a better balance of the interests of creditors and debtors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the Court should adhere to the \u003cem\u003eFuentes\u003c/em\u003e rule. According to this rule, the Louisiana procedures violated due process by allowing the government to deprive a person of property with no advance notice or opportunity to be heard. Justice William O. Douglas, Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39482,"name":"Robert J.

The Act included a provision in 25 U.S.C. Section 472 that gave hiring preference Native Americans for positions in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Congress then passed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, which prohibited racial discrimination in federal employment. In June 1972, the BIA extended Indian preference to both hiring and promotion decisions. C.R. Mancari was a non- Indian employee of the BIA. He and other non-Indian employees of the BIA filed a class action in United States District Court for the District of New Mexico. They claimed that Section 472 was repealed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. They also claimed that Section 472 violated the Fifth Amendment and their right to property without due process. The District Court ruled in their favor. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 repeal Section 472 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did Section 472 violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. The Court reversed the District Court. The 1972 Act did not explicitly repeal Section 472. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for a unanimous Court, cited the long history of Indian employment preference as exceptions to prohibitions against employment discrimination. Congress had also passed two Indian preference statutes after the 1972 Act, showing that Congress did not intend implicitly to repeal Section 472. In addition, the Court held that Section 472 did not constitute discrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Again, Justice Blackmun cited the history of \"special treatment\" granted to Indians. The preference for Indians in Section 472 was not \"a \u0027racial\u0027 preference\", but rather \"an employment criterion reasonably designed to further the cause of Indian self-government.\" Section 472 went towards the \"fulfillment of Congress\u0027 unique obligation towards the Indians,\" and was therefore not in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28145,"name":"Harry R.

That case reached a final judgment in May 1968, when all parties agreed to terms that prevented the companies from engaging in future violations of anti-trust laws. Eleven days short of one year after this agreement, the State of Utah, on behalf of several agencies and local governments, filed a class action lawsuit against the same corporations. The lawsuit claimed that the corporations’ previous price fixing schemes had directly injured the State and other plaintiffs. Six months later, the corporations successfully argued that, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the lawsuit could not be maintained as a class action because it was not impractical for the plaintiffs to each have individual representation. Eight days following this ruling, over 60 towns, municipalities, and water districts within the State of Utah immediately filed motions to intervene in the lawsuit. The court denied their motions because they had failed to argue them within the one-year time statute of limitations required under federal law. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. First, that court held that, by filing lawsuit as a class action, all of the claims were adequately before the trial court before the statute of limitations was reached. However, because the judge dismissed the class action after the statute of limitations ran, the parties were unable to re-file their claims against the corporations. That court held that the trial judge could not leave the plaintiff’s without recourse after the time to file the lawsuit had passed. Instead, the plaintiffs should have the eleven days that remained under the statute of limitations when the initial lawsuit was filed in order to intervene or otherwise file individual claims. The corporations appealed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes dismissal of a class action lawsuit after the statute of limitations has expired prevents previous class members from either filing individual lawsuits against the defendant or otherwise joining an existing claim?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a unanimous Court, affirmed the Ninth Circuit.The Supreme Court held that commencing a class action suspends all applicable statutes of limitations against members of that class who would have been parties had the suit been allowed to continue as a class action. Justice Stewart noted that the policies behind statutes of limitations are to ensure fairness to defendants by “preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.” Those policies, however, are satisfied when a plaintiff initiates a class action lawsuit because defendants know a named plaintiff and the number and generic identities of potential plaintiffs. Finally, the Court noted that eleven days remained under the statute of limitations when the class action was initially filed. Therefore, the motions to intervene that were filed within eight days of the judge’s dismissal were valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32257,"name":"Jesse R.

He failed to report several times. The draft board declared him a delinquent, and issued an order that he be inducted into the Armed Forces. Under 32 CFR Section 1631.7, a draftee could only be ordered to report for induction if he was deemed \"acceptable for service\" after a physical examination and if the board had mailed him a statement of his status with three weeks\u0027 notice. The statute provided an exception for draftees that were declared delinquent, accelerating the process. Davis was convicted in United States District Court for the Central District of California for his failures to report, and he appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While his case was pending, the Supreme Court decided \u003cem\u003eGutknecht v. United States\u003c/em\u003e. Gutknecht involved a similar situation, in which a draftee\u0027s induction was accelerated by his delinquent status. The Supreme Court declared Gutknecht\u0027s conviction invalid. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court, which held that Davis\u0027 case was not impacted by \u003cem\u003eGutknecht\u003c/em\u003e. This ruling was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit. Davis petitioned for certiorari. During this process, the Ninth Circuit ruled in \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Fox\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eFox\u003c/em\u003e involved a situation similar to Davis\u0027. Fox\u0027s conviction was reversed by the Ninth Circuit. Meanwhile, Davis\u0027 petition for certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court, and he began serving his prison sentence. Davis then challenged his conviction under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255. Davis asserted that in the process of his conviction, the Ninth Circuit\u0027s ruling in \u003cem\u003eFox\u003c/em\u003e changed the law. The District Court ruled against him. The Ninth Circuit affirmed on the ground that it had already ruled against him on the same issue. Davis then appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Davis entitled to challenge his conviction under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 decision, the Court held that Davis could challenge his conviction under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255. Writing for the majority, Justice Potter Stewart quoted the government\u0027s acknowledgment that the Ninth Circuit\u0027s opinion was \"not consonant with this Court\u0027s holding in \u003cem\u003eSanders v. United States\u003c/em\u003e.\" The Court rejected the government\u0027s suggestion that Section 2255 did not apply because Davis\u0027 challenge was not grounded in the Constitution. Since \"new law has been made...since the trial and appeal\" through the Ninth Circuit\u0027s later holding in \u003cem\u003eFox\u003c/em\u003e, Davis was entitled to a challenge under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. concurred in part and dissented in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36111,"name":"Marvin M.

When officers came to his house he offered to take the flag down, but was arrested, charged, and convicted under a Washington statute that forbade the display of an American flag to which figures symbols or other extraneous material is attached or superimposed.  Spence was not charged under the state flag desecration statute.  The Washington Court of Appeals reversed, but the Washington Supreme Court reversed and reinstated the conviction.

Blackmun concurred in the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented, arguing that each state should decide how the American flag should be protected.

The \u003cem\u003eMiami Herald\u003c/em\u003e published two editorials criticizing Tornillo and his candidacy. He demanded that the \u003cem\u003eHerald\u003c/em\u003e publish his responses to the editorials. When the \u003cem\u003eHerald\u003c/em\u003e refused, Tornillo sued in Dade County Circuit Court under Florida Statute Section 104.38, which granted political candidates criticized by any newspaper the right to have their responses to the criticisms published. The \u003cem\u003eHerald\u003c/em\u003e challenged the statute as a violation of the free press clause of the First Amendment. The Circuit Court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Florida reversed this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Florida Statute Section 104.38, the \"right to reply\" statute, violate the free press clause of the First Amendment applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous decision, the Court reversed the Supreme Court of Florida and held that Florida\u0027s \"right to reply\" statute violated the freedom of press found in the First Amendment. In an opinion written by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the Court recognized the risks posed to the \"true marketplace of ideas\" by media consolidation and barriers to entry in the newspaper industry. However, even in that context, \"press responsibility is not mandated by the Constitution and…cannot be legislated.\" The statute was an \"intrusion into the function of editors,\" and imposed \"a penalty on the basis of the content.\" Chief Justice Burger relied on \u003cem\u003eNew York Times v. Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e in that the \"right to reply\" statute \"limits the variety of public debate,\" and was therefore unconstitutional. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. authored a concurring statement. Justice Byron R. White authored a concurring opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21368,"name":"Daniel P. S.

In a magazine called American Opinion, the John Birch Society accused Gertz of being a \"Leninist\" and a \"Communist-fronter\" because he chose to represent clients who were suing a law enforcement officer. Gertz won a jury verdict and an award of $50,000 but lost his libel suit because the trial judge found that the magazine had not violated the actual malice test for libel which the Supreme Court had established in \u003cem\u003eNew York Times v. Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e (1964). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the trial judge\u0027s ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment allow a newspaper or broadcaster to assert defamatory falsehoods about an individual who is neither a public official nor a public figure?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed the lower court decision, holding that Gertz\u0027s rights had been violated and ordering a new trial. Justice Powell argued that the application of the New York Times v. Sullivan standard in this case was inappropriate because Gertz was neither a public official nor a public figure. In the context of the opinion, Powell advanced many lines of reasoning to establish that ordinary citizens should be allowed more protection from libelous statements than individuals in the public eye. First, the recklessness standard applies only to defamation of public figures or public officials. Second, even for private individuals, states may not impose strict liability on news media. And third, any standard of fault less then recklessness limits private persons to actual injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun write a concurring opinion signing on to the reasoning and outcome of the majority. Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and William O. Douglas dissenting, arguing that the failure to apply the New York Times v. Sullivan standard to private persons involved in public matters would stifle \"free and robust debate.\" Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Byron R. White joined the majority in reversing the Court of Appeals ruling but would have simply reinstated the jury verdict and damage award. They disagreed with the majority\u0027s refashioning of state libel laws involving private individuals and the news media.  \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44818,"name":"Wayne B.

The statute’s meaning of “family” was one or more related persons or not more than two unrelated people. The appellees owned a house and leased it to unrelated people, in violation of the Village’s ordinance. When the Village asked the respondents to remedy the violation, the homeowners sued the Village seeking a judgment that declared the ordinance unconstitutional because it violated the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by interfering with the right to travel and by expressing impermissible social preferences. The district court held the ordinance was constitutional, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. The appellate court determined that the ordinance was an attempt to ensure that residents conformed to social preferences of living style and had no relevance to public health, safety, or welfare.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an ordinance restricting land use to “one-family” dwellings violate the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eAn ordinance restricting land use to “one-family” dwellings did not involve a procedural disparity, did not deprive any group of a fundamental right, and is rationally related to a permissible government objective. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that the Village of Belle Terre’s ordinance restricting land use to one-family dwellings did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the ordinance was not arbitrary, did not unreasonably apply to some individuals and not others, and was reasonably related to a rational state objective. The Court also held that the ordinance did not violate the Due Process Clause because it did not deny anyone a fundamental right such as the rights to travel, association, and privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent in which he argued that this case was moot because the unrelated tenants to whom the homeowners leased were no longer living in the house when this case was decided. There was no case or controversy as Article III of the Constitution requires. Justice Brennan explained that he would vacate and remand the judgment, and if the lower court determined that the case was moot, as he suggested, then the case should be dismissed. In his separate dissent, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote that the ordinance “unnecessarily burdens” the lessor appellees’ right to privacy and First Amendment right to freedom of association. The Village’s legitimate interests in controlling land use could be fulfilled by limiting the number of people dwelling in a single residence without specifying that they need to be related or unrelated.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17654,"name":"Bernard E.

Pugh was denied bail and Henderson was unable to post a $4,500 bond, so both remained in custody. Florida law only required indictments for capitol offenses, so Pugh and Henderson were charged only by information, without a preliminary hearing and without leave of the court. Florida courts previously held that filing an information foreclosed an accused’s right to a preliminary hearing, and that habeas corpus could not be used except in exceptional circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePugh and Henderson filed a class action against Dade County officials, claiming a constitutional right to a preliminary hearing on the issue of probable cause. The district court certified the class and held that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments give all arrested persons charged by information the right to a preliminary hearing. The Florida Supreme Court adopted new rules in an attempt to fix the problem, but on remand, the district court held the rules still violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court also prescribed detailed procedures to protect that right. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and vacated in part, modifying minor portions of the district court’s prescribed procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a person in state custody have a constitutional right to a preliminary hearing?\u003cbr /\u003eDoes a U.S. District Court judge have jurisdiction to interfere in a state criminal proceeding on the question of preliminary hearings?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., writing for a unanimous court affirmed in part and reversed in part remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit. The Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment entitles a person arrested without a warrant and charged by information to a timely preliminary hearing on probable cause. The prosecutor’s decision to file an information does not provide sufficient protection. Five members of the court agreed that the district court’s prescribed procedures were not required by the Fourth Amendment. The case was remanded for reconsideration of these procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart concurred, writing that it was unnecessary to specify which procedural protections do not need to be provided to suspects awaiting trial. Justice William O. Douglas, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34878,"name":"Leonard Mellon","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/leonard_mellon","view_count":0,"last_name":"Mellon","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"leonard_mellon"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9526"},{"advocate":{"ID":39907,"name":"Raymond L.

The California Department of Corrections had regulations which censored mail and which prohibited law students and legal paraprofessionals from conducing interviews with the inmates. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartinez and other prisoners in the California corrections system filed suit against officials in the California Department of Corrections in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of the aforementioned regulations. The district court decided in favor of the prisoners, and the officials from the department of corrections appealed.  \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Should a district court abstain from determining the constitutional validity of administrative rules established by the California Department of Corrections when there were state laws addressing the validity of such regulations? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the Constitution compel California to give law students and legal paraprofessionals the full range of privileges accorded to attorneys in their meetings with inmates? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and Yes. Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote for a unanimous Court and affirmed the lower court\u0027s opinion. The Court held that it was proper for the district court to refuse to abstain from deciding the constitutionality of the regulations. The Court further held that the censorship of direct personal correspondence created incidental restrictions on the right to free speech for both prisoners and their correspondents. Therefore, the speech could only be restricted if it furthered a substantial government interest and was narrowly tailored to further that interest. Under this rule, the policy censoring mail was unconstitutional. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall filed a concurring opinion, which Justice William J. Brennan joined. Justice Marshall emphasized his opinion that the prison authorities did not have a general right to open and read all incoming and outgoing prison mail. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote separately that prisoners were still entitled to all constitutional rights which were not curtailed by procedures that satisfied all the requirements of due process. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44365,"name":"W.

Lehman wanted to have his campaign advertisements placed on the side of Shaker Heights\u0027 streetcars. Metromedia, Inc. was designated by the city to manage that advertising space. Metromedia\u0027s contract with the city prohibited it from placing political advertisements on the streetcars. It was allowed, however, to place advertisements from businesses and public service groups. Lehman\u0027s request was denied, and he sued in the Ohio Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County alleging that Shaker Heights\u0027 policy violated his free speech rights. The Ohio Court of Appeals ruled for the city. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Shaker Heights\u0027 policy against political advertising on its streetcars violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision, the Court affirmed the Supreme Court of Ohio and found no violation of the First or Fourteenth Amendments. Writing for a plurality of four justices, Justice Harry A. Blackmun asserted that \"no First Amendment forum is here to be found,\" as the streetcars did not qualify as a \"public thoroughfare.\" Accordingly, the city \"need not accept every proffer of advertising.\" The city could reject certain types of advertising as long as the policies were not \"arbitrary, capricious, or invidious.\" Given the \"reasonable legislative objectives\" of minimizing \"chances of abuse, the appearance of favoritism, and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience,\" Shaker Heights\u0027 policy was not unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35067,"name":"Leonard J.

As a result, the San Francisco school system absorbed over 2,856 students of Chinese ancestry who were not proficient in English. Of these students, the school system only provided about 1,000 with supplemental English language courses. Classes were taught exclusively in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLau and other students of Chinese descent who did not speak English and received no supplemental English courses brought a class action suit against the officials in the San Francisco Unified School District. The students claimed that the failure to provide supplemental English classes constituted an unequal educational opportunity in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court denied relief, holding that the policies of the school system did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or the Civil Rights Act. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, and a hearing en banc was denied. The students appealed the appellate court\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a school district violate the Fourteenth Amendment or the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it teaches exclusively in English and fails to provide non-English speaking students with any supplemental English language classes? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William O. Douglas wrote for a unanimous court. The Court determined that the school system\u0027s failure to provide supplemental English language instruction to students of Chinese ancestry who spoke no English constituted a violation of the California Education Code in the SFUSD Handbook and Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it deprived those students of an opportunity to participate in the public education program. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote an opinion concurring with the result, which was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Harry Blackmun. He discussed the appropriateness of the statutory guidelines mandating affirmative remedial efforts for linguistically deprived children. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry Blackmun also wrote an opinion concurring with the result, which was joined by Justice Burger. The justice stressed that 1,800 children were being deprived of meaningful schooling in this matter. He limited the Court\u0027s holding by stating that, if only a few children spoke a language other than English, the Court\u0027s decision would not necessarily require supplemental language instruction. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23235,"name":"Edward H.

Although already representing the majority of letter carriers, the Branch was involved in an ongoing campaign to convince the remaining letter carriers to join the organization. As part of this effort, the Branch’s monthly newsletter published a list of those who had not yet joined the union under the heading “List of Scabs.” After his name appeared twice in the list, Henry Austin complained to the Richmond Postmaster and the President of the Branch. Several weeks later, the list appeared again accompanied by a well-known piece of trade literature describing the despicable nature of a scab. Austin and the other appellees sued for defamation. The appellants moved to dismiss and argued that the publication was protected speech under the First Amendment and federal libel laws. The trial court judge instructed the jury that state libel laws were applicable to such speech if the jury found that the statements were made with actual malice. The jury found in favor of the appellees and awarded damages. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment protect speech in labor dispute cases from the application of state libel laws?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that federal law such as the National Labor Relations Act supports an environment for robust labor debate that allows for “intemperate, abusive, or insulting language” if it effectively makes a point. The Court also held that such language could not be interpreted as a false representation of fact and so maintained their First Amendment protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the First Amendment and its application to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit both the states and the federal government from limiting speech in federal labor disputes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the majority unnecessarily extended the reach of federal labor law. He wrote that state libel laws represented the overriding state interest in allowing individuals redress for harms to their reputations. In this case, the individuals in question did not represent an economic threat to the union, so the speech should not be protected from state libel laws. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36527,"name":"Mozart G.
