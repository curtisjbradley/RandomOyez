Even if the state law imposes burdens or waste, the legislature has the sole authority over weighing its benefits against its costs.

They were travelling door-to-door and approaching people on the street. Two pedestrians reacted angrily to an anti-Catholic message. Cantwell and his sons were arrested and charged with: (1) violation of a Connecticut statute requiring solicitors to obtain a certificate before soliciting funds from the public, and (2) inciting a common-law breach of the peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Cantwells’ convictions violate the First Amendment? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court held the Cantwells’ actions were protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Writing for the Court, Justice Owen Roberts reasoned that while general regulations on solicitation were legitimate, restrictions based on religious grounds were not. Because the statute allowed local officials to determine which causes were religious and which ones were not, it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also held that while the maintenance of public order was a valid state interest, it could not be used to justify the suppression of \"free communication of views.\" The Cantwells\u0027 message, while offensive to many, did not threaten \"bodily harm\" and was protected religious speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26711,"name":"Hayden C.

When a lumber manufacturer, Darby, shipped lumber out of state, he was arrested for violating the FLSA. His charges were dismissed because the federal district court found that FLSA was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the FLSA’s potential effects on intrastate activities violated the Commerce Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the Act a legitimate exercise of Congress\u0027s power to regulate interstate commerce?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe unanimous Court upheld the FLSA. Relying heavily on the Court\u0027s decision in Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), Justice Stone  affirmed the constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, which \"can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state power.\" The Court held that the purpose of the FLSA was to prevent states from using substandard labor practices to their own economic advantage by interstate commerce. Congress acted with proper authority in outlawing substandard labor conditions since they have a significant impact on interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23660,"name":"Francis B.

The group did not apply for a permit. They were convicted in municipal court for violating the statute prohibiting unlicensed parades. The Superior Court conducted a new trial before a jury that also found the defendants guilty, and the Supreme Court of New Hampshire affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the New Hampshire state statute that prohibits unlicensed parades violate the First Amendment\u0027s guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Court held that a municipality\u0027s ability to impose regulations that create order and safety for its populace does not infringe on the civil liberties of its people. Because the statute in question only grants a town selectman or licensing board the limited authority to ensure that a proposed parade will not interfere with the proper uses of streets, there is not opportunity for it to wield undue or arbitrary power that would infringe on constitutional rights. The Court also held that there was no evidence that the statute had been administered unfairly in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"312","page":"569","year":"1941","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27286"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15349,"name":"Hughes Court (1941)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/hughes16","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15038,"name":"Charles E.

Bridges implied that he would have his union go on strike if the Superior Court ruled unfavorably. A copy of the telegram was given to James D. O\u0027Neil, who distributed the telegram to various West Coast Newspapers. The Superior Court found Bridges in contempt of court and fined him. Similarly, the \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times\u003c/em\u003e was also found in contempt of court and fined for publishing several editorials regarding a case pending in the Superior Court. Bridges and the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e challenged their punishments separately in the Superior Court. The Superior Court upheld their fines, and both appealed separately to the Supreme Court of California. The California Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court.

Chaplinsky called the town marshal \"a God-damned racketeer\" and \"a damned Fascist.\" He was arrested and convicted under a state law that prohibited intentionally offensive, derisive, or annoying speech to any person who is lawfully in a street or public area. On appeal, Chaplinsky argued that the law violated the First Amendment on the grounds that it was overly vague. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Chaplinsky’s conviction violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWriting for a unanimous Court, Justice Frank Murphy upheld Chaplinsky’s conviction. The Court identified certain categorical exceptions to First Amendment protections, including obscenities, certain profane and slanderous speech, and \"fighting words.\" He found that Chaplinsky\u0027s insults were “fighting words” since they caused a direct harm to their target and could be construed to advocate an immediate breach of the peace. Thus, they lacked the social value of disseminating ideas to the public that lay behind the rights granted by the First Amendment. A state can use its police power, the Court reasoned, to curb their expression in the interests of maintaining order and morality. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26711,"name":"Hayden C.

The Court reasoned that while the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits an unfair trial, the amendment does not embody “an inexorable command that no trial for any offense, or in any court, can be fairly conducted and justice accorded a defendant who is not represented by counsel.” The majority opinion concluded that indigent defendants need only be provided with a lawyer under special circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Black dissented, arguing that denial of counsel based on financial stability makes it so that those in poverty have an increased chance of conviction, which violates the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis decision was overruled in 1963 in \u003cem\u003eGideon v.

Following the declaration of war between the United States and Germany, eight German residents, Richard Quirin, Ernst Burger, George Dasch, Herbert Haupt, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Keiling, Herman Neubauer, and Werener Thiel, received training on sabotage at a school near Berlin. The men traveled to the United States via submarine. On the night of June 13, 1942, Burger, Heinrich, Quirin, and Dasch landed near Long Island, New York wearing German uniforms and carrying explosives. On the night of June 17, 1942, the remaining four came ashore in similar fashion at Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Shortly after the landings, Burger and Dasch backed out of the mission. Dasch turned himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigations. All eight conspirators were subsequently arrested and, on the orders of President Franklin Roosevelt, tried by military commission. The commission found all eight men guilty and sentenced them to death. Because of their confessions and cooperation, President Roosevelt later commuted Burger and Dasch\u0027s sentences to life in prison. Arguing that the President exceeded his power in ordering the commission and that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution protect their rights to a regular trial, seven of the eight conspirators, not including Dasch, filed petitions for a writ of \u003cem\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/em\u003e in Federal District Court. Their claims were denied, and they appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Before the court ruled, however, they filed for hearing before the Supreme Court and, separately, filed petitions for \u003cem\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/em\u003e directly with the Court. The Court, sitting in a special term, agreed to hear the cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the President exceed his authority in ordering a trial by military commission for the German saboteurs, thereby violating their rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion authored by Chief Justice Harlan Fisk Stone, the Court concluded that the conspirators, as spies without uniform whose purpose was sabotage, violated the law of war and were therefore unlawful enemy combatants. Noting that Congress had, under the Articles of War, authorized trial by military commission for unlawful enemy combatants, the Court therefore determined that the President had not exceeded his power. Furthermore, the Court asserted that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments \"did not enlarge the right to jury trial\" beyond those cases where it was understood by the framers to have been appropriate. Therefore, because the amendments cannot be read \"as either abolishing all trials by military tribunals, save those of the personnel of our own armed forces, or, what in effect comes to the same thing, as imposing on all such tribunals the necessity of proceeding against unlawful enemy belligerents only on presentment and trial by jury,\" the rights of the conspirators were not violated.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"317","page":"1","year":"1942","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27294"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15268,"name":"Stone Court (1941-1942)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/stone3","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15134,"name":"Harlan Fiske Stone","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harlan_fiske_stone","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stone","roles":[{"id":2779,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1414864800,"date_end":-899406000,"appointing_president":"Calvin Coolidge","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2779"},{"id":2780,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-899319600,"date_end":-747770400,"appointing_president":"Franklin D.

The Act restricted competition among producers in order to stabilize prices. Brown, a raisin producer, attempted to enjoin enforcement of the Act on the ground that he was sustaining irreparable economic injuries under the program because of its regulations on contracts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the California Act violate the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court held that the program created by the California Prorate Act of 1933 was a regulation of state industry of local concern that did not impair national control over commerce. The Court noted that states had authority to regulate local matters so long as they did not materially obstruct commerce. The Court also found that the effects of the California Act paralleled the desired effects of congressional legislation. Since both California and the Congress were attempting to stabilize agricultural prices, no conflict between local and national interests was present.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"317","page":"341","year":"1943","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27296"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15268,"name":"Stone Court (1941-1942)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/stone3","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15134,"name":"Harlan Fiske Stone","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harlan_fiske_stone","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stone","roles":[{"id":2779,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1414864800,"date_end":-899406000,"appointing_president":"Calvin Coolidge","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2779"},{"id":2780,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-899319600,"date_end":-747770400,"appointing_president":"Franklin D.

Robert Murdock was a Jehovah\u0027s Witness who canvassed door to door within Jeannette, offering religious texts in exchange for donations. He and other Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses were arrested, convicted, and fined for violating the ordinance. The Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses appealed to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, alleging that the ordinance violated the Free Speech, Free Press, and Free Exercise of Religion clauses of the First Amendment. The Superior Court upheld the ordinance and their convictions, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declined to hear their appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs it unconstitutional for a state to tax people selling religious merchandise?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 decision, the Court held the ordinance was unconstitutional. Writing for the majority, Justice William O. Douglas equated the power to impose a tax on First Amendment freedoms, such as the free exercise of religion, with the power of censorship. The tax did not just apply to the sale of books or religious pamphlets, but also to door-to-door preaching done in connection with solicitation of funds necessary for a religious sect to sustain itself. According to the Court, the requirement that individuals pay a fee in order to exercise their freedoms will inevitably lead to their suppression. Thus, the Court declared the license tax unconstitutional as applied to religious activities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Frankfurter, Jackson, Reed, and Roberts dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"319","page":"105","year":"1943","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27297"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15271,"name":"Stone Court (1943-1945)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/stone5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15134,"name":"Harlan Fiske Stone","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harlan_fiske_stone","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stone","roles":[{"id":2779,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1414864800,"date_end":-899406000,"appointing_president":"Calvin Coolidge","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2779"},{"id":2780,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-899319600,"date_end":-747770400,"appointing_president":"Franklin D.

The children in a family of Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses refused to perform the salute and were sent home from school for non-compliance. They were also threatened with reform schools used for criminally active children, and their parents faced prosecutions for causing juvenile delinquency.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the compulsory flag-salute for public schoolchildren violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-3 decision, the Court overruled its decision in \u003cem\u003eMinersville School District v. Gobitis\u003c/em\u003e and held that compelling public schoolchildren to salute the flag was unconstitutional. In an opinion written by Robert Houghwout Jackson, the Court found that the First Amendment cannot enforce a unanimity of opinion on any topic, and national symbols like the flag should not receive a level of deference that trumps constitutional protections. He argued that curtailing or eliminating dissent was an improper and ineffective way of generating unity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Black and Douglas concurred to repudiate their earlier opinions in First Amendment decisions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Frankfurter dissented.

He issued two executive orders which were quickly enacted into law. One gave the Secretary of War the power to designate certain parts of the country \"military areas\" and exclude certain persons from them. The second established the War Relocation Authority which had the power to remove, maintain, and supervise persons who were excluded from the military areas. Gordon Kiyoshi Hirabayashi, a student at the University of Washington, was convicted of violating a curfew and relocation order.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the President\u0027s executive orders and the power delegated to the military authorities discriminate against Americans and resident aliens of Japanese descent in violation of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found the President\u0027s orders and the implementation of the curfew to be constitutional. Chief Justice Stone, writing for the unanimous Court, took into account the great importance of military installations and weapons production that occurred on the West Coast and the \"solidarity\" that individuals of Japanese descent felt with their motherland. He reasoned that restrictions on Japanese actions served an important national interest.

This case is the consolidation of two cases in which the defendants were tried and convicted in district court on several counts of selling wholesale cuts of beef at prices above the maximum prices set by the Revised Maximum Price Regulation under the Act. During the trial, the district court overruled all motions regarding the validity of the Regulation and the Act, including questions of whether the Act deprived the defendants of their Fifth Amendment rights to due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the Emergency Price Act of 1942 represent an unconstitutional delegation of power from the legislative branch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Do the regulations provide adequate opportunity for review to meet the demands of due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes. Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that Congress sufficiently regulated the powers of the Administrator of the Act in such a way as to be a constitutional delegation of legislative power to obtain a particular objective. The Constitution grants Congress the necessary flexibility to perform its legislative function in a variety of ways. Because the regulations and standards are specific enough to ensure that the enforcement of the Act is conforming to the congressional intent behind it, it is constitutional. The Court also held that, because the Act establishes a procedure for redress for those who feel they have been wronged by the Act, it does not violate due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Owen J. Roberts wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the Administrator of the Act. Because the standards set by the Act leave many decisions up to the judgment of the Administrator, they cannot be sufficiently overseen by Congress. He also argued that the standard for review of the regulations relies too heavily on the Administrator to be impartial, as it is the Administrator who sets the regulations in the first place. In his dissent, Justice Wiley B. Rutledge argued that the way in which Congress conferred jurisdiction over the Act onto state and federal courts while creating a separate system for the redress of wrongs was unconstitutional. He wrote that Congress cannot require a court to enforce regulations without allowing the court to consider their constitutional validity. Such a piecemeal approach to due process denies the defendants their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. Justice Frank Murphy joined in the dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31310,"name":"Joseph Kruger","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/joseph_kruger","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kruger","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"joseph_kruger"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner, 374","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21656"},{"advocate":{"ID":34965,"name":"Leonard Poretsky","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/leonard_poretsky","view_count":0,"last_name":"Poretsky","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"leonard_poretsky"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners, 374 and 375","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21657"},{"advocate":{"ID":45289,"name":"William H.

President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor. A Japanese-American man living in San Leandro, Fred Korematsu, chose to stay at his residence rather than obey the order to relocate. Korematsu was arrested and convicted of violating the order. He responded by arguing that Executive Order 9066 violated the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed Korematsu\u0027s conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the President and Congress go beyond their war powers by implementing exclusion and restricting the rights of Americans of Japanese descent?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion written by Justice Black, the Court ruled that the evacuation order violated by Korematsu was valid. The majority found that the Executive Order did not show racial prejudice but rather responded to the strategic imperative of keeping the U.S. and particularly the West Coast (the region nearest Japan) secure from invasion. The Court relied heavily on a 1943 decision, Hirabayashi v. U.S., which addressed similar issues. Black argued that the validation of the military\u0027s decision by Congress merited even more deference. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Frankfurter concurred, writing that the “martial necessity arising from the danger of espionage and sabotage” warranted the military’s evacuation order. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Jackson dissented, arguing that the exclusion order legitimized racism that violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44238,"name":"Wayne M.

It sought to recover these penalties from Southern Pacific Co., but the trial court made detailed factual findings that led it to conclude that Southern Pacific was not liable because the law violated the Commerce Clause. The Arizona Supreme Court reversed on the grounds that the law was reasonably related to the health and safety of the state\u0027s citizens and that the state had properly based it on its police power. It held that this foundation insulated it from challenges under the Commerce Clause, even though it had an adverse effect on interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Arizona law violate the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Harlan F. Stone, the plurality struck down the law. The Court reasoned that that the law imposed a great burden on interstate commerce because nearly all the freight and passenger rail traffic in Arizona was interstate traffic, meaning that even trains operating outside Arizona had to comply with the law. As a result, 30% more trains than previously used were needed because of the limitation on the number of trains per car, at an added cost of $1,000,000 per year before adjustment for inflation. The Court found that there was insufficient benefit to Arizona\u0027s legitimate health and safety interests to justify so great a burden on interstate commerce. The law had ostensibly been passed to decrease the rate of rail accidents that \"result from the greater length of trains,\" but the court noted that if anything the result of the law might have been to increase accidents \"resulting from the larger number of trains.\"  Accordingly, the law was not reasonably related to the state\u0027s legitimate interest in train safety let alone sufficiently beneficial towards achieving that end that it would justify the burden it imposed on interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Rutledge concurred. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Black and Douglas dissented. \u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"325","page":"761","year":"1945","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27307"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15271,"name":"Stone Court (1943-1945)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/stone5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15134,"name":"Harlan Fiske Stone","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harlan_fiske_stone","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stone","roles":[{"id":2779,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1414864800,"date_end":-899406000,"appointing_president":"Calvin Coolidge","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2779"},{"id":2780,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-899319600,"date_end":-747770400,"appointing_president":"Franklin D.

The Court stressed that conflicts between property rights and constitutional rights should typically be resolved in favor of the latter. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Frankfurter concurred. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Reed, Burton, and Stone dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"326","page":"501","year":"1945","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27309"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15269,"name":"Stone Court (1945-1946)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/stone7","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15134,"name":"Harlan Fiske Stone","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harlan_fiske_stone","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stone","roles":[{"id":2779,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1414864800,"date_end":-899406000,"appointing_president":"Calvin Coolidge","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2779"},{"id":2780,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-899319600,"date_end":-747770400,"appointing_president":"Franklin D.

The farm was located near an airport used regularly by the United States military. According to Causby, noise from the airport regularly frightened the animals on his farm, resulting in the deaths of several chickens. The problem became so severe that Causby was forced to abandon his business. Under an ancient doctrine of the common law, land ownership extended to the space above and below the earth. Using this doctrine as a basis, Causby sued the United States, arguing that he owned the airspace above his farm. By flying planes in this airspace, he argued, the government had confiscated his property without compensation, thus violating the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The United States Court of Claims accepted Causby\u0027s argument, and ordered the government to pay compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the flying of planes by the United States military over Causby\u0027s farm constitute a violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, to an extent. In a 5-2 opinion authored by Justice William O. Douglas, the Court concluded that the ancient common law doctrine \"has no place in the modern world.\" Justice Douglas noted that, were the Court to accept the doctrine as valid, \"every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense revolts at the idea.\" However, while the Court rejected the unlimited reach above and below the earth described in the common law doctrine, it also ruled that, \"if the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere.\" Without defining a specific limit, the Court stated that flights over the land could be considered a violation of the Takings Clause if they led to \"a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land.\" Given the damage caused by the particularly low, frequent flights over his farm, the Court determined that the government had violated Causby\u0027s rights, and he was entitled to compensation. (Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone died on April 22; Justice Robert H. Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision in the case, leaving the court with 7 members.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"328","page":"256","year":"1946","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27310"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15272,"name":"Stone Court (1946)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/stone8","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15089,"name":"Hugo L.

They argued that section of the Act was unconstitutional. None of the appellants, with the exception of George Poole, were facing disciplinary action for violating the Act. The district court held the section in question constitutional and granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was not docketed until more than 60 days after the appeal was allowed. The appellees argued that, because the proper appeals process was not followed, the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction over the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Supreme Court have jurisdiction over an appeal that was not docketed within 60 days from the time the appeal was allowed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the case present a justiciable issue if only one of the appellants was accused of violating the Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the Hatch Act unconstitutionally restrict the rights of employees of the federal government?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, no. Justice Stanley Reed delivered the opinion of the 4-3 plurality. The Supreme Court held that the Court can still hear a case that was not docketed within the appropriate amount of time if dismissal procedures are not followed. The case does present a justiciable issue but only with respect to the appellant who was facing disciplinary action, because the Court cannot rule on hypothetical denials of rights. The Court also held that Congress has historically had the right to reasonably limit the political conduct of its employees to promote integrity in the performance of duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the appeal was not filed during the 60-day period. However, on the merits of the case, he joins in the plurality’s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the section of the Act in question deprived a large number of federal employees of their constitutional rights to fully participate in elections. He also argued that it was the interest of a democratic government to encourage maximum political activity from as many people as possible. Justice Wiley B. Rutledge dissented from the plurality’s decision as it applies to George Poole for the same reasons as those stated by Justice Black. However, he did not think that this case was an appropriate one for addressing the broader constitutional issues. In his partial dissent, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that all of the appellants present justiciable issues, not just Poole, and that the plurality’s opinion should have considered their claims. He also argued that there should be a distinction drawn between administrative employees, who have roles that may be affected by partisanship, and industrial workers, whose jobs do not vary based on the party in power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Frank Murphy and Justice Robert H. Jackson did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34993,"name":"Lee Pressman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/lee_pressman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Pressman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"lee_pressman"},"advocate_description":"For the Appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21557"},{"advocate":{"ID":39216,"name":"Ralph F.

The Champaign County Board of Education authorized a program in which outside religious teachers hired by private third parties provided weekly religious instruction in public schools. The classes were not mandatory. McCollum, an atheist, complained that her son was ostracized for not attending the classes. McCollum eventually sued the school board in 1945, arguing that the religious instruction in the public schools violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the use of the public school system for religious classes violate the First Amendment\u0027s Establishment Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion written by Justice Black, the majority held that program violated the Establishment Clause. The Court reasoned that the use of tax-supported property for religious instruction and the close cooperation between the school authorities and the religious council violated the constitutionally-required separation of church and state. Because pupils were required to attend school and were released in part from this legal duty if they attended the religious classes, the Court found that the Champaign system was \"beyond question a utilization of the tax-established and tax-supported public school system to aid religious groups and to spread the faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his lone dissent, Justice Stanley Forman Reed objected to the majority’s broad interpretation of the Establishment Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44487,"name":"Walter F.

In 1945, an African-American family (the Shelleys) moved into the neighborhood. Louis Kraemer brought suit to enforce the covenant and prevent the Shelleys from moving into their house. A similar lawsuit arose in Detroit, Michigan. Both state supreme courts enforced the covenants because they were private rather than state action. The Supreme Court consolidated the cases on appeal. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Fred Vinson, the Court held that standing alone, racially restrictive covenants do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Private parties may abide by the terms of such a covenant, but they may not seek judicial enforcement of such a covenant, as that would be a state action. Thus, the enforcements of the racially restrictive covenants in state court violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38245,"name":"Philip B.

State law restricted access to the university to blacks, and Sweatt\u0027s application was automatically rejected because of his race. When Sweatt asked the state courts to order his admission, the university attempted to provide separate but equal facilities for black law students.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Texas admissions scheme violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause required that Sweatt be admitted to the university. The Court found that the \"law school for Negroes,\" which was to have opened in 1947, would have been grossly unequal to the University of Texas Law School. The Court argued that the separate school would be inferior in a number of areas, including faculty, course variety, library facilities, legal writing opportunities, and overall prestige. The Court also found that the mere separation from the majority of law students harmed students\u0027 abilities to compete in the legal arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44466,"name":"W.

During his second extension, he became gainfully employed in violation of the terms of his visa, and was ordered to be deported in 1941. Since World War II continued during this period, he was not deported. Kristensen successfully sought to be exempted from military service. Under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, however, this exemption caused him to be ineligible for naturalization as a citizen. He married an American citizen, and after the conclusion of the war, sought to have his deportation suspended under Section 19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917. Since only foreign citizens who were eligible for naturalization could have their deportations suspended, the Attorney General denied Kristensen\u0027s request. Though he was never arrested, he challenged his deportation in United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which dismissed his case. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed this decision, holding that the Selective Training and Service Act applied only to aliens \"residing in the United States\" and Kristensen was not \"residing in the United States\" at the time of his exemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1)Was Kristensen entitled to challenge his deportation in federal court even though he was never arrested?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2)Was Kristensen \"residing in the United States\" at the time of his exemption from military service and therefore ineligible for naturalization?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. In an 7-1 decision, the Court affirmed the Court of Appeals and held that Kristensen was not only entitled to challenge his deportation, but that he was eligible for naturalization. Writing for the majority, Justice Stanley F. Reed established that Kristensen\u0027s case resulted from a federal law, and \"as such a controversy over federal laws, it is within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\" While the Court noted in the ambiguity in the Selective Training and Serivce Act, a regulation stating that all foreign citizens were \"residents\" was issued in May 1942. Since Kristensen \"never declared an intention to become a citizen of the United States\" and sought his exemption before the date he became a \"resident,\" he was still a nonresident when he applied for exemption. As a nonresident, he was not barred from seeking naturalization under the Selective Training and Service Act. Justice Robert H. Jackson authored a concurring opinion. Justice Hugo L. Black concurred in the judgment. Justice Tom C. Clark did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"340","page":"162","year":"1950","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27330"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15333,"name":"Vinson Court (1949-1953)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/vinson5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15064,"name":"Fred M.

Dean Milk Co., which was based in Illinois, sold milk in Illinois and Wisconsin that was pasteurized in plants that were 65 and 85 miles from Madison.

Moreover, reasonable and nondiscriminatory alternatives were available to ensure milk sold in the city was wholesome and properly pasteurized.

The Act made it unlawful to knowingly conspire to teach and advocate the overthrow or destruction of the United States government. The party members who had been petitioning for socialist reforms claimed that the Act violated their First Amendment rights. Party leaders were found guilty and lower courts upheld the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Smith Act violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-2 decision, the Court upheld the convictions of the Communist Party leaders and found that the Smith Act did not \"inherently\" violate the First Amendment. In the plurality opinion, the Court held that there was a distinction between the mere teaching of communist philosophies and active advocacy of those ideas. Such advocacy created a \"clear and present danger\" that threatened the government. Given the gravity of the consequences, the Court held that success or probability of success was not necessary to justify restrictions on the freedom of speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Frankfurter and Jackson concurred in separate opinions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Black and Douglas dissented in separate opinions. Justice Black stressed that the petitioners were not charged with an attempt to overthrow the Government or any overt acts designed to overthrow the Government. They were not even charged with saying anything or writing anything designed to overthrow the Government. The charge was that they agreed to assemble and to talk and publish certain ideas at a later date. “No matter how it is worded, this is a virulent form of prior censorship of speech and press, which I believe the First Amendment forbids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28041,"name":"Harry Sacher","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harry_sacher","view_count":0,"last_name":"Sacher","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"harry_sacher"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21343"},{"advocate":{"ID":25088,"name":"George W.

Acting on their suspicions, the police duplicated the key to Irvine\u0027s residence and installed a microphone inside. Through the microphone, which was moved between several locations within the house, police obtained evidence that was submitted in Irvine\u0027s trial. When Irvine was arrested, he was found in possession of a federal wagering tax stamp as required by federal tax law. Irvine was convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. He challenged his conviction, alleging that his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure (as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment) were violated and therefore the evidence admitted during his state court trial should have been excluded. The California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate Division upheld his conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizure require the exclusion of such evidence in a state court trial for violation of state criminal law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld Irvine\u0027s conviction though without commanding a majority as to the Court\u0027s reasoning. Announcing the judgment and writing for a plurality, Justice Robert H. Jackson acknowledged and criticized the conduct of the police, which \"flagrantly, deliberately, and persistently violated the fundamental principle declared by the Fourth Amendment.\" However, as in \u003cem\u003eWolf v. Colorado\u003c/em\u003e, \"the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure.\" The evidence obtained from the microphone did not have to be excluded from Irvine\u0027s trial, and was admitted consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, though Irvine\u0027s constitutional rights were violated, his conviction was nonetheless valid. Justice Tom C. Clark authored a concurring opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"347","page":"128","year":"1954","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27343"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15304,"name":"Warren Court (1953-1954)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/warren1","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15099,"name":"Earl Warren","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/earl_warren","view_count":0,"last_name":"Warren","roles":[{"id":2743,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-512503200,"date_end":-16570800,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

Claiming that Mexican-Americans were barred from the jury commission that selected juries, and from petit juries, Hernandez\u0027 attorneys tried to quash the indictment. Moreover, Hernandez tried to quash the petit jury panel called for service, because persons of Mexican descent were excluded from jury service in this case. A Mexican-American had not served on a jury in Jackson County in over 25 years and thus, Hernandez claimed that Mexican ancestry citizens were discriminated against as a special class in Jackson County. The trial court denied the motions. Hernandez was found guilty of murder and sentenced by the all-Anglo jury to life in prison. In affirming, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that \"Mexicans are...members of and within the classification of the white race as distinguished from members of the Negro Race\" and rejected the petitioners\u0027 argument that they were a \"special class\" under the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, the court pointed out that \"so far as we are advised, no member of the Mexican nationality\" challenged this classification as white or Caucasian.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs it a denial of the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause to try a defendant of a particular race or ethnicity before a jury where all persons of his race or ancestry have, because of that race or ethnicity, been excluded by the state?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects those beyond the two classes of white or Negro, and extends to other racial groups in communities depending upon whether it can be factually established that such a group exists within a community. In reversing, the Court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment \"is not directed solely against discrimination due to a \u0027two-class theory\u0027\" but in this case covers those of Mexican ancestry. This was established by the fact that the distinction between whites and Mexican ancestry individuals was made clear at the Jackson County Courthouse itself where \"there were two men\u0027s toilets, one unmarked, and the other marked \u0027Colored Men and \u0027Hombres Aqui\u0027 (\u0027Men Here\u0027),\" and by the fact that no Mexican ancestry person had served on a jury in 25 years.

In each of the cases, African American students had been denied admittance to certain public schools based on laws allowing public education to be segregated by race. They argued that such segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs were denied relief in the lower courts based on \u003cem\u003ePlessy v. Ferguson\u003c/em\u003e, which held that racially segregated public facilities were legal so long as the facilities for blacks and whites were equal. (This was known as the “separate but equal” doctrine.) \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the segregation of public education based solely on race violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eSeparate but equal educational facilities for racial minorities is inherently unequal, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Supreme Court held that “separate but equal” facilities are inherently unequal and violate the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that the segregation of public education based on race instilled a sense of inferiority that had a hugely detrimental effect on the education and personal growth of African American children. Warren based much of his opinion on information from social science studies rather than court precedent. The decision also used language that was relatively accessible to non-lawyers because Warren felt it was necessary for all Americans to understand its logic. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38936,"name":"Robert L.

Congress gave the new agency the power of eminent domain – the ability to seize private property with just compensation. Berman and the other appellants owned a department store in one blighted area targeted by the commission and objected to the seizing of their property solely for beautification of the area. The landowners brought a civil suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the Act. Their case was dismissed. They then appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the seizing of Berman and the other appellants\u0027 property for the purpose of beautification and redevelopment of the community violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice William O. Douglas, the Court found that the Fifth Amendment does not limit Congress\u0027 power to seize private property with just compensation to any specific purpose.

They also spent three-and-a-half to four nights per week in the fire hall, where they were on-call in case of an alarm; however, they were only paid for time spent actually responding to an alarm. The fire hall was equipped with heated and air-conditioned sleeping quarters, along with the equipment for various recreational activities, such as pool, dominoes, etc. The plaintiffs could sleep or be otherwise engaged during the time they spent in the fire hall as long as they were available should there be an alarm. The plaintiffs sued Swift \u0026amp; Company under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and argued that they should be compensated for the time spent in the fire hall even when not directly answering an alarm. They sought to recover around $77,000 in overtime costs, liquidated damages and attorneys’ fees. The trial court found that the time spent in the fire hall did not constitute work under the FLSA, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the time the plaintiffs spent in the fire hall constitute work under the Fair Labor Standards Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Robert H. Jackson delivered the case for the unanimous Court. The Court held that there was no reason that time spent waiting could not also be time spent working, especially in cases in which the conditions of employment involve waiting time. Although it can be difficult to determine the facts of a case and whether the activity in question constitutes work, Congress granted the courts the authority to do so. In this case, the Court held that the decisions in the lower courts were based on an erroneous understanding of the law that classified waiting time as wholly separate from working time, so the judgment was reversed and the case remanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19655,"name":"Curtis McBroom","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/curtis_mcbroom","view_count":0,"last_name":"McBroom","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"curtis_mcbroom"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21994"},{"advocate":{"ID":18101,"name":"Beverly V.

Glasser, Norton I. Kretske, and Alfred E. Roth were Assistant United States Attorneys in the Northern District of Illinois, specializing in liquor and revenue offenses. They, along with Anthony Horton, a professional bondsman, and Louis Kaplan, an automobile allegedly engaged in illicit alcohol trafficking around Chicago, were found guilty and sentenced for conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to bribery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a joint trial, Glasser was represented by William Scott Stewart and George Callaghan. Kretske was originally represented by the firm “Harrington \u0026amp; McDonnell, but Kretske was dissatisfied with the firm, and the trial judge proposed appointing Stewart to represent Kretske (in addition to Glasser, whom Stewart was already representing). Glasser objected to the appointment, arguing (through Stewart) that that there would be a conflict of interest in representing both defendants. The judge appointed Stewart to represent Kretske over Glasser’s objection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA jury of 11 men and one woman convicted all five defendants of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and the judge denied the defendants’ motion for a new trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seventh Circuit affirmed the convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Does a criminal defense lawyer’s conflict of interest arising from simultaneous representation of co-defendants violate the Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Does the exclusion of women from the jury pool violate the Sixth Amendment guarantee of an impartial jury consisting of a fair cross-section of the community?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003e1. A defense lawyer’s conflict of interest arising from a simultaneous representation of co-defendants violates the Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. The exclusion of women (other than members of the League of Women Voters who had taken a jury training class) from the jury pool violates the Sixth Amendment guarantee of an impartial jury consisting of a fair cross-section of the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion by Justice Frank Murphy, the Court reversed the conviction of Glasser (No. 30) and affirmed the convictions of the other two defendants (Nos. 31 and 32). The assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment requires that such assistance be “untrammeled and unimpaired” by a court order appointing one lawyer to represent multiple defendants, despite conflicting interests. Not only did Stewart have conflicting interests, but those conflicts prejudiced Glasser. The Court declined to calculate exactly the degree of prejudice to Glasser by the conflict of interest but described such a calculus as “at once difficult and unnecessary.” The Court concluded that neither Kretske and Rother were prejudiced, so it declined to reverse their convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court further held that in the selection of federal juries, the understandable desire for competent jurors should not lead to the result of a jury that is not a fair cross-section of the community. Thus, the exclusion of women, except those members of the League of Women Voters who had taken a jury training class, violated the defendants’ Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury consisting of a fair cross-section of the community. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter filed a dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice Harlan Stone joined. Frankfurter argued that Glasser, by remaining silent, had acquiesced to the appointment and waived his right to appeal by not objecting. Moreover, he argued that the joint representation benefited Glasser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Robert Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26665,"name":"Homer Cummings","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/homer_cummings","view_count":0,"last_name":"Cummings","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"homer_cummings"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner in No. 30","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22782"},{"advocate":{"ID":40509,"name":"Ralph M.
