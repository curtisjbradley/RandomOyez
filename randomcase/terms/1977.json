Stump. Judge Stump concluded sterilization was in Sparkman’s best interests due to her mental capabilities and approved the petition. The operation was performed, although Sparkman was unaware of the true nature of the surgery. Two years later, after Sparkman married, she discovered that the sterilization explained her inability to become pregnant. Sparkman sued Judge Stump for violating her right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court held that although the approval of the petition by Judge Stump was erroneous, he had jurisdiction to consider the petition and was entitled to judicial immunity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment and concluded that Judge Stump did not have jurisdiction to approve the petition and that he did not have judicial immunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a district court judge have the power to entertain and act upon the petition for sterilization, which makes him immune from damages liability even if his approval of the petition was in error?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 5-3 majority. The Court held that the law vested the district court judge with the power to entertain and act upon the petition for sterilization, and he is therefore immune from damages liability even if his approval of the petition was in error. The Court held that a judge could only be deprived of immunity when he acted in clear absence of jurisdiction. In this case, the court had general jurisdiction over the petition for sterilization, therefore, Judge Stump’s approval was a judicial act, and he was immunized from liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent, in which he argued that the scope of judicial immunity was a limited liability for judicial acts. Because approval of a petition for sterilization is not a function normally performed by a judge, it is not a judicial act. In a separate dissent, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. argued that a judicial officer acted in a manner that precluded all resort to appellate or other judicial remedies and that the judge should not be entitled to immunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan Jr. did not participate in the discussion or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25272,"name":"George E.

The Attorney General of Massachusetts informed the organizations that he intended to enforce a state statute that prohibited such organizations from making contributions to influence the outcome of a vote that does not materially affect their assets and holdings. The organizations sued and argued that the statute violated their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the constitutionality of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment protect the rights of corporations to attempt to influence the outcome of elections in which they have no direct monetary interest?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the right to attempt to influence the outcomes of elections is one of the primary rights the First Amendment was meant to protect. If this form of speech came from a person rather than a corporation, there would be no question about whether it was protected speech. The Court also held that its previous decisions regarding the First Amendment rights of corporations emphasized the role that such speech played in creating public discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that the Massachusetts risked stifling the speech of organizations who use the corporate form to ensure mass communication with the public. He also argued that the statute could easily interfere with the First Amendment protection of the freedom of speech, since many newspapers and other news sources are part of large media conglomerations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that the majority’s opinion vastly underestimates the importance of state regulation of competing First Amendment interests, especially given the disproportionate economic power of corporations.  Since corporations are funded by the money of investors, Justice White argued that it was the state’s duty to ensure that shareholder money was being used for its primary purpose: to make money, not pursue unrelated political objectives. The statute ensured that shareholders’ money is not funding political initiatives they would not individually support. He pointed out that the statute did not prevent the individuals who make up the corporations from communicating their views to the public on an individual basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William H. Rehnquist argued that corporations are, and had always been, considered artificial persons under the law, and therefore not granted the rights of natural persons. Since the right of political expression is not necessary for a corporation to function economically and could be detrimental to the overall political sphere, he argued that the statute was justified.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23943,"name":"Francis H.

She received no compensation for her work with ACLU. In her capacity as a lawyer at the private firm, Primus discovered women were being sterilized. Primus spoke to a group of the sterilized women to advise them of their legal rights and suggested the possibility of a lawsuit. One of these women, Mary Etta Williams, decided she wanted to sue her doctor over her sterilization. Primus then informed Williams through a letter of the ACLU’s offer of free legal representation. Shortly after, Williams visited the doctor who sterilized her, signed a release of liability, and notified Primus she no longer intended to sue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few months later, the Secretary of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of South Carolina (Board) filed a complaint that charged Primus with solicitation in violation of the Canons of Ethics, a code of professional conduct for lawyers. The Supreme Court of South Carolina, in accordance with the Board’s panel recommendation, found Primus in violation of regulations regarding solicitation. Primus appealed and argued that the disciplinary action violated the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a state punish an attorney who advises someone of her legal rights and discloses that free legal assistance is available from a non-profit organization with which the attorney is affiliated?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 7-1 majority. The Court held that South Carolina’s application of disciplinary action for the attorney’s solicitation activity violated the First Amendment’s protection of political expression and association as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, Primus’ actions were an expression of the political beliefs and civil liberty objectives of the ACLU, rather than actions personal financial gain. Therefore, reaching out to the sterilization victim was not a misrepresentation or invasion of privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the states should decide which lawyers shall be admitted to or released from the Bar, and that the disciplinary action in this case does not violate the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39968,"name":"Ray P.

Later, Officer Headricks knocked on the door of Mincey\u0027s apartment, accompanied by nine other plainclothes officers. Mincey’s acquaintance, John Hodgman, opened the door. Officer Headricks slipped inside and quickly went to the bedroom. As the other officers entered the apartment -- despite Hodgman’s attempts to stop them -- the sound of gunfire came from the bedroom. Officer Headricks emerged from the bedroom and collapsed on the floor; he died a few hours later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other officers found Mincey lying on the floor of his bedroom, wounded and semiconscious, then quickly searched the apartment for other injured persons. Mincey suffered damage to his sciatic nerve and partial paralysis of his right leg; a doctor described him as depressed almost to the point of being comatose. A detective interrogated him for several hours at the hospital, ignoring Mincey’s repeated requests for counsel. In addition, soon after the shooting, two homicide detectives arrived at the apartment and took charge of the investigation. Their search lasted for four days, during which officers searched, photographed and diagrammed the entire apartment. They did not, however, obtain a warrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state charged Mincey with murder, assault, and three counts of narcotics offenses. Much of the prosecution’s evidence was the product of the extensive search of Mincey’s apartment. Mincey contended at trial that this evidence was unconstitutionally taken without a warrant and that his statements were inadmissible because they were not made voluntarily. In a preliminary hearing, the court found that Mincey made the statements voluntarily. Mincey’s motion to suppress evidence taken from his apartment was also denied, and he was convicted on all charges. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that the warrantless search of Mincey’s apartment was constitutional because it was a search of a murder scene, and that Mincey’s statements were admissible for impeachment purposes, reversing the murder and assault charges on other grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did the admission of evidence taken during a four-day long warrantless search of Mincey’s residence constitute an unreasonable search or seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the admission of Mincey’s responses to police questioning made while he was a patient in the intensive care unit of a hospital violate his privilege against self-incrimination, rights to counsel and due process under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. In an 8-1 opinion written by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court held that the extensive, warrantless search of Mincey’s apartment was unreasonable and unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Justice Stewart wrote that warrantless searches were \u003ci\u003eper se\u003c/i\u003e unreasonable with a few specific exceptions, and rejected Arizona’s argument that the search of a homicide scene was one of these exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart rejected Arizona’s contention that Mincey forfeited his right to privacy in his home by shooting Officer Headricks. He pointed out that this argument assumed Mincey’s guilt, also writing that the fact of Mincey’s arrest did not remove his right to privacy in his home. Justice Stewart also rejected Arizona’s argument that the search of the homicide scene was justified by emergency circumstances or by vital public interest in prompt investigation of the scene. He wrote that there were no exigent circumstances allowing the search, and held that the seriousness of the alleged crime did not create those circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart also held that Mincey’s statements were inadmissible because they were not made voluntarily. He looked to the circumstances, focusing on Mincey’s physical state during Detective Hust’s interrogation. Mincey was in the intensive care unit, barely conscious, heavily encumbered by medical equipment, and completely at Detective Hust’s mercy. Justice Stewart also focused on Mincey’s repeated statements that he did not want to speak without a lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall concurred, joined by Justice William Brennan. Justice Marshall emphasized the practical difficulties created by denying petitioners a federal habeas remedy for Fourth Amendment violations arising out of state criminal convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Rehnquist concurred in part and dissented in part.

During plea negotiations, the prosecutor offered to pursue a five year sentence if Hayes would plead guilty. However, the prosecutor also stated that he would seek an indictment under the Kentucky Habitual Crime Act if the defendant did not register this plea. (Hayes had two prior felony convictions on his record.) If found guilty under this law, Hayes would be imprisoned for life. Hayes did not plead guilty and the prosecutor followed through on his promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause prohibit state prosecutors from carrying out a threat made during plea negotiations to re-indict the accused on more serious charges if he does not plead guilty to the offense with which he was originally charged?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court held that the defendant\u0027s due process rights were not violated in this case. Justice Stewart spent some time describing the important role that plea bargaining plays in the nation\u0027s legal system, a role that has been accepted by the Supreme Court in cases such as Blackledge v. Allison (1977) and Brady v. United States (1970). This acceptance, in turn, implies that the prosecutor has a legitimate interest in persuading a defendant to relinquish his or her right to plead not guilty.

The employers required pregnant women to take unpaid leaves of absence before there was any medical reason to do so. The plaintiffs sought an injunction against the forced leaves of absence in the future, as well as back pay for those that had already occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court found that such policies were unconstitutional but held that the city had immunity from paying the back wages. The district court also held that the motion for an injunction was moot because the organizations removed the policy in the intervening time. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIf sued in their official capacity, are local government officials and organizations such as a school board considered “persons” for the purpose of liability for back wages?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and specifically the Sherman Amendment, indicated that municipalities could be liable for the infringement of constitutional rights. Additionally, by 1871 there was a clear legislative and precedent-based history for municipal corporations — such as a school board — to be considered a “person” for the purpose of lawsuits and liability. The Court held that this liability only existed when the constitutional infringement was the direct result of an official policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote that the Court’s decision to overrule \u003ci\u003eMonroe v. Pape\u003c/i\u003e was an unusual but crucial one. The Court was able to rely on the precedents that established the liability of school boards for suits dealing with civil rights issues such as segregation. Given these precedents, the decision in this case allowed the Court to correct an error and create a more consistent stance on municipal liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred in the sections of the Court’s opinion that explain the decision and not in those that serve purely as background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that there were too many precedents that supported the immunity of municipalities to summarily dismiss with this decision. Since this decision represents such a huge departure from the previous understanding of municipal immunity under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the Court should require evidence “beyond doubt” that the previous decision was incorrect. The majority based its decision primarily on the debate surrounding a rejected amendment to the Act, which he argued is not strong enough evidence to overrule \u003ci\u003eMonroe v. Pape\u003c/i\u003e. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37419,"name":"Oscar Chase","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/oscar_chase","view_count":0,"last_name":"Chase","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"oscar_chase"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10755"},{"advocate":{"ID":35060,"name":"L.

After asking Mimms to exit the car, the officers noticed an unusual bulge underneath his jacket. One of the officers searched Mimms and discovered a loaded .38-caliber revolver. Mimms was charged with carrying a concealed deadly weapon and unlawfully carrying a firearm without a license. He was convicted on both counts at trial after his motion to suppress the revolver was denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that the officers\u0027 request for Mimms to exit the vehicle was an unlawful \"seizure\" in violation of the Fourth Amendment. According to the court, the officer could not point to any \"objective observable facts to support a suspicion that criminal activity was afoot or that the occupants of the vehicle posed a threat to police safety\" sufficient to warrant ordering Mimms to step out of the car. Therefore, the officers should never have noticed the bulge and the search should never have taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo police officers violate the Fourth Amendment\u0027s prohibition against unlawful searches and seizures when, during a routine traffic stop, they obtain evidence through a search conducted after asking the suspect to exit the vehicle without a justifiable reason to do so?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 per curiam decision, the Court held that the search did not violate Mimms\u0027 rights under the Fourth Amendment. The Court noted that the officers had already detained Mimms in order to issue him a traffic summons and felt that asking him to exit the vehicle was a minimal and reasonable intrusion of his freedom. Whether the search occurred inside or outside the car was irrelevant to the Court: the officers had stopped Mimms for a legitimate reason and, upon observing the bulge in his jacket, any person of reasonable caution would have conducted the search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that such searches, in order to conform to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, must relate to the reason for the stop. Because the officers had detained Mimms for an expired license plate, searching him for concealed weapons was not within the scope of the stop and therefore made it an unlawful search. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, filed a separate dissent arguing that the majority opinion gave too much discretion to police officers, allowing them to search detainees whenever they could invent any basis for concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"434","page":"106","year":"1977","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/15662"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15043,"name":"Potter Stewart","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/potter_stewart","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stewart","roles":[{"id":2687,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-353962800,"date_end":362984400,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

The principal saw a pack of the cigarettes change hands and believed he smelled marijuana. When the principal approached, the students immediately discarded the cigarette. The students were suspended for the customary 20 days for violation of the school drug policy, despite their protests that they had not been smoking marijuana. A few days later, Piphus, his mother and sister, school officials, and representatives from a legal aid clinic met to discuss the suspension, not to determine whether or not Piphus had violated the school drug policy. Piphus and his mother sued the school official in federal district court for violating Piphus’ Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as $3000 in damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn September 11, 1973, Silas Brisco, a sixth grader at Clara Barton Elementary School in Chicago, received a 20-day suspension for wearing an earring to school in violation of school policy. The previous year, the school principal had enacted a policy banning earrings, as he believed they were associated with gang affiliation. When asked to remove the earring, Brisco refused and stated it was a symbol of black pride. Brisco and his mother sued the school officials in federal district court for violating Brisco’s right to due process. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief and $5000 in damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two cases were consolidated for trial and the district court held that their suspensions violated the Fourteenth Amendment and that the schools were not entitled to immunity, but the court did not award damages. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded for the district court to reconsider questions of relief and damages. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn cases dealing with the denial of due process, must a plaintiff prove that he was actually injured by the deprivation in order to recover substantial nonpunitive damages?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell delivered the opinion of the 8-0 majority. The Court held that the purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 is to compensate people for injuries caused by the deprivation of civil rights, which means that compensation cannot occur without proof of injury. However, the definition of injury must be adapted to fit the civil rights in question. The Court held that due process could cause distress even when conducted properly, so there must be evidence of an actual injury to justify compensation. The Court also held that proof of actual injury was not required to award nominal damages not to exceed one dollar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall concurred in the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A.

These union members undertook no writing functions, as the writing contract was the basis for the strike. The union charged those members for violating several strike rules for crossing the picket line, issued threats to get them to stop working and imposed hefty penalties. The National Labor Relations Board (Board) found that the National Labor Relations Act (Act) protected the actions of the union members and that the union violated the Act by disciplining members. The Board ordered the union to cease and desist its actions against said members. The Administrative Law Judge held that unions cannot discipline a representative responsible for collective-bargaining or grievance-adjustment during a strike. Respondents applied to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for review, and the Board applied to enforce its order. The Court of Appeals reversed the Board’s ruling that only supervisory tasks were undertaken and denied enforcement of the Board’s order.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a labor union violate the National Labor Relations Act when it disciplines its members for crossing the picket line to perform collective-bargaining and grievance-adjustment tasks during a strike?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, if the sanctions imposed may adversely affect the supervisor’s performance of his collective-bargaining or grievance-adjustment tasks and coerce or restrain the employer. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Supreme Court held that the Act may intrude upon the union’s right to resort to sanctions to effectuate a strike, but it provides for a level playing field for both negotiators during a strike..The Court also held that no writing-related work was undertaken, so the union had violated the Act by disciplining the union members in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent in which he argued that barring a union from imposing sanctions against members weakens a collective strike and upsets the balance between labor and management in management’s favor. Therefore, the majority’s opinion is inconsistent with the structure of the Act. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37058,"name":"Norton J.

The building was leased to Loren Tyler, who ran the business with Robert Tompkins. When Fire Chief See arrived on the scene, he was informed that two plastic containers of flammable liquid were found in the building. After determining that arson possibly caused the fire, See called Police Detective Webb. Webb arrived and took pictures, but the smoke and steam forced him to postpone his investigation. Around 4 a.m., the fire was extinguished and the personnel left the premises. The containers were turned over to Webb. Webb did not have a warrant for any of the entries into the building or the removal of the containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, See returned to the scene with Assistant Chief Somerville, whose job was to determine the “origin of all fires that occur in the Township.” They conducted a cursory examination and left. An hour later, Somerville returned with Webb, and the two discovered evidence of arson. The men did not have warrants for these entrances or seizures of evidence. Over the course of multiple visits beginning on February 16, Sergeant Hoffman of the Michigan State Police Arson Section conducted an investigation and secured further evidence of arson that played an important role in the trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, the respondents objected to the introduction of this evidence, but the judge admitted it, and they were convicted. The Court of Appeals of the State of Michigan held that the constitutional protections against illegal searches and seizures did not pertain to arson investigations of burned premises and affirmed the conviction. The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the illegal searches and seizures had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court reversed the convictions and ordered a new trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment protection against illegal searches and seizures extend to investigations of burned premises for evidence of arson?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 7-1 majority. The Court held that any search for administrative purposes, such as to find evidence of a crime, requires a warrant.  There are circumstances that require law enforcement agents to act without a warrant, such as when firemen enter a burning building. Once in the building for that purpose, the firemen may seize evidence of arson that is in plain view without obtaining a warrant. The Court also held that determining the cause of the fire is part of a fireman’s job, so firemen may remain in a building without a warrant after a fire has been extinguished for “a reasonable amount of time” to investigate. The Court held that the initial entry and the investigation on the following morning were constitutional, but the subsequent entries and seizures of evidence were not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He agreed with the Court’s finding that the entries of February 16 and beyond were illegal searches, but disagreed with the Court on the meaning of the Warrant Clause. He argued that a warrant is necessary when there is probable cause and the search must be unannounced to be effective. If there is no reason for such a confrontation, the Warrant Clause requires that the property owner be given fair warning of the search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Byron R. White wrote that the Court applied the “reasonable amount of time” criterion too broadly in this case. He argued that there was no reason to consider the reentry of the premises the following morning a continuation of the original warrantless entry. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that reasonable searches of commercial premises do not require a warrant. The record showed that Tyler did not object to the searches as they were occurring, and therefore obviously considered them reasonable. Since Tyler no longer used the building after the fire, providing him fair notice would not have served a purpose either. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29315,"name":"Jeffrey Butler","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jeffrey_butler","view_count":0,"last_name":"Butler","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jeffrey_butler"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner, pro hac vice, by special leave of Court","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10797"},{"advocate":{"ID":28994,"name":"Jesse R.

On appeal from an adverse district court finding of absolute immunity for state officials, the New York Court of Appeals reversed as it found that federal administrators were only entitled to qualified immunity. Butz appealed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre federal administrators entitled to absolute or qualified immunity in the face of challenges to their conduct of public business?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 4-to-5 opinion, the Court began by noting that absent exceptional circumstances federal executive officials are only entitled to qualified immunity, since such officials must abide by constitutional and statutory scope-of-power limitations. Federal officials who perform adjudicatory, or other similar prosecutorial functions, cannot, however, be held liable for mere \"good faith\" judgment errors. The Court reasoned that the risk of making unconstitutional determinations is outweighed by the need to preserve independent judgement, through grants of absolute immunity to judges and other similarly situated decision makers. The Court concluded that the similarity between the type of decision-making required of federal prosecutors and other administrative agents is sufficiently strong to warrant an extension of absolute immunity to the latter for decisions made in the course of their official conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20628,"name":"David C.

In response, Maryland passed a statute prohibiting oil producers or refiners from operating gasoline stations within the state and requiring producers and refiners extend temporary price cuts to the stations they supplied. Exxon challenged the statute in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, which ruled the statute invalid. The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed the ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does Maryland\u0027s statute violate the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does Maryland\u0027s statute conflict with the Robinson-Patman Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a 7-1 decision, the Court affirmed the Maryland Court of Appeals. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens cited \u003cem\u003eFerguson v. Skrupa\u003c/em\u003e establishing that the purpose of the judiciary is not to \"weigh the wisdom of legislation,\" and therefore did not concern due process. Additionally, since all gasoline sold in Maryland came from out-of-state refineries, Maryland\u0027s statute did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The court acknowledged that while the price-cut provision conflicted with the purposes of the Robinson-Patman and Sherman Acts, the hypothetical situations of price discrimination presented were \"speculative\" and insufficient to invalidate the act. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Lewis F.

The Court found that a trial by jury of less than six members violated the accused\u0027s right to a trial by jury as protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Justice Blackmun reasoned that small juries foster poor group deliberation. Group memory of the details of testimony, the ease with which group compromises can be made, and the desire of the group to be self-critical and reflective are all hindered as the size of the jury decreases. Blackmun also relied on statistical studies to claim that the risk of jury error increased with smaller juries.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35601,"name":"Michael Clutter","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/michael_clutter","view_count":0,"last_name":"Clutter","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"michael_clutter"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner, pro hac vice by special leave of Court","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10821"},{"advocate":{"ID":35001,"name":"Leonard W.

In 1973 Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which protected certain species classified as “endangered”.  The Secretary of the Interior declared the Snail Darter endangered.  The area of the Tellico Dam was its “critical habitat”.  Although the multi-million dollar project was almost completed, the project predated the ESA, and Congress continued to appropriate funds to the project after the ESA passed, Hiram Hill sued to enjoin the completion of the Dam in order to protect the Snail Darter.  He argued that completing and opening the dam would violate the ESA by causing the extinction of the snail darter.  The district court refused to grant the injunction and dismissed the complaint.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to issue a permanent injunction against any activities that would modify or destroy the Snail Darter’s critical habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the ESA prohibit completion of the Tellico Dam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Is the Snail Darter protected by the Endangered Species Act, even though congress continued to fund the dam project and stated that it should be completed?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, Yes.  In a 6-3 decision, Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote the majority opinion affirming the injunction.  The Supreme Court held that Congress’ continued appropriation of funds did not imply that the Dam project was exempt from the ESA.  The operation of the Tellico Dam would wipe out the Snail Darter\u0027s habitat, so an injunction was the proper remedy.  Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a dissent, stating that the ESA does not apply to any project that is completed or substantially completed when the threat to the endangered species arose.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.  Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissent, arguing that the ESA did not prohibit the district court from refusing to grant an injunction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24942,"name":"Griffin B.

The state of Massachusetts owned and utilized a helicopter for the purpose of patrolling highways and fulfilling other police duties. When Massachusetts refused to pay the tax, the federal government collected it from the state\u0027s accounts, plus interest and penalties.

The Council of Evaluation (Council), a faculty-student body that recommends various actions including probation and dismissal, recommended Horowitz only advanceto her last year on a probationary status. In the middle of the following academic year, the Council concluded that Horowitz should not be considered for graduation at the end of the year and would be dropped as a student unless the Council saw a radical improvement. Horowitz failed to show improvement, her surgery rotations rated “low satisfactory,” and the Council recommended dismissal from the university. A committee composed solely of faculty members and the Dean, the final decision-makers, approved the decision. Horowitz sued and claimed that the procedure leading to her dismissal violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court concluded that Horowitz had been afforded all the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the decision by holding that Horowitz had not been afforded procedural due process prior.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an academic dismissal from a university without a hearing before the school’s decision-making body violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The court held that the procedures leading to the Horowitz’s dismissal for academic deficiencies did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Horowitz was fully informed of the faculty dissatisfaction with her clinical progress and the threat of postponing her graduation and continued enrollment. The Court held that a hearing before the school’s decision-making body is not required for dismissals for academic deficiencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a concurring opinion in which he added that Horowitz was dismissed for academic deficiencies rather than for disciplinary reasons, and that in these circumstances she was accorded due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he argued that the various meetings about Horowitz’s academic performance met the standards of procedural due process. However, the procedure of dismissal for academic reasons, rather than disciplinary reasons was arbitrary. In his separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, with whom Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined, wrote that Horowitz received the procedural process due under the Fourteenth Amendment, but that the Court should not decide what the further appropriate procedures are required in graduate school dismissals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36892,"name":"Marvin E.

These factors included any aspect of a defendant\u0027s character or record and any circumstances of the offense proffered as a reason for a sentence less than death.

An employee distributing a pro-union newsletter in the employee cafeteria was informed that she had violated the rule and was warned of possible dismissal if she continued. The union filed a claim against the hospital under the National Labor Relations Act, which in 1974 was extended to employees of nonprofit healthcare institutions. After a hearing before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the Administrative Law Judge, who resolves disputes between government agencies and persons affected by the decision of the agencies, held that the hospital cannot interfere with the employees\u0027 rights and must rescind its written rule prohibiting distribution of union literature and union solicitation in its cafeteria and coffee shop. The hospital appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which affirmed the part of the lower court\u0027s ruling that called for rescinding the rule that excluded union activity in eating facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit correct in upholding the part of the National Labor Relations Board\u0027s order that barred the hospital from enforcing its rule that prohibited employees from distributing union literature and soliciting support in eating facilities?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that, since 1974, the Act provided employees of nonprofit healthcare institutions with the right to self-organize and bargain collectively, including the right to communicate about the topic at the jobsite. However, an employer may curb that right by showing that special circumstances necessitate the prohibition of communication in order to maintain production or discipline. In this case, the Court held that the communication and organizing in the cafeteria and the coffee shop did not interfere with patient care sufficiently to justify enforcement of the hospital\u0027s rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote that the Board\u0027s broad order may not fully appreciate the delicate nature of a hospital\u0027s communal space and the patients\u0027 need to recover in a stress-free environment. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Lewis F. Powell joined in the concurrence. In his separate concurrence, Justice Powell criticized the Board\u0027s use of the precedent case, \u003cem\u003eRepublic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB\u003c/em\u003e, in reaching its decision. He asserted that Republic\u0027s holding that solicitation during work hours were presumptively invalid was inapplicable in the context of this case given the distinct nature of a hospital as a recovery place and also that the employees lacked meeting space within the hospital. Chief Justice Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38988,"name":"Robert Chandler","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/robert_chandler","view_count":0,"last_name":"Chandler","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"robert_chandler"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10865"},{"advocate":{"ID":34498,"name":"Laurence Stephen Gold","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/laurence_gold","view_count":0,"last_name":"Gold","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"laurence_gold"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the intervener Union","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10866"},{"advocate":{"ID":34309,"name":"Louis Chandler","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/louis_chandler","view_count":0,"last_name":"Chandler","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"louis_chandler"},"advocate_description":"","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10867"},{"advocate":{"ID":37058,"name":"Norton J.

In evaluating the diet and sleeping arrangements of the inmates, the physical condition of cells, and the behavior of prison guards (some of whom were inmates who had been issued guns), a District Court called the conditions which inmates were forced to face \"a dark and evil world completely alien to the free world.\" This case involved a challenge to the practice of \"punitive isolation\" in Arkansas prisons which was often done for indiscriminate periods of time in crowded windowless cells.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid punitive isolation for more than thirty days in the Arkansas prison system constitute cruel and unusual punishment as prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that punitive isolation for longer than thirty days in Arkansas prisons constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated the Constitution. Justice Stevens conceded that isolation in and of itself was not necessarily unconstitutional and may in fact serve an important, legitimate interest in administering a prison. However, when taken as a whole, continued Stevens, the conditions in Arkansas\u0027s prisons, combined with the severe risks to an inmate\u0027s health and safety which accompanied confinement in isolation, did constitute cruel and unusual punishment. \"A filthy, overcrowded cell and a diet of \u0027gruel\u0027 might be tolerated for a few days and be intolerably cruel for weeks or months,\" Stevens concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38069,"name":"Philip E.

Flook applied for a patent on a method of adjusting alarm limits in response to changes that occur during the catalytic conversion process.. Because the only novel feature of the method was a mathematical formula, the patent examiner determined that the method did not amount to a discovery eligible for patent protection and rejected the application. The Board of Appeals for the Patent and Trademark Office sustained the rejection. On appeal, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed and held that the limited application of the method did not “wholly pre-empt” the formula from the public domain, and therefore it was eligible for patent protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the identification of a limited category of useful applications of a mathematical formula, such as its use in catalytic conversion processes, render a method based on such a formula-eligible for patent protection?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that, absent some other novel or inventive concept in the individual’s application for a patent, activity that results from the solution of a formula or algorithm cannot transform the formula from an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent in which he argued that the method for updating alarm limits did not lose its eligibility for patent protection merely because one step in the method was not patentable. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35240,"name":"Lawrence G.

In 1977, Paul A. McDaniel, a Baptist minister, filed as a candidate for the state constitutional convention. Another candidate, Selma Cash Paty, sued for a declaratory judgment that McDaniel was disqualified. The Chancery Court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. McDaniel’s name remained on the ballot and he was elected. After the election, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Chancery Court and held that the statute did not restrict any expression of religious belief. The court held that the state interest in maintaining the separation of church and state was sufficient to justify the restrictions of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Tennessee statute barring “Minister[s] of the Gospel or priest[s] of any denomination whatever” from serving as legislators violate the free exercise of religion guaranteed through the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court. The Court held that the statute made the ability to exercise civil rights conditional on the surrender of religious rights and therefore violated the First Amendment protection of the free exercise of religion as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the Court hesitated to strike down a statute that had such a long and vital national history, Tennessee could not prove that clergy participation was dangerous to the modern political processes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. concurred in the judgment. He argued that the Tennessee statute essentially established a test of religious conviction in order to be eligible for office that disqualified anyone with a strong enough belief to join the clergy. Government imposition of the burden to choose between one’s religious beliefs and the desire to seek office is an unconstitutional restriction on the free exercise of religion. He argued that the Establishment Clause does not give the government the power to discriminate against religious persons seeking or holding office. Justice Marshall joined in the opinion concurring in judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice Potter Stewart separately concurred in the judgment, and wrote that this case was covered by the ruling in \u003ci\u003eTorcaso v. Watkins\u003c/i\u003e, where the Court held that states may not condition public office on any type of religious belief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment. He argued that, rather than violating the First Amendment protection of the free exercise of religion, the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the statute is specific to ministers, it implies that ministers are less able to keep outside interests from interfering with their governmental service than anyone else. Tennessee was not able to prove the necessity of this restriction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24238,"name":"Frederic S.

The officers searched The Daily\u0027s photographic laboratories, filing cabinets, desks, and waste paper baskets, but no materials were removed from the office.

Unbeknownst to her, the phone call in which she made the threat was recorded. The Federal Bureau of Investigations contacted Jacobs and informed of her Miranda rights during questioning about the incident. About nine months later, Jacobs was called before a grand jury via a subpoena regarding the threatening statements she had previously made. She did not have an attorney present, but she was read her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.

The city marshal arranged for Flagg Bros., Inc. to store the Brooks\u0027 furniture in their warehouse, and informed Ms. Brooks of the cost. Although she objected, she allowed the workers to remove her furniture to the warehouse. On August 25, 1973, after a series of disputes about the charges, Ms. Brooks received a letter from Flagg Bros., Inc. informing her that her furniture would be sold if she did not settle her account within 10 days. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Brooks initiated a class action in district court and alleged that such a sale as allowed by a New York statute would violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The American Warehousemen’s Association, the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses, and the Attorney General of New York intervened as defendants to defend the statute in question. The district court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a New York state statute that allows storage companies to sell stored goods if they do not receive payment violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 5-3 majority. The Court held that the decision of the storage facility to sell the goods could not be considered a state action, and therefore did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. To show that they had a claim worthy of relief, the respondents must have given evidence that they were denied a right guaranteed by the Constitution, and that Flagg Bros., Inc. was operating as the State of New York. The Court held that there was no deprivation of a Constitutional right, as the Constitution only protects against state seizure of property, not that of private actors. The Court also held that the statute that allows the sale to happen does not imply any state action, so Flagg Bros., Inc. was not acting on behalf of the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent and argued that the statute allowed for unconstitutional discrimination against the poor, who were unable to pay the required fee in order to prevent the sale of their belongings. He also argued that the Court’s determination ignored the realities of the state’s role in eviction and subsequent legal procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that the company’s right to conduct the sale derived from the state, and not the original property owners, so the sale must be held to the standards of the Fourteenth Amendment. He argued that state authorization of a “nonconsensual resolution of conflict between debtor and creditor” is the type of action that the Due Process Clause was meant to prevent. Justice Byron R. White and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. did not take part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15397,"name":"Alvin Altman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/alvin_altman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Altman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"alvin_altman"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners in 77-25","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10950"},{"advocate":{"ID":16011,"name":"A.

This law affected Allied Structural Steel as the company began closing offices in Minnesota. Even though the employees affected by the closing were not entitled to pensions under the terms of their employment with the company, according to the Minnesota law, they were. The company was ordered to pay approximately $185,000 to comply with the statute\u0027s provisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Minnesota\u0027s Private Pension Benefits Protection Act violate the Contract Clause of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that the Minnesota law did violate the Constitution as it \"substantially altered\" the provisions of pension agreements which Allied Steel had with its employees. Citing the importance that the Framers placed on private contracts in the conduct of business, Justice Stewart found that the act\u0027s effect was \"severe\" as it nullified terms of t he company\u0027s obligations to its employees and imposed an \"unexpected liability in potentially disabling amounts.\" Furthermore, the law was narrowly targeted at employers who had decided to establish employee pension plans, and it did not seek to deal with broad economic and social problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25141,"name":"George B.

The two female employees were raped. The ensuing police investigation resulted in the arrest of the Winston Holloway, Ray Lee Welch, and Gary Don Campbell. On July 29, 1975, the three defendants were each charged with one count of robbery and two counts of rape. On August 5, the trial court appointed Harold Hall to serve as counsel for all three defendants, and the date was set for their consolidated trial. Prior to the trial, Hall moved for the court to appoint separate counsel for each defendant because he felt, based on information from the defendants, that there would be a conflict of interest in representing their cases together. The trial court declined to appoint separate counsel. Hall renewed the motion before the jury was empaneled, and the court again denied it. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes requiring a single attorney to represent multiple defendants deprive the defendants of their Sixth Amendment right to adequate assistance of counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that a single lawyer representing multiple defendants does not automatically deprive the defendants of their rights, but it does if there is a conflict of interest. Because Hall showed that a conflict of interest was present, the trial court should have taken steps to appoint separate counsel or ensured that the risk of conflict was not great enough to require such action. The trial court did neither, so the defendants were deprived of their Sixth Amendment rights. The Court also held that, in such situations, the reversal of the conviction is automatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. argued that the trial court’s failure to investigate the defense counsel’s claim that the interests of his clients conflict does not rise to level of a constitutional violation requiring reversal of the verdict. He argued that the majority’s opinion is based on the assumption that the jury will be prejudiced rather than on any evidence of a conflict. Justice Harry A. Blackmun and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27296,"name":"Harold L.

He was rejected both times. The school reserved sixteen places in each entering class of one hundred for \"qualified\" minorities, as part of the university\u0027s affirmative action program, in an effort to redress longstanding, unfair minority exclusions from the medical profession. Bakke\u0027s qualifications (college GPA and test scores) exceeded those of any of the minority students admitted in the two years Bakke\u0027s applications were rejected. Bakke contended, first in the California courts, then in the Supreme Court, that he was excluded from admission solely on the basis of race.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the University of California violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s equal protection clause, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, by practicing an affirmative action policy that resulted in the repeated rejection of Bakke\u0027s application for admission to its medical school?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and yes. There was no single majority opinion. Four of the justices contended that any racial quota system supported by government violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., agreed, casting the deciding vote ordering the medical school to admit Bakke. However, in his opinion, Powell argued that the rigid use of racial quotas as employed at the school violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The remaining four justices held that the use of race as a criterion in admissions decisions in higher education was constitutionally permissible. Powell joined that opinion as well, contending that the use of race was permissible as one of several admission criteria. So, the Court managed to minimize white opposition to the goal of equality (by finding for Bakke) while extending gains for racial minorities through affirmative action.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38990,"name":"Reynold H.

The department determined that, because women live longer than men, the women cost the company more in retirement benefits than the men and so must pay more into the plan. Since the employee contribution was taken directly out of the employee’s paycheck, the female employees brought home less than the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women sued the company for violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and sought an injunction against future payments as well as restitution for the past contributions. While this action was pending in district court, the California legislature passed a law prohibiting companies from forcing women to contribute to the retirement fund more than men. The department changed its payment plan effective January 1, 1975. The district court, however, found that the original plan violated the Civil Rights Act and ordered a refund for the excess payment. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a policy that requires women to make larger contributions to a company’s pension plan than men because women tend to live longer violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs the company liable for the amount of the excess payment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the 6-2 majority. The Court held that the company’s policy was based on aggregate numbers that are not necessarily true for individuals, which violates the Civil Rights Act prohibition of individual discrimination based purely on gender. Although the department argued that that the policy was based on longevity rather than gender, the Court held that many different factors influence longevity and the payment differential was solely gender-based. The Court held that the department was not liable for back pay because the potential that such a holding would influence other companies to change their policies did not offset the potential negative impact on the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In his opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote that the decision of the majority departed from the precedents set by \u003ci\u003eGeduldig v. Aiello\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eGeneral Electric Co. v. Gilbert\u003c/i\u003e without sufficient reasoning. He concurred in the part of the majority’s decision that held the department not liable for back pay. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred in part and dissented in part. He argued that Congress did not intend the Civil Rights Act to impede a business’ ability to create policies based on statistically sound longevity data. Since any individual woman is statistically likely to live longer than any individual man, the policy did not discriminate against individuals solely on the basis of sex but rather based on the likelihood of longevity. He concurred in the majority’s decision that held the department not liable for back pay. Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall concurred in part and dissented in part. He concurred in the majority’s decision that held that the department’s policy violated the Civil Rights Act, but he argued that the department should be held liable for back pay. The district court held the department liable, and the majority’s decision did not find any flaws in the district court’s reasoning. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21318,"name":"David J.

(CJL) allegedly distributed false and misleading press releases regarding its business activities. In response, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exercised its authority ostensibly under § 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, suspending the trading of securities of the company for 10 days. The SEC exercised this authority repeatedly, resulting in suspension of the trading of the stock of CJL for over a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamuel H. Sloan owned 13 shares of CJL and was engaged in \"substantial\" purchases and short sales of the stock when it was suspended. He filed a lawsuit against the SEC alleging, among other claims, that it exceeded its authority under § 12(k) to issue consecutive suspension orders. Notably, Sloan represented himself in the courts below, as well as before the US Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIs a challenge to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its exercise of the authority to suspend the trading of stock of a particular company moot if the SEC asserts it has no plans to consider further orders against that company?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes § 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 permit the Commission to issue consecutive orders for the suspension of trading of a particular company\u0027s stock?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe issue presented is not moot because the source of the injury \"is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" On the merits, § 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 does not grant the Commission authority to issue a series of summary orders that would suspend trading in a stock beyond the initial 10-day period, absent additional circumstances warranting such action. Justice William Rehnquist delivered the opinion that was unanimous as to the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the question of mootness, the Court\u0027s precedent provides that a case is not moot when \"(1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\" Because of the historic practices of CJL, of which Sloan still owns stock, it remains likely that the SEC will again suspend trading of its shares, creating a \"reasonable expectation of recurring injury\" to Sloan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the merits, the Court first looked to the language of § 12(k), which provides that the SEC may \"summarily to suspend trading in any security . . . for a period not exceeding ten days.\" The Court found that the SEC\u0027s interpretation of this provision as permitting redetermination every 10 days under a single set of circumstances was \"not the most logical or logical one.\" Moreover, the power to suspend, effectively indefinitely, the trading of a company\u0027s stock is \"an awesome power, with a potentially devastating impact on the issuer, its shareholders, and other investors.\" Such power may only arise from a \"clear mandate from Congress,\" which § 12(k) does not provide. The Court concluded that \"Congress did not intend the Commission to have the power to extend the length of suspensions under § 12(k) at all, much less to repeatedly extend such suspensions without any hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Brennan filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Thurgood Marshall joined. Justice Harry Blackmun filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27809,"name":"Harvey L.

When Albert Ohralik, a local attorney, learned of the accident, he visited McClintock in the hospital and offered to represent her in exchange for a portion of the proceeds collected from her insurer. Ohralik also approached Holbert at her home and obtained her oral assent to representation, which he secretly tape-recorded. Both women eventually discharged Ohralik and filed grievances with the local bar association, which in turn filed a formal complaint against Ohralik with the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of Ohio (Board). The Board found that Ohralik violated provisions of the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility that banned a lawyer’s in-person solicitation of employment to a non-lawyer and publicly reprimanded him. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio rejected Ohralik’s claim that his conduct was protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and increased the sanction against Ohralik to indefinite suspension.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo professional ethics rules for the legal profession that ban in-person solicitation of non-lawyers violate free speech guarantees under the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority. The Court held that a state may constitutionally discipline a lawyer for soliciting clients in person and for financial gain under circumstances likely to pose dangers that the state has a right to prevent. The Court further held that the state need not show actual harm or injury to the solicited clients to sustain a disciplinary action. Unlike other forms of advertising concerning the terms and availability of legal services, in-person solicitation often exerts pressure upon and requires an immediate response from the recipient, without providing time for comparison or reflection. Because the Court held that a state has a particularly strong interest in preventing aspects of solicitation that involve fraud, undue influence, intimidation, and overreach, a state may adopt an outright ban in order to maintain standards in the legal profession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which he expressed doubt as to whether the state’s interest in prohibiting even honest, unpressured commercial solicitation justified the restriction on the free flow of information. Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment in which he agreed that Ohio acted within the limits prescribed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but argued that the Court should grant even greater leeway in the ability of state bar associations to regulate the conduct of their members.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22360,"name":"Eugene Gressman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/eugene_gressman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Gressman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"eugene_gressman"},"advocate_description":"for appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11031"},{"advocate":{"ID":33695,"name":"John R.
