He attributed the backlog of pending cases to the judges’ inefficiency, laziness, and excessive vacations. Based on these statements, Garrison was tried and convicted of defamation under the Louisiana Criminal Defamation Statute, and the Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed. Garrison appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and argued that the statute impermissibly infringed on his First Amendment rights to freedom of expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Louisiana Criminal Defamation Statute unconstitutionally infringe on the First Amendment’s protection of the freedom of speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that a criminal libel statute should conform to the same restrictions as civil libel statutes to protect the freedom of expression under the First Amendment. Therefore, such statutes may only criminalize statements that are knowingly false or made with a reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. This limitation on libel statutes is in line with the precedent the Court established in \u003cem\u003eNew York Times v. Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e, and there is no reason that the freedom of speech protections should apply differently to a civil libel statute than to a criminal one. Based on this standard, the Louisiana Criminal Defamation Statute is unconstitutionally broad and infringes on the First Amendment’s protections of free speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Hugo L. Black wrote that the First Amendment protects citizens from being punished by the government for expressing an opinion, and therefore there should be no law permitting criminal punishment for libel. Justice William O. Douglas joined in the concurrence. Justice Douglas wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he argued that that the standard the majority opinion seeks to apply to criminal libel statutes does not adequately protect the freedom of speech. Justice Black joined in the concurring opinion. In his separate concurring opinion, Justice Arthur J. Goldberg wrote that the Constitution protects the absolute right of citizens and the press to criticize official conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22180,"name":"Eberhard P.

Since Hanna was a resident of Ohio, and Plumer was a resident of Massachusetts, the case was heard by a federal court in Massachusetts sitting in diversity jurisdiction. Plumer was served by leaving copies of the summons with his wife, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, Plumer successfully sought summary judgment at trial because Massachusetts law requires service to be delivered by hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parties argued on appeal over how the Erie doctrine applied to this case. Plumer asserted that it would find a question to be substantive rather than procedural under the outcome-determinative test when applying federal law would alter the outcome of the case. He pointed out that applying federal law would change the outcome of the case, which otherwise would be dismissed, so the state procedural requirements and the grant of summary judgment should be upheld. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eHow should the court determine whether to apply the state or federal rule?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn cases when it is rationally possible to classify a law as either substantive or procedural, the federal courts have the authority to control their own practice and pleading procedures. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision authored by Justice Warren, the Court ruled for Hanna. To raise the Erie doctrine, the Court reasoned, the effect of a procedural rule on the outcome of a case must abridge, enlarge, or modify the substantive law. There was no change to a substantive right here because the plaintiff simply could refile the case or serve the defendant personally. This issue thus related only to procedural requirements, so applying the outcome-determinative test was not appropriate. \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14300,"title":"Oral Argument - January 21, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14300"}],"citation":{"volume":"380","page":"460","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25631"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

A. Ivory, both black, entered McCrory’s Five and Ten Cent Store in Rock Hill, South Carolina. They made several purchases, then tried unsuccessfully to purchase food at the lunch counter. The store manager asked Hamm and Ivory to leave, but they refused to do so. The manager called the police, who again asked Hamm and Ivory to leave before finally arresting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city of Rock Hill charged Hamm with willfully and unlawfully trespassing at McCrory’s, in violation of city and state laws. He was tried in district court without a jury, found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of one hundred dollars or serve thirty days in jail. The Court of General Sessions and the Supreme Court of South Carolina both affirmed his conviction. The Supreme Court of South Carolina cited other South Carolina cases involving sit-down demonstrations, noting that those defendants consistently and unsuccessfully invoked the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process protections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Civil Rights Act, passed in 1964 while his appeal was pending, declared that all persons should be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Civil Rights Act forbid discrimination towards black customers at McCrory’s Five and Ten Cent Store if Hamm’s appeal was pending when the law took effect?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Tom C. Clark, the Court held in a combined case that sit-in demonstrations could not be the subject of federal or state trespass prosecutions, and that any such convictions on appeal must be reversed. Justice Clark noted that the Court historically gave weight to the common law doctrine of abatement, which applied changes in law that occur after a trial court’s judgment but before the decision of an appellate court to the original judgment. He explained that this rule did not depend on the explicit intention of Congress. As the Civil Rights Act clearly prevented the federal prosecution of individuals for attempting to make use of public accommodations, Justice Clark held that it must also prevent state prosecutions through the supremacy clause. He declined to answer the question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment alone prevented similar prosecutions at the state or federal level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices William O. Douglas and Arthur J. Goldberg concurred. Justice Douglas characterized the Civil Rights Act as a means of enforcing protections already enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, there was no real issue with applying it retroactively to already unconstitutional state prosecutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo Black dissented. He read nothing in the Civil Rights Act to suggest that Congress intended to reverse sit-in trespassing convictions that occurred before the act took effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan dissented. He rejected the majority’s assumption that the doctrine of abatement required courts to apply a federal change in law to Hamm’s state conviction through the supremacy clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart dissented. He argued that a state’s abatement policy was determined by that state, not by federal courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White dissented. He could not discern any constitutional problem with Hamm’s state court conviction, and was confident that Congress did not intent to abate similar existing convictions through the Civil Rights Act. He noted Congress’ silence on the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30616,"name":"Jack Greenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_greenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_greenberg"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner Hamm","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22028"},{"advocate":{"ID":19602,"name":"Constance Baker Motley","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/constance_baker_motley","view_count":0,"last_name":"Motley","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"constance_baker_motley"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner Lupper","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22029"},{"advocate":{"ID":21242,"name":"Daniel R.

In response B. Elton Cox, a leading member of CORE, and others planned to march through parts of Baton Rouge, LA, ending with a demonstration at the courthouse. An estimated 1,500 to 3,800 protesters demonstrated during the hearings of the 23 jailed members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaton Rouge Police Chief Wingate White confronted the protestors when they arrived at the courthouse, telling them that they must confine the demonstration \"to the west side of the street\" within a designated period of time. After the group began their demonstration, a sheriff ordered them to disperse. Officers then forcibly dispersed the demonstration and arrested several demonstrators, including Cox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCox was charged with four offenses under Louisiana law: criminal conspiracy, disturbing the peace, obstructing public passages, and picketing before a courthouse. He was acquitted of criminal conspiracy but convicted of the other three offenses. In accordance with Louisiana procedure, the Louisiana Supreme Court reviewed his \"disturbing the peace\" and \"obstructing public passages\" convictions on certiorari, and the \"courthouse picketing\" conviction on appeal, and the court affirmed all three convictions. Cox appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on the ground that all three statutes were unconstitutionally vague. This case (No. 24) addresses the \"disturbing the peace\" and \"obstructing public passages\" statutes, while the second case (No. 49) addresses the \"courthouse picketing\" statute.  \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Cox\u0027s conviction based on violation of the Louisiana statute prohibiting \"disturbing the peace\" violate his rights to free speech and assembly under the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes Cox\u0027s conviction based on violation of the Louisiana statute prohibiting \"obstructing public passages\" violate his rights to free speech and assembly under the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Louisiana\u0027s \"disturbing the peace\" statute is unconstitutional on its face because it is vague in its overly broad scope, and the policy of Baton Rouge law enforcement of giving officers complete discretion in enforcing the \"obstructing public passages\" statute deprives Cox of his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly.

Goldberg, the Court was unanimous in finding the \"disturbing the peace\" statute unconstitutionally vague, and a majority of the Court (7-2) found that Cox\u0027s conviction for \"obstructing public passages\" violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Justices Hugo L. Black and Tom C. Clark each filed concurring opinions as to the \"disturbing the peace\" statute. Justices Black and Clark also concurred as to the \"obstructing public passages\" conviction, with Justice Byron R. White, joined by Justice John M. Harlan, dissenting as to that issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14465,"title":"Oral Argument - October 21, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14465"}],"citation":{"volume":"379","page":"536","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25645"},"decisions":[{"description":"The Louisiana statute prohibiting \"disturbing the peace\" is unconstitutionally vague and broad in scope and thus Cox\u0027s conviction under that statute violates his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech and assembly.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

If, however, a purchaser missed an interest payment on the property, the land was immediately forfeited back to the state unless the owner made the payment before the land could be re-sold. Under this program, Greenbury Simmons purchased and then forfeited some land in 1947. Just over five years later he offered to pay the interest to re-acquire the property. The state refused to comply with his wishes citing a 1941 amendment to its law which gave individuals five years to claim their forfeited land. Simmons\u0027s land was sold to the City of El Paso in 1955.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the 1941 amendment to the Texas law violate the Contract Clause of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWhile the Court agreed that the power of a state to modify the obligation of a contract is not limitless, it found that the 1941 amendment was not offensive to the Contract Clause. Justice White reasoned that the amendment was enacted with the intent of restoring \"confidence in the stability and integrity of land titles\" and to rectify difficulties that mineral speculators were creating for the state as it attempted to implement its land sale program. White argued that the five-year limit provided \"purchasers with a bona fide interest in their lands\" plenty of time to rescue their property while it served an important state interest of encouraging defaulting purchasers to comply with their contractual obligations to Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14552,"title":"Oral Argument - November 17, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14552"}],"citation":{"volume":"379","page":"497","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25677"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Archie Brown, a San Francisco longshoreman and admitted member of the Communist Party, was three times elected to the executive board of the local International Longshoremen\u0027s and Warehousemen\u0027s Union from 1959 through 1961. On May 24, 1961, Brown was charged with violating section 504 of the LMRDA. No evidence was presented at trial suggesting that Brown was involved in any other illegal activity or plotting a political strike. Brown was found guilty and sentenced to six months in prison. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting \u003cem\u003een banc\u003c/em\u003e, reversed the conviction and found that section 504 violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution. In response to appeal by the United States to the Supreme Court, Brown also argued that section 504 constitutes a bill of attainder, a law that targets a single individual or group, and therefore violates Article I, Section 9.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes section 504 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 violate the First or Fifth Amendments or Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, section 504 violates Article I of the Constitution. In 5-4 opinion authored by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court found that section 504 was indeed a bill of attainder. Section 504, the Chief Justice argued, \"plainly\" constituted a bill of attainder, defined in the opinion as \"legislative punishment, of any form or severity, of specifically designated persons or groups,\" by designating \"in no uncertain terms the persons who posses the feared characteristics.\" After finding that section 504 violated the Bill of Attainder Clause, the Court found no need to address questions pertaining to the First and Fifth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14549,"title":"Oral Argument - March 29, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14549"}],"citation":{"volume":"381","page":"437","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25680"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

A gynecologist at the Yale School of Medicine, C. Lee Buxton, opened a birth control clinic in New Haven in conjunction with Estelle Griswold, who was the head of Planned Parenthood in Connecticut. They were arrested and convicted of violating the law, and their convictions were affirmed by higher state courts. Their plan was to use the clinic to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under the Fourteenth Amendment before the Supreme Court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Constitution protect the right of marital privacy against state restrictions on a couple\u0027s ability to be counseled in the use of contraceptives?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA right to privacy can be inferred from several amendments in the Bill of Rights, and this right prevents states from making the use of contraception by married couples illegal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Douglas, the Court ruled that the Constitution did in fact protect the right of marital privacy against state restrictions on contraception. While the Court explained that the Constitution does not explicitly protect a general right to privacy, the various guarantees within the Bill of Rights create penumbras, or zones, that establish a right to privacy. Together, the First, Third, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments create the right to privacy in marital relations. The Connecticut statute conflicted with the exercise of this right and was therefore held null and void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Goldberg, joined by Justices Warren and Brennan, concurred. Rather than finding that the right to privacy was contained in imaginary penumbras, Goldberg located it in the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan concurred, arguing that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to privacy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice White concurred, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment was the proper basis for the decision. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Black, joined by Justice Stewart, dissented. Unpersuaded by the loose reasoning of the majority, Black felt that there was no way to infer that the Constitution contained a right to privacy. He also dismissed the views of the concurrences that it could be found in the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart, joined by Justice Black, filed a separate dissenting opinion. Stewart argued that despite his personal view that the law was \"uncommonly silly,\" he felt that the Court had no choice but to find it constitutional. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42648,"name":"Thomas I.

He argued that he was subject to the exemption under Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, which provides that conscientious objectors need not serve in the armed forces if they have a specific religious training or belief that is related to a Supreme Being. Seeger was a genuine pacifist who made his objection in good faith, but he was denied the exemption because he did not believe in a Supreme Being, since he was agnostic about the existence of God. On the other hand, the root of his objection was based on religious study and faith rather than his personal morals. He argued that the provision containing the exemption was unconstitutional because it required proof of a belief in a Supreme Being.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the exemption provision unconstitutional for requiring proof of a Supreme Being?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA person can have conscientious objector status based on a belief that has a similar position in that person\u0027s life to the belief in God. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision authored by Justice Clark, the Court ruled that the statute was constitutional. Since there are over 250 religious groups in the United States, the Court reasoned, Congress could not be expected to specifically cover each of them in this federal law. In general, a conscientious objection is based on a religious belief rather than political, sociological, or philosophical views. The term \"Supreme Being\" should be interpreted to cover all types of faith, and the defendant\u0027s belief system fell within them, so it qualified for the exemption. However, the statute was held to be constitutional on its face. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Douglas concurred. \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14399,"title":"Oral Argument - November 16, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14399"},{"id":14505,"title":"Oral Argument - November 17, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14505"}],"citation":{"volume":"380","page":"163","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25702"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

His restaurant, Ollie\u0027s Barbecue, was located on a major road in Birmingham, Alabama and was close to an interstate highway. Half of its food came from outside Alabama, although its suppliers were local. It served a meaningful number of customers from outside the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe argued that his business was small and had no impact on interstate commerce, and that he did provide limited services to African Americans. McClung prevailed in federal district court and received an injunction barring the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act against Ollie\u0027s Barbecue. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination against African Americans by a restaurant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eFederal laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply not only to restaurants that serve interstate travelers, but also to restaurants that use food that has traveled in interstate commerce, which must provide fully equal access to African Americans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision authored by Justice Clark, the Court held McClung could be barred from discriminating against African Americans under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Court reasoned that discrimination in restaurants posed significant burdens on \"the interstate flow of food and upon the movement on products generally.\" Furthermore, discrimination also posed restrictions on blacks who traveled from state to state. The Court concluded that the Civil Rights Act was a rational way to protect interstate commerce because it could be expected to reduce the discrimination that undermined it. \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13972,"title":"Oral Argument - October 05, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13972"}],"citation":{"volume":"379","page":"294","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25710"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Phillips, of more than $300. The man then fled the store, and Phillips observed him talking to another man at a nearby intersection. A police dog led officers across the street from the 7-11 store to the front yard of a nearby residence, where Pointer was standing. A search of Pointer\u0027s person revealed eighty-one dollars in his billfold, and a later search revealed sixty-five dollars hidden in a discarded shoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police arrested Pointer and Lloyd Earl Dillard and took them before a state judge for a preliminary hearing; the state charged them with robbing Phillips of $375 by assault, violence, or by putting in fear of life or bodily injury, in violation of Texas law. An assistant attorney general conducted the prosecution and examined witnesses, but neither of the defendants had a lawyer. Dillard tried to cross-examine Phillips, but Pointer did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePointer was indicted on the robbery charge. At trial, Pointer testified on his own behalf, denying his alleged role in the robbery and swearing he had never been in the 7-11 store. The state offered a transcript of Phillips\u0027 testimony as evidence because Phillips had since moved out of Texas and did not intend to return. The defense objected to the use of the transcript as a denial of Pointer\u0027s right to confront a witness. The trial judge overruled because Pointer was present at the preliminary hearing, and Pointer was convicted. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction, rejecting Pointer\u0027s claim that the use of the transcript violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Texas violate Pointer\u0027s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by admitting evidence drawn from a preliminary hearing where Pointer was not represented by counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Hugo Black, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment\u0027s right of confrontation required Texas to allow Pointer an opportunity to confront Dillard through counsel. Justice Black declined to answer whether the Sixth Amendment required Texas to appoint counsel to represent Pointer at a preliminary hearing. Justice Black described the history of the Sixth Amendment in the Court, writing that the Fourteenth Amendment imposed the right to counsel on the states. He emphasized the importance of a defendant\u0027s right to confront witnesses against him and described it as a fundamental right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Marshall Harlan II concurred in the result, rejecting the majority\u0027s assumption that Sixth Amendment rights were incorporated and applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead, he argued that a right of confrontation was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart concurred in the result, also disagreeing that the states were limited by the Sixth Amendment. He characterized the right to cross-examine as one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Arthur Goldberg concurred. He emphasized that the Court largely agreed that certain basic rights were fundamental and not to be denied by either state or federal governments under the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13998,"title":"Oral Argument - March 15, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13998"}],"citation":{"volume":"380","page":"400","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25715"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

California\u003c/em\u003e (1947), the Court ruled that the federal government owned rights to the undersea land off the California coast, an area with rich oil and mineral deposits. The Court held that California\u0027s rights were limited to low and inland waters and appointed a special master to better define the limits of California\u0027s land rights. In a report filed in 1952, the special master based his definition on the one used by the federal government in foreign relations. In 1953, before the Court considered the special master\u0027s report, Congress passed the Submerged Land Act, granting to the states\u0027 ownership of underwater land within their borders \"as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union.\" The act limited states\u0027 seaward rights, however, to no more than three miles from the coastline. The act also acknowledged states\u0027 ownership of land beneath inland waters. The act gave no specific definition of either \"coastline\" or \"inland waters\" and did not address bodies of water adjoining the sea, such as bays.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo rights to the undersea land off the California coast beyond the three-mile limit described in the Submerged Land Act, particularly in the case of bodies of water adjoining the ocean, belong to California or to the federal government?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe rights belong to the federal government. In a 5-2 decision authored by Justice John M. Harlan, the Court adopted the approach used by the special master and applied the definition used by the United States in foreign relations. Justice Harlan noted that no consensus on the definition of \"inland waters\" seemed to exist, and thus chose to establish a reliable, tenable definition, rather than one that could be easily amended by an act of Congress. \"\u0027Freezing\u0027 the meaning of \u0027inland waters\u0027…serves to fulfill the requirements of definiteness and stability which should attend any congressional grant of property rights belonging to the United States.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14136,"title":"Oral Argument - December 08, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14136"},{"id":14575,"title":"Oral Argument - December 07, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14575"}],"citation":{"volume":"381","page":"139","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25722"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Henry allegedly made indecent proposals and offensive contact when he gave a ride to a hitchhiker.  Henry’s counsel failed to object to the testimony when it was entered into evidence as required by local rules.    Henry’s counsel later objected to the testimony in a motion for directed verdict, but the court denied the motion and the jury found him guilty.  On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that the testimony was improperly admitted, and excused Henry’s lack of objection because he was represented by out-of-state counsel, who were unfamiliar with the local rules of criminal procedure.  After this judgment, Mississippi filed a Suggestion of Error pointing out that Henry was represented by competent in state counsel as well as out of state counsel.  As a result, the Mississippi Supreme Court withdrew its first opinion and affirmed the conviction, holding that even honest mistakes are binding.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Henry’s conviction violate due process where it is based on evidence obtained in an illegal search, and that evidence was later objected to in a motion for directed verdict instead of at the time the evidence was introduced?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eMaybe.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion, vacating the lower judgment and remanding the case.  The Supreme Court held that the Mississippi rule requiring contemporaneous objection to evidence serves a legitimate state interest, but the motion for directed verdict may also serve the same interest.  The Court remanded the case to consider whether Henry had knowingly waived his objection to the officer’s testimony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent, stating that the Supreme Court should decide the issue of waiver instead of remanding.  Justice John M. Harlan wrote a dissent, expressing that the Supreme Court should dismiss the case because the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled on adequate state law grounds to preclude the U.S. Supreme Court from reviewing the case.  Justice Tom C. Clark and Justice Potter Stewart joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17870,"name":"Barbara A.

In 1898 Louisiana adopted a constitutional amendment that imposed burdensome requirements for voter registration, but which had a clause exempting those people registered to vote as of January 1, 1867 and the son or grandson of such people. African- Americans were not entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867.

The Supreme Court held that the Louisiana constitution\u0027s voter registration requirements are unconstitutional. With Justice Hugo L. Black writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that the registration provisions stood in conflict with the Fifteenth Amendment\u0027s and 42 U.S.C. § 1971(a)\u0027s prohibitions against discrimination in voting because of race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Marshall Harlan II disagreed that 42 U.S.C. § 1971(a) was applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14493,"title":"Oral Argument - January 27, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14493"},{"id":14695,"title":"Oral Argument - January 26, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14695"}],"citation":{"volume":"380","page":"145","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25736"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The board could disapprove films that were obscene, debased or corrupted morals, or tended to incite crime. There was no time limit on the decision-making process.

The Court decision reflected a concern that the statute provides the danger of \"unduly suppressing protected expression.\" The board was allowed overly broad licensing discretion with a lack of statutory provisions for judicial participation in the the procedure to prohibit a film. The Court established three guidelines as adequate safeguards to protect against the \"undue inhibition of protected expression.\" These guidelines are to: (1) place the burden of proving the film is unprotected expression on the censors, (2) require judicial determination to impose a valid determination, and (3) require prompt determination \"within a specified time period.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14195,"title":"Oral Argument - November 19, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14195"}],"citation":{"volume":"380","page":"51","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25737"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

On May 25, 1961, a military convoy escorted Ralph D. Abernathy, an African-American pastor from Montgomery, and 10 others (both African-American and white) to the bus terminal. The group purchased tickets, and all 11 went to sit at the lunch counter.  There were at least 30 people in the station and several hundred people outside who could see through the plate-glass windows to the lunch counter. Given the tense atmosphere in the city and particularly at the bus station, Colonel Poarch of the National Guard directed the Sheriff of Montgomery County to arrest the eleven men. In his opinion, their actions seemed “calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbernathy was convicted in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County on charges of disturbing the peace and unlawful assembly. He appealed the case and argued that his Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. The Court of Appeals of the State of Alabama affirmed the conviction.

The Court reasoned that police misconduct prior to Mapp had already occurred and would not be corrected by releasing the prisoners involved. The Court also argued that applying the Mapp decision retroactively to all cases would threaten the \"delicate state-federal relationship\" and would \"tax the administration of justice to the utmost.\" Only cases on direct review at the time of the Mapp ruling or later cases would be subject to retroactive consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14220,"title":"Oral Argument - March 11, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14220"}],"citation":{"volume":"381","page":"618","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25760"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.
