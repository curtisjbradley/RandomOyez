Before Jefferson took office on March 4, 1801, Adams and Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which created new courts, added judges, and gave the president more control over appointment of judges. The Act was essentially an attempt by Adams and his party to frustrate his successor, as he used the act to appoint 16 new circuit judges and 42 new justices of the peace. The appointees were approved by the Senate, but they would not be valid until their commissions were delivered by the Secretary of State. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam Marbury had been appointed Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia, but his commission was not delivered. Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to compel the new Secretary of State, James Madison, to deliver the documents. Marbury, joined by three other similarly situated appointees, petitioned for a writ of mandamus compelling the delivery of the commissions. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo the plaintiffs have a right to receive their commissions?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCan they sue for their commissions in court?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes the Supreme Court have the authority to order the delivery of their commissions?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that Madison’s refusal to deliver the commission was illegal, but did not order Madison to hand over Marbury’s commission via writ of mandamus. Instead, the Court held that the provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 enabling Marbury to bring his claim to the Supreme Court was itself unconstitutional, since it purported to extend the Court’s original jurisdiction beyond that which Article III, Section 2, established. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarshall expanded that a writ of mandamus was the proper way to seek a remedy, but concluded the Court could not issue it. Marshall reasoned that the Judiciary Act of 1789 conflicted with the Constitution. Congress did not have power to modify the Constitution through regular legislation because Supremacy Clause places the Constitution before the laws. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn so holding,

The \u003cem\u003eFlying-Fish\u003c/em\u003e, which had left the French-controlled Haitian port of Jeremie, was suspected of being an American ship in violation of the United States\u0027 embargo on France. In the embargoes, the President was given the power to instruct the Navy to stop any American ships suspected to be en route to a French port. President John Adams, meanwhile, had issued a letter to the Secretary of the Navy to stop all American ships and ships suspected of being American travelling both to and from French-controlled ports. The federal district court judge freed the \u003cem\u003eFlying-Fish\u003c/em\u003e, but did not award damages for its illegal capture. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and held that George Little, the captain of the \u003cem\u003eBoston\u003c/em\u003e should pay damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the President have the authority to issue the order to capture ships travelling from French ports?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision, the Court affirmed the Court of Appeals. In the opinion, written by Chief Justice John Marshall, the Court held the President did not have \"any special authority\" to order the seizure of non-American ships and ships departing French ports. Even if the \u003cem\u003eFlying-Fish\u003c/em\u003e had been an American ship, it still would not have been subject to seizure. Since Little had illegally seized the ship, he was also liable for

The following year, the legislature voided the law and declared all rights and claims under it to be invalid. In 1800, John Peck acquired land that was part of the original legislative grant. He then sold the land to Robert Fletcher three years later, claiming that the land sales had been legitimate. Fletcher argued that since the original sale of the land had been declared invalid, Peck had no legal right to sell the land and thus committed a breach of contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCould the contract between Fletcher and Peck be invalidated by an act of the Georgia legislature?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe legislature’s repeal of the law was unconstitutional under Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the United States Constitution.

In 1781, Denny Martin, a British subject, inherited land from his uncle, a Loyalist. The following year, the Virginia legislature voided the land grant and transferred the land back to Virginia. Virginia granted a portion of this land to David Hunter. A federal treaty dictated that Lord Fairfax was entitled to the property. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Virginia Supreme Court upheld Virginia\u0027s law permitting the confiscation of property, even though it conflicted with the federal treaty. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the treaty superseded state law under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI. On remand, the Virginia Court of Appeals declined to follow the ruling and argued that the law granting the Supreme Court appellate review over state court decisions, section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the Act), was unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Section 25 of the Judiciary Act, which grants the U.S. Supreme Court appellate review over state court cases involving federal law, unconstitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Article VI of the US Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), combined with the grant of appellate jurisdiction in Article III, gives federal courts the power to review state court decisions that interpret federal law or the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court rejected the claim that Virginia and the national government were equal sovereigns. Relying on the Supremacy Clause, Justice Story held that federal interpretations of federal law should supersede state interpretations.

In 1818, the state of Maryland passed legislation to impose taxes on the bank. James W. McCulloch, the cashier of the Baltimore branch of the bank, refused to pay the tax.

The legislature changed the school\u0027s corporate charter by transferring the control of trustee appointments to the governor.

In a 5-to-1 decision, the Court concluded that the Contract Clause applies to private as well as public corporations. The Court held that the College\u0027s corporate charter qualified as a contract between private parties, with which the legislature could not interfere. The fact that the government had commissioned the charter did not transform the school into a civil institution.

Johnson\u0027s heirs sued M\u0027Intosh in the United States District Court to recover the land.

Livingston and Robert Fulton a 20-year monopoly over navigation on waters within state jurisdiction. Aaron Ogden and other competitors tried to forestall the monopoly, but Livingston and Fulton largely succeeded in selling franchise or buying competitors’ boats. Thomas Gibbons -- a steamboat owner who did business between New York and New Jersey under a federal coastal license – formed a partnership with Ogden, which fell apart after three years when Gibbons operated another steamboat on a New York route belonging to Ogden.

Worcester and others, all non-Native Americans, were indicted in the supreme court for the county of Gwinnett in the state of Georgia for \"residing within the limits of the Cherokee nation without a license\" and \"without having taken the oath to support and defend the constitution and laws of the state of Georgia.\" They were indicted under an 1830 act of the Georgia legislature entitled \"an act to prevent the exercise of assumed and arbitrary power by all persons, under pretext of authority from the Cherokee Indians.\" Among other things, Worcester argued that the state could not maintain the prosecution because the statute violated the Constitution, treaties between the United States and the Cherokee nation, and an act of Congress entitled \"an act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes.\" Worcester was convicted and sentenced to \"hard labour in the penitentiary for four years.\" The U.S. Supreme Court received the case on a writ of error.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the state of Georgia have the authority to regulate the intercourse between citizens of its state and members of the Cherokee Nation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice John Marshall, the Court held that the Georgia act, under which Worcester was prosecuted, violated the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States. Noting that the \"treaties and laws of the United States contemplate the Indian territory as completely separated from that of the states; and provide that all intercourse with them shall be carried on exclusively by the government of the union,\" Chief Justice Marshall argued, \"The Cherokee nation, then, is a distinct community occupying its own territory in which the laws of Georgia can have no force. The whole intercourse between the United States and this nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.\" The Georgia act thus interfered with the federal government\u0027s authority and was unconstitutional. Justice Henry Baldwin dissented for procedural reasons and on the merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"31","page":"515","year":"1832","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27147"},"decisions":[{"description":"The Constitution

The Charles River Bridge Company filed suit, claiming the legislature had defaulted on its initial contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the legislature enter into an economic contract with the Charles River Bridge Company that was impaired by the second charter in violation of Article I Section 10 of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-to-2 decision, the Court held that the state had not entered a contract that prohibited the construction of another bridge on the river at a later date. The Court held that the legislature neither gave exclusive control over the waters of the river nor invaded corporate privilege by interfering with the company\u0027s profit-making ability. In balancing the rights of private property against the need for economic development, the Court found that the community interest in creating new channels of travel and trade had priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62570,"name":"Warren Dutton","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/warren_dutton","view_count":0,"last_name":"Dutton","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"warren_dutton"},"advocate_description":"for the plaintiff in error","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21305"},{"advocate":{"ID":62553,"name":"Daniel Webster","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/daniel_webster","view_count":0,"last_name":"Webster","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"daniel_webster"},"advocate_description":"for the plaintiff in error","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21306"},{"advocate":{"ID":62571,"name":"Simon Greenleaf","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/simon_greenleaf","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenleaf","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"simon_greenleaf"},"advocate_description":"for the defendant in error","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21307"},{"advocate":{"ID":29928,"name":"John Davis","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/john_davis","view_count":0,"last_name":"Davis","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"john_davis"},"advocate_description":"for the defendant in error","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21308"}],"citation":{"volume":"36","page":"420","year":"1837","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27151"},"decisions":[{"description":"The Massachusetts statute establishing the Warren Bridge Company did not violate Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15054,"name":"Roger B.

In 1832, a black woman named Margaret Morgan moved from Maryland to Pennsylvania. Although she was never formally emancipated, her owner John Ashmore granted her virtually full freedom. Ashmore\u0027s heirs wanted her returned as a slave and sent Edward Prigg to capture her in Pennsylvania. After returning Morgan to Maryland, Prigg was convicted in a Pennsylvania court for violating the 1826 law. Prigg unsuccessfully argued before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that both the 1788 and 1826 laws violated the constitutional guarantee of extradition among states and the federal government\u0027s Fugitive Slave Law of 1793.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Pennsylvania\u0027s law prohibiting the extradition of Negroes to other states for the purpose of slavery violate Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution? Did the law violate the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793 as applied by the Supremacy Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. Justice Joseph Story delivered the opinion of the Court. The 1788 and 1826 Pennsylvania laws contradicted Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution and the Fugitive Slave Law. The Supremacy Clause assured that federal laws prevailed over the state laws. The decision did not wholly end asylum across state lines for slaves. Story granted that the state laws put in place by slave states to recapture slaves in free states only had to be enforced by federal officials, and not state magistrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"41","page":"539","year":"1842","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27153"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15208,"name":"Taney Court (1842-1843)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/taney6","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15054,"name":"Roger B.

The charter strictly limited suffrage and made no provision for amendment. Dissident groups, protesting the charter, held a popular convention to draft a new constitution and to elect a governor. The old charter government declared martial law and put down the rebellion, although no federal troops were sent. One of the insurgents, Martin Luther, brought suit claiming the old government was not \"a republican form of government\" and all its acts were thereby invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Court have the constitutional authority to declare which group constituted the official government of Rhode Island?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that \"the power of determining that a state government has been lawfully established\" did not belong to federal courts, and that it was not the function of such courts to prescribe the qualifications for voting in the States. The Court held that the creation of republican forms of government and the control of domestic violence were matters of an essentially political nature committed by the Constitution to the other branches of government.

On August 26, Lieutenant Thomas Gedney, of the American ship \u003cem\u003eWashington\u003c/em\u003e, discovered \u003cem\u003eThe Amistad\u003c/em\u003e off the Long Island shore and brought all persons involved into the district court of Connecticut. Ruiz and Montez claimed the slaves were their property and requested the relief of having their property released to them. The alleged slaves argued that they were native-born, free Africans who had been unlawfully and forcibly kidnapped to be sold as slaves. The district court agreed and held that the alleged slaves should be delivered to the President of the United States to be transported back to Africa. The Circuit Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre the alleged slaves the property of Ruiz and Montez?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Joseph Story delivered the opinion of the 7-1 majority. The Court held that the kidnapping and transportation of the alleged slaves was illegal because the laws of Spain forbid the slave trade and the importation of slaves into the dominions of Spain. Therefore, because the alleged slaves were not in fact slaves, they were kidnapped Africans who were unlawfully taken from their shores and detained on \u003cem\u003eThe Amistad\u003c/em\u003e. The United States is bound to respect the rights of the free Africans as much as the rights of the Spanish subjects, and therefore the Africans’ rights to their own lives and liberty must supersede any obligations that Spain’s treaty with the United States imposes to protect property rights. However, the Court also held that, when \u003cem\u003eThe Amistad\u003c/em\u003e arrived in American waters, it was under the control of the free Africans, who were clearly not importing themselves as slaves, so they need not be delivered to the President to be transported back to Africa. Instead, they should simply be declared free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Henry Baldwin dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Philip P.
