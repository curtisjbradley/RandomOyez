Section 1, by engaging in various conspiracies aimed at forcing certain other primary insurers to change the terms of their standard domestic commercial general liability insurance policies. After the actions were consolidated for litigation, the district court granted the defendants\u0027 motion to dismiss, holding that the conduct alleged fell within the grant of antitrust immunity contained in Section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1012(b), and that none of the conduct amounted to a \"boycott\" within the meaning of the Section 3(b), 15 U.S.C. Section 1013(b), exemption to that grant of immunity. The court of appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eFirst, did the plaintiffs sufficiently allege \"boycotts,\" as used in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Section 3(b)? Second, did international comity counsel against exercising Sherman Act jurisdiction over the conduct of the London-based defendants?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes to the first; no to the second. The Court, speaking through Justice Antonin Scalia, held that a boycott exists when, in order to coerce a target into certain terms on one transaction, parties refuse to engage in other, unrelated transactions with the target. On most counts, the plaintiffs\u0027 allegations, construed favorably, described boycotts. Justice David H. Souter wrote for the Court on jurisdiction over foreign conduct, holding that it was appropriate in this case because there is no true conflict between domestic and foreign law. That is, because the London reinsurers can comply with both British law and the Sherman Act, international comity does not counsel against exercising subject matter jurisdiction in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35526,"name":"Molly S.

In response, the officers commanded Dickerson to stop and proceeded to frisk him. An officer discovered a lump in Dickerson\u0027s jacket pocket, and, upon further tactile investigation, formed the belief that it was cocaine. The officer reached into Dickerson\u0027s pocket and confirmed that the lump was in fact a small bag of cocaine. Consequently, Dickerson was charged with possession of a controlled substance. He requested that the cocaine be excluded from evidence, but the trial court denied his request and he was found guilty. Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed, and the State Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a police officer detects contraband through his or her sense of touch during a protective patdown search, does the Fourth Amendment permit its seizure and subsequent introduction into evidence? Was the police officer who frisked Dickerson adhering to the Fourth Amendment when he formed the belief, through his sense of touch, that the lump in Dickerson\u0027s jacket pocket was cocaine?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and No. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Byron R. White, the Court recalled that a police officer may seize contraband when it is in plain sight, and \"its incriminating character is immediately apparent\". It held that instances in which an officer uses the sense of sight to discover illegal goods are analogous to those involving the sense of touch. The Court also reasoned that the tactile detection of contraband during a lawful pat-down search does not constitute any further invasion of privacy, therefore warrantless seizure was permissible. The Court also concluded that the police officer frisking Dickerson stepped outside the boundaries outlined in \u003cem\u003eTerry v. Ohio\u003c/em\u003e which requires a protective pat-down search to involve only what is necessary for the detection of weapons. In fact the officer was already aware that Dickerson\u0027s jacket pocket did not contain a weapon, when he detected the cocaine through further tactile investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35794,"name":"Michael O.

In each robbery, he used a gun. Subsequently, Deal was convicted, in a single proceeding, of six counts of carrying and using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 USC section 924(c)(1). Section 924(c)(1) prescribes a 5-year prison term for the first such conviction, in addition to the punishment provided for the crime of violence, and requires a 20-year sentence \"in the case of [a] second or subsequent conviction under this subsection.\" The District Court sentenced Deal to 5 years\u0027 imprisonment on the first section 924(c)(1) count and to 20 years on each of the five other counts, the terms to run consecutively. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a criminal\u0027s second through sixth convictions under section 924(c)(1) in a single proceeding arise \"in the case of his second or subsequent conviction\" within the meaning of section 924(c)(1)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that Deal\u0027s second through sixth convictions in a single proceeding arose \"in the case of his second or subsequent conviction\" within the meaning of section 924(c)(1), finding that the statute was not ambiguous. The Court rejected that the rule of lenity applied because Deal\u0027s \"105-year sentence \u0027is so glaringly unjust.\u0027\" Writing for the court, Justice Scalia said the 105 years sentence for the gun offenses was not unjust \"simply because [Deal] managed to evade detection, prosecution and conviction for the first five offenses and was ultimately tried for all six in a single proceeding.\" Justice Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Sandra Day O\u0027Connor and Harry A. Blackmun joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35754,"name":"Miguel A.

By 1981, WBEC had accrued a state tax deficit of $14 million. After the Board of Equalization rejected WBEC\u0027s claim that those taxes were invalid, the company paid its deficit, and, according to WBEC\u0027s contract, was subsequently reimbursed by the United States Government. In January of 1988, WBEC continued to challenge the taxes by filing an action in state court. This action concluded with an agreement between the state of California and WBEC that the company receive a $3 million refund. The Federal Government filed a suit in the Eastern District of California in May of 1988, arguing that the remaining state taxes totaling $11 million were also illegitimate. The District Court ruled in favor of the state of California, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay the United States Government receive compensation for the state of California\u0027s allegedly unfounded taxation of a private federal contractor?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court determined that regardless of the fact that the Federal Government reimburses WBEC for its taxes, the private company is still the taxpayer. And, the taxpayer had its opportunity to go to court and challenge the state taxes imposed upon it, and accepted the result. The Court found that the Federal Government does not have a separate right to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39952,"name":"Robert D.

Biggins, a 62-year-old employee who worked for Hazen for just under 10 years.  Biggins’ pension was set to vest at the completion of 10 years of service.  Biggins sued Hazen and its owners, alleging that his termination violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and several provisions of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  At trial, the jury ruled in favor of Biggins, finding that Hazen violated ERISA and “willfully” violated the ADEA.  The willful violation gave rise to liquidated damages.  The district court judge granted Hazen’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, reversing the finding of willfulness which eliminated the liquidated damages.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the jury verdict and reversed the finding of willfulness, holding that Hazen knowingly violated the ADEA by showing a “reckless disregard” for the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Courts below err in sustaining Biggin\u0027s claim under the ADEA, where the finding of age discrimination was based on pension vesting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid the Court of Appeals err in reinstating an award of liquidated damages for willful ADEA violation that had been set aside by the District Court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no.  Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, writing for a unanimous court, vacated the court of appeals\u0027 judgment and remanded for further proceedings.  The Supreme Court held that interfering with an employee’s pension does not automatically violate the ADEA, though it is a clear ERISA violation.  While older employees may have more years of service, age and years of service are independent of each other.  On remand, the court of appeals should reconsider whether there is sufficient evidence to support an ADEA violation independent of the pension interference.  The Court also held that the court of appeals applied the proper definition of willfulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Anthony M. Kennedy concurred, noting that nothing in the majority opinion should be read as supporting the “disparate impact” theory of Title VII.  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35597,"name":"Maurice M.

The district court agreed that the procedures were unconstitutional and prevented the enforcement of the applicable statute. After multiple appeals, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit instructed the state to amend its procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo Kentucky\u0027s involuntary commitment procedures for retarded persons violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court held that Kentucky\u0027s procedures for involuntarily committing mentally retarded persons did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that because retarded persons are not a suspect classification, Kentucky\u0027s statute warranted only rational basis scrutiny – the Court\u0027s lowest level of scrutiny. Consequently, the Court concluded that the state met its burden that its procedures were rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and were constitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor wrote separately, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. She argued, in contrast to the majority, that Kentucky\u0027s commitment procedures were irrational. Justice Harold A. Blackmun also dissented. He argued that laws that discriminate against the mentally retarded warrant heightened scrutiny by the Court. Justice David H. Souter, joined by Justices Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, and in part by Justice O\u0027Connor, dissented. He argued that Kentucky\u0027s commitment procedures were not supported by any rational justification.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45488,"name":"William K.

He pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree murder in Nevada state court.  After a court-ordered psychiatric examination, Moran was found competent to stand trial.  Two and a half months later, Moran told the court he wanted to discharge his attorney and change his pleas to guilty.  Moran said he wanted to prevent anyone from introducing any favorable evidence.  After some questioning, the judge accepted Moran’s waiver of his right to counsel and the guilty pleas.  The court sentenced him to death.  The Supreme Court of Nevada affirmed as to two of the murders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter sentencing, Moran claimed he was mentally incompetent to represent himself and sought post-conviction relief in state court.  The court rejected Moran’s claim based on findings from the psychiatric evaluations.  The Supreme Court of Nevada dismissed his appeal.  Moran then filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court.  The district court denied the petition, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that there was enough doubt at the time Moran pleaded guilty that the trial court should have held a hearing to evaluate whether Moran could make a “reasoned choice” among the alternatives given.  The record did not support a finding that Moran was capable of making a reasoned choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require a trial court to apply a heightened \"reasoned choice\" standard to determine the competency of a defendant to enter a plea of guilty or waive counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for a 7-2 majority, reversed the Ninth Circuit and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that pleading guilty and waiving a right to counsel do not require a higher level of competency that standing trial.  There is no reason to believe waiving these rights requires a higher mental capacity than waiving other constitutional rights.  Whether a defendant is able to adequately defend himself without an attorney is irrelevant to this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Anthony M. Kennedy concurred in part and concurred in the judgment, writing that using the same competency standard for pleading guilty without counsel and standing trial with counsel does not violate due process.  Justice Antonin Scalia joined in Justice Kennedy’s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun dissented, arguing that courts should conduct a specific inquiry to determine whether a defendant can proceed without counsel when the accused’s competency to stand trial has already been questioned.

He attended public school through the eighth grade where the local school board provided a sign-language interpreter. Zobrest\u0027s parents elected to send their son to a Roman Catholic high school and requested that the local school board continue to provide their son with a sign-language interpreter. The school board denied the request on constitutional grounds. The Zobrests then filed suit, alleging that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment required the school district to provide the interpreter and that the Establishment Clause did not bar such relief. The District Court granted the school district summary judgment on the ground that the interpreter would act as a conduit for the child\u0027s religious inculcation, thereby promoting his religious development at government expense in violation of the Establishment Clause. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a school district decline to provide an interpreter to a deaf child based on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that the Establishment Clause did not bar the school district from providing the requested interpreter. Chief Justice Rehnquist reasoned that, because the IDEA creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school, the presence of an interpreter is not linked to the state and is the result of the private decision of individual\u0027s parents. \"The service at issue in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as \u0027handicapped\u0027 under the IDEA, without regard to the \u0027sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature\u0027 of the school the child attends,\" wrote Chief Justice Rehnquist.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43859,"name":"William B.

When Lambert refused to hand it over, Graham shot and killed him. Graham was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus by arguing that the sentencing jury should have considered the mitigating circumstances of his youth and troubled family life. The district court denied the petition, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, and a panel reversed the district court’s ruling. Upon an en banc review, the Court of Appeals vacated the panel’s decision\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWould granting Graham the writ of habeas corpus create a new constitutional rule that would require special jury instructions on the consideration of the mitigating circumstances the defense presented?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that a decision in favor of Graham would create a new constitutional rule by extending beyond the reasoning of the precedents that were in place at the time of the conviction. Unless a jurist at the time of Graham’s conviction could have found reasonable precedent to decide the case in his favor, to do so now would extend beyond the Court’s purview. Since the precedent at the time would not have provided a valid reason to overturn Graham’s sentence, the Court found that it must uphold it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he fully supported the Court’s decision. He also wrote that the case Graham chiefly relied on, Penry v. Lynaugh, was wrongly decided. He argued that the specific questions a sentencing jury is asked to consider before sentencing a defendant to death make the consideration of mitigating factors redundant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent where he argued that the consideration of mitigating factors by a sentencing jury is a crucial safeguard against discriminatory sentencing. He strongly disagreed with Justice Clarence’s view that Penry v. Lynaugh was wrongly decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice David H. Souter argued that a decision in favor of Graham would not create a new constitutional rule in this case because such a decision would not impose a new burden on the prosecution in sentencing hearings. He also found that the jury instructions did not allow the jury to fully consider the implications of mitigating factors. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36803,"name":"Michael E.

Some of those statements had been made before he was given his Miranda warnings and others, while made after the Miranda warnings had been given, were the direct product of those earlier, un- Mirandized statements and should also be excluded, he argued. The state trial court (and subsequently the appeals court) disagreed, and Williams was convicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal District Court, arguing only that the claims made before the Miranda warnings were given should have been excluded. The court agreed but went further, ruling that the statements made \u003cem\u003eafter\u003c/em\u003e the Miranda warnings were inadmissible as well because they were the products of the earlier, un-Mirandized statements. On appeal, the state argued that the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in \u003cem\u003eStone v. Powell\u003c/em\u003e, 428 U.S. 465, which barred federal habeas corpus review of Fourth Amendment unreasonable search and seizure claims when the state had already given defendants a fair chance to raise such claims in state court, should also apply to questions regarding Fifth Amendment claims stemming from a failure to give Miranda warnings in a timely manner.

Souter, the Supreme Court held that the decision in Stone had been one of prudence rather than one of jurisdiction. In Stone, the Court had decided against using the \"exclusionary rule\" in federal habeas cases dealing with unreasonable searches and seizures (the exclusionary rule prevents evidence discovered as the result of an unconstitutional search from being introduced in Court). The Court\u0027s decision had been based on an expectation that, even in the unlikely case that a state court had erred in its consideration of the constitutionality of a given search, that procedural error was not likely to produce a wrongful conviction. In Fifth Amendment involuntary testimony cases, though, it was possible that a suspect would given false statements about his own guilt because of confusion or fear.

North Carolina submitted a second plan creating two black-majority districts. One of these districts was, in parts, no wider than the interstate road along which it stretched. Five North Carolina residents challenged the constitutionality of this unusually shaped district, alleging that its only purpose was to secure the election of additional black representatives. After a three-judge District Court ruled that they failed to state a constitutional claim, the residents appealed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the North Carolina residents\u0027 claim, that the State created a racially gerrymandered district, raise a valid constitutional issue under the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that although North Carolina\u0027s reapportionment plan was racially neutral on its face, the resulting district shape was bizarre enough to suggest that it constituted an effort to separate voters into different districts based on race. The unusual district, while perhaps created by noble intentions, seemed to exceed what was reasonably necessary to avoid racial imbalances. After concluding that the residents\u0027 claim did give rise to an equal protection challenge, the Court remanded - adding that in the absence of contradictory evidence, the District Court would have to decide whether or not some compelling governmental interest justified North Carolina\u0027s plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39164,"name":"Robinson O.

The employees of the Harris County Sheriff’s Department had a union representative who dealt with workers\u0027 compensation and filing grievances, but Texas law prohibited collective bargaining agreements.  Each employee had an individual employment agreement with the Sheriff’s Department. These agreements provided that employees would receive 1 ½ hours of compensatory time for each hour of overtime work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynwood Moreau, president of the union, sued the Sheriff’s Department for giving compensatory time instead of overtime pay.  He argued that where there is a designated union representative, the FLSA requires a collective bargaining agreement to authorize this kind of compensation.  The Sheriff’s Department argued that, because Texas prohibited collective bargaining agreements, there was no properly designated union representative, and the individual employment agreements were effective.  The district court ruled in favor of the Sheriff’s Office and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the Sheriff’s department take advantage of the compensatory time exception from the FLSA absent a collective bargaining agreement in a state that prohibits collective bargaining agreements, but employees have a union representative for other purposes?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion affirming the lower court.

He was subsequently convicted of aggravated battery in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County. According to Wisconsin statute, Mitchell\u0027s sentence was increased, because the court found that he had selected his victim based on race. Mitchell challenged the constitutionality of the increase in his penalty, but the Wisconsin Court of Appeals rejected his claims. However, the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the increase in Mitchell\u0027s sentence based on his bigoted motives violate his First Amendment rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court found that the Wisconsin statute paralleled antidiscrimination laws which had been found to comply with the First Amendment. It also determined that the consequences for the victim and the community tended to be more severe, when the victim of a crime was chosen on account of his or her race. Thus, when the Wisconsin statute increased the sentence for such crimes, it was not punishing the defendant for his or her bigoted beliefs or statements, but rather the predicted ramifications of his or her crime. Finally, the Court concluded that the Wisconsin statute did not violate the right to free speech because the occasion in which an average person\u0027s racist comments would be used against him or her in a court of law would arise so rarely that he or she would not feel forced to suppress them.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30018,"name":"James E.

The Center Moriches School District, acting under the statute, prohibited the use of its property by any religious group. The District refused repeated requests by Lamb\u0027s Chapel to use the school\u0027s facilities for an after-hours religious-oriented film series on family values and child rearing. The Chapel brought suit against the School District in federal court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the District violate the First Amendment\u0027s freedom of speech when it denied Lamb\u0027s Chapel the use of school premises to show religious-oriented films?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, by a unaminous vote. The Supreme Court\u0027s holding consisted of two parts. First, the District violated freedom of speech by refusing the Chapel\u0027s request to show movies on school premises solely because such movies were religiously oriented. While non-public schools are permitted under New York law to restrict access to their premises based on subject matter or speaker identity, such restrictions must be reasonable and \"viewpoint neutral.\" In this case, the District\u0027s restriction was neither reasonable nor viewpoint neutral, since it allowed the presentation of all other views about family values and child rearing - except those which were presented from a religious perspective. Second, a grant of permission to the Chapel to use the District\u0027s premises would not have amounted to an establishment of religion. This is because the showing of the films would neither be school-sponsored during school hours nor closed to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33043,"name":"Jay Alan Sekulow","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jay_alan_sekulow","view_count":0,"last_name":"Sekulow","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jay_alan_sekulow"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15839"},{"advocate":{"ID":30846,"name":"John W.

The shootings led to a massive hunt for the killer across the Valley. The police arrested Leonel Herrera on October 4, 1981 near Edinburg and took him to the police station. During a heated exchange, Herrera struck a police officer and was restrained. When defense counsel arrived several hours later, Herrera was badly beaten, unconscious, and partly paralyzed; he was subsequently transported to a hospital emergency room. Officer Carrisalez died soon thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police discovered evidence at the scene of arrest implicating Herrera in both murders. The car pulled over by Carrisalez was registered in the name of Herrera’s live-in girlfriend, and Herrera had a set of keys to that car when he was arrested. The police found drops of Type A blood on jeans recovered from a laundry room and in Herrera’s wallet. They also found a letter in Herrera’s pocket with Herrera’s fingerprints; the letter contained apparent confessions to both murders. Hernandez could not specifically identify Herrera from an array of six photographs, but later identified him as the shooter when presented with a mug shot. Herrera was convicted of the murder of Officer Carrisalez, and pleaded guilty to the murder of Trooper Rucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerrera filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, claiming actual innocence and alleging that various Valley police officials were involved in the drug trade and were working with the person actually responsible for the murders, Raul Herrera. The trial court denied relief. Herrera filed another petition, presenting the affidavit of Raul Herrera’s son that he witnessed the killings and that Herrera did not commit them. The district court dismissed most of Herrera’s claims, but granted a stay of execution as to his claim of innocence. The Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, vacated the stay of execution, agreeing with Texas that innocence was irrelevant to Herrera’s petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas an individual sentenced to death for murder, Leonel Herrera, entitled to federal habeas corpus relief under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when his petition was based on a claim of actual innocence without an accompanying federal constitutional violation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Court held that the rejection of Herrera’s petition did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Chief Justice Rehnquist concluded that evidence of Herrera’s actual innocence was not relevant to his petition for a writ of habeas corpus absent some constitutional violation by the state of Texas. This rule was grounded in the principle that federal habeas courts existed to ensure that individuals were not unconstitutionally imprisoned, not to correct errors of fact. Chief Justice Rehnquist acknowledged that the Court sometimes examined the sufficiency of evidence in death penalty cases, but only to determine whether there was an independent constitutional violation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Rehnquist also rejected Herrera’s argument that the federal courts’ failure to accept Herrera’s petition violated his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Rehnquist outlined the history of American principles of justice in criminal trials, determining that Texas’ refusal to entertain Herrera’s newly discovered evidence did not violate traditional notions of fundamental fairness. Moreover, Herrera could still avail himself of Texas’ procedures for requesting clemency. Chief Justice Rehnquist also questioned the evidentiary value of Herrera’s affidavits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor concurred, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy. She rejected the notion that the question before the Court was whether a state may constitutionally execute an innocent person, and emphasized that the evidence strongly suggested Herrera’s guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia concurred, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. He argued that there was no basis in text, tradition, or contemporary practice for finding a constitutional right to demand consideration of new evidence of innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White concurred, arguing that Herrera would only be entitled to relief if he proved that no rational trier of fact could find proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry Blackmun dissented, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter. He wrote that executing an innocent person was contrary to contemporary standards of decency. Justice Blackmun argued that Herrera should have been granted relief if he showed both a reasonable doubt about his guilt and that he was actually innocent. He also expressed doubts about the constitutionality of the death penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42621,"name":"Talbot D\u0027Alemberte","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/talbot_dalemberte","view_count":0,"last_name":"D\u0027Alemberte","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"talbot_dalemberte"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15852"},{"advocate":{"ID":35863,"name":"Margaret P.

They had an agreement with the manufacturer to be one of five regional distributors.  Gradually, the manufacturer began to take away the McQuillan’s right to distribute certain types of products, eventually revoking their rights altogether.  The manufacturer only allowed one national distributor, Spectrum Sports, Inc., which was co-owned by the president of the manufacturer’s son.  When the McQuillan’s business failed, they sued Spectrum for violations of the Sherman Act.  The Sherman Act makes it a felony to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize any part of the interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court instructed the jury to infer specific intent and dangerous probability of monopolization if they found that Spectrum engaged in predatory conduct.  The jury found Spectrum guilty.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that there was enough evidence to show specific intent and a dangerous probability of monopolization even if the jury only considered Spectrum’s predatory conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Spectrum liable for Sherman Act violations where the jury inferred intent and a dangerous possibility of success from Spectrum’s predatory conduct?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a unanimous decision, Justice Byron R. White wrote the opinion of the court reversing the lower judgment.  The Supreme Court held that Spectrum is not liable without proof of a dangerous probability of monopolization and specific intent.  The Court held that although predatory conduct may be enough to prove intent, a dangerous probability of monopolization requires an analysis of the product involved, and the offender’s power in its geographic market.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33352,"name":"James D.

Santeria used animal sacrifice as a form of worship in which an animal\u0027s carotid arteries would be cut and, except during healing and death rights, the animal would be eaten. Shortly after the announcement of the establishment of a Santeria church in Hialeah, Florida, the city council adopted several ordinances addressing religious sacrifice. The ordinances prohibited possession of animals for sacrifice or slaughter, with specific exemptions for state-licensed activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the city of Hialeah\u0027s ordinance, prohibiting ritual animal sacrifices, violate the First Amendment\u0027s Free Exercise Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that the ordinances were neither neutral nor generally applicable. The ordinances had to be justified by a compelling governmental interest and they had to be narrowly tailored to that interest. The core failure of the ordinances were that they applied exclusively to the church. The ordinances singled out the activities of the Santeria faith and suppressed more religious conduct than was necessary to achieve their stated ends. Only conduct tied to religious belief was burdened. The ordinances targeted religious behavior, therefore they failed to survive the rigors of strict scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39337,"name":"Richard G.

During his trial, he testified that the shooting was an accident. In addition to presenting other evidence, the prosecution pointed out his silence (both prior to his receiving the Miranda warnings and after) in an attempt to discredit his testimony. Brecht was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrecht appealed, claiming that the prosecution\u0027s reference to his post-Miranda silence violated his right to due process according to \u003cem\u003eDoyle v. Ohio\u003c/em\u003e. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals overturned the conviction, but the Supreme Court of Wisconsin reinstated it. They found that the mention of post-Miranda silence was impermissible under \u003cem\u003eDoyle\u003c/em\u003e, but was also harmless error according to the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard from \u003cem\u003eChapman v. California\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrecht sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. The District Court upheld his \u003cem\u003eDoyle\u003c/em\u003e claim and found that the violation was not harmless error under \u003cem\u003eChapman\u003c/em\u003e. Brecht\u0027s conviction was thus overturned again, only to be reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seventh Circuit held that \u003cem\u003eChapman\u003c/em\u003e was not the appropriate standard under which to review \u003cem\u003eDoyle\u003c/em\u003e error in federal habeas petitions. Rather than adhering to the \u003cem\u003eChapman\u003c/em\u003e standard, the court applied the \u003cem\u003eKotteakos v. United States\u003c/em\u003e test, which requires that the \u003cem\u003eDoyle\u003c/em\u003e error have a \"substantial and injurious effect\" on the jury\u0027s verdict. Brecht\u0027s \u003cem\u003eDoyle\u003c/em\u003e claim did not meet this standard, and the Seventh Circuit denied the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard from \u003cem\u003eChapman v. California\u003c/em\u003e the appropriate standard for setting aside a conviction on the basis of constitutional error?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that the \"substantial and injurious effect\" test was preferable to the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" test in requests for habeas corpus relief. Habeas proceedings are not to be the primary avenue for resolving disputes; Rehnquist called the writ \"an extraordinary remedy\", reserved for the victims of grave injustice. The Kotteakos standard, then, was sufficient to determine whether Brecht deserved habeas relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44087,"name":"William P.

McKinney shared a cell with a man who smoked five packs of cigarettes a day. He claimed that his health - both current and future - was being harmed by the smoke, and that the prison officials were \"deliberately indifferent\" to the risk in violation of the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in \u003cem\u003eWilson v. Seiter\u003c/em\u003e, 501 U.S. 294. After a federal magistrate ruled that he did not have an Eighth Amendment right to a smoke-free environment and that he had failed to prove any \"serious medical needs,\" the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that he should have been given another opportunity to prove that the smoke levels were sufficient to constitute an unreasonable danger to his future health.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay an inmate sue to prove that his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment has been violated by prison officials who act with \"deliberate indifference\" to the future health risks associated with second-hand smoke?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-to-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that McKinney\u0027s suit stated a reasonable claim that, if proven, could be grounds for relief under the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Byron White, in the majority opinion, rejected the government\u0027s argument that the \"deliberate indifference\" test established by the Court in \u003cem\u003eWilson\u003c/em\u003e (which held that withholding medical care from prisoners only violated the Eighth Amendment if it was done with \"deliberate indifference\" to serious health risks) only applied to current medical conditions. If McKinney could prove that the second-hand smoke posed a serious threat to his future health and that the prison officials had deliberately ignored that threat, White wrote, McKinney would be entitled to relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24462,"name":"Frankie Sue Del Papa","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/frankie_sue_del_papa","view_count":0,"last_name":"Del Papa","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"frankie_sue_del_papa"},"advocate_description":"Argued the case for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15871"},{"advocate":{"ID":19186,"name":"Cornish F.

On April 4, 1989, the Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America, an association of individuals and companies that worked in construction in Jacksonville, filed an action against the city and its mayor in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, claiming that the ordinance violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court ruled in favor of the association, but when the city appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. The appellate court held that the association lacked standing to file the action because it did not demonstrate that one or more of its members would have received a reserved city contract but for the ordinance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn order to have standing to challenge the Jacksonville, Florida ordinance favoring minority-owned businesses, must an association of contractors demonstrate that at least one of its members would have received a city contract in the absence of the ordinance?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a majority opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court noted that, in order to file an action, the petitioner must have demonstrated that, as a result of the challenged ordinance, its members suffered injury or that injury was imminent, and that a favorable ruling could have been expected to rectify the injury. The majority determined that the association members\u0027 possible lack of fair opportunity as a consequence of the ordinance would have constituted injury. Since the association members would have competed for the reserved city contracts in the absence of the ordinance, the Court found that they did have standing and reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20514,"name":"Deborah A.

Among other things, the appellate court found that section 602(7) violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause because there was no rational basis for distinguishing between those facilities exempted by the statute and SMATV systems linking separately owned and managed buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs there a conceivable rational basis justifying the distinction between cable facilities that serve separately owned and managed buildings and those that serve one or more buildings under common ownership or management for purposes of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that section 602(7)(B)\u0027s common-ownership distinction is constitutional because the statutory classification neither proceeded along suspect lines nor infringed fundamental constitutional rights. \"As we have indicated,\" Justice Thomas concluded, \"there are plausible rationales unrelated to the use of public rights-of-way for regulating cable facilities serving separately owned and managed buildings. The assumptions underlying these rationales may be erroneous, but the very fact that they are \u0027arguable\u0027 is sufficient, on rational-basis review, to \u0027immunize\u0027 the congressional choice from constitutional challenge.\" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurring opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20695,"name":"Deborah C.

He pleaded guilty to one count of possession cocaine with intent to distribute and was sentenced to seven years in jail. The United States then filed an in rem action, seeking forfeiture of Austin’s mobile home and auto body shop under federal statutes that provide for forfeiture of property that is used or intended for use to facilitate the transportation of controlled substances, or related materials. Austin argued that forfeiture of his property would violate the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause. The district court rejected Austin’s argument and entered summary judgment in favor of the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Eighth Amendment did not apply to civil in rem actions for forfeiture of property to the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment apply to a statutory in rem forfeiture of property?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for five members of the court, reversed the Eighth Circuit and remanded. The Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment did apply because the forfeiture was a punishment for an offense and did not only serve a remedial purpose. On remand, the Eighth Circuit should consider whether the forfeiture was constitutionally “excessive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia concurred in part and concurred in the judgment, writing that the proper question for determining whether the forfeiture is excessive is whether the property had a close enough relationship to the offense, rather than how much the property is worth. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy concurred in part and concurred in the judgment, writing that the majority should not have decided whether in rem forfeitures always amount to a punishment of the owner. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas joined in Kennedy’s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35754,"name":"Miguel A.

Cardinal counterclaimed that Morton\u0027s patents were invalid. The District Court ruled that although none of Morton\u0027s patents were violated, they were both invalid. Morton appealed to the Federal Circuit Court which sustained the lower courts infringement finding but issued a per se reversal of its determination as to the validity of Morton\u0027s patents based on a practice dating back to 1987. Cardinal appealed the per se rejection of its validity counterclaim and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a federal court, with exclusive jurisdiction over all federal appeals concerning patent litigation, use its finding that a patent has not been infringed as a per se justification for upholding the validity of the disputed patents themselves?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that two questions of law do not always necessarily cancel each other out when only one is resolved. The Court observed that in matters of patent law, noninfringement and invalidity are two separate questions. Therefore, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit may find that a patent has not been infringed but it may not rely on such a determination as a per se basis for vacating a judgement holding the same patent invalid. Although the Court of Appeals\u0027 dogmatic practice existed since 1987, it was unsupported by the \"case or controversy\" requirement of Article III, and imposed undue burdens on those who remained convinced of the disputed patent\u0027s invalidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25125,"name":"Gordon R.

Subsequently, he was charged with numerous firearm and drug trafficking offenses. Federal law imposes mandatory sentence enhancement penalties, specifically 30 years for a \"machinegun\", if a defendant \"during and in relation to . . . [a] drug trafficking crime[,] uses . . . a firearm.\" A jury convicted Smith on all counts, which triggered the sentence enhancement. On appeal, Smith argued that the federal penalty for using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense covers only situations in which the firearm is used as a weapon, not as a medium of exchange. The Court of Appeals disagreed. It held that the plain language of the penalty does not require that a firearm be used as a weapon, but that it applies to any use of a gun that facilitates, in any fashion, the perpetration of a drug offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes trading a gun for drugs make a convicted defendant eligible for sentence enhancement under a federal law, which requires such treatment if the defendant \"during and in relation to . . . [a] drug trafficking crime[,] uses . . . a firearm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 decision, authored by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court ruled that a criminal who trades his or her firearm for drugs \"uses\" it \"during and in relation to . . . [a] drug trafficking crime,\" which is within the bounds of the sentence enhancement. Justice O\u0027Connor wrote that Congress intended to make the word \"use\" as broad as possible when it wrote the law. The law does not require proof that a defendant used the gun as a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25597,"name":"Gary Kollin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/gary_kollin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kollin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"gary_kollin"},"advocate_description":"By appointment of the Court, argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15928"},{"advocate":{"ID":42821,"name":"Thomas G.

Dixon was arrested on second-degree murder charges and released on bond with an order not to commit any criminal offense.  Violation of the order would result in prosecution for contempt of court.  While awaiting trial, Dixon was arrested for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  The Superior Court of the District of Columbia found Dixon guilty of contempt.  Dixon moved to dismiss a subsequent indictment for cocaine possession, arguing that it violated the Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy.  The Superior Court granted the motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Foster’s wife obtained a civil protection order requiring that he not “molest, assault, or in any manner threaten or physically abuse” her, or he would face prosecution for contempt of court.  Foster’s wife later moved to have him held in contempt for threatening her.  Foster was found guilty of contempt on two occasions, but acquitted on three others.  Foster was later indicted on several counts of assault arising out of those same threats.  He moved to have the charges dismissed arguing that it violated double jeopardy.  The trial court denied the motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit consolidated the two cases, holding that the subsequent prosecutions were barred by \u003ci\u003eGrady v. Corbin\u003c/i\u003e, which held that subsequent prosecutions violate the double jeopardy clause if the two prosecutions require proof of the same “essential element.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Double Jeopardy Clause bar prosecution of a defendant on substantive criminal charges based on the same conduct for which the defendant previously has been held in contempt of court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the judgment of the court.  Though not agreeing on an opinion, five justices agreed that the proper test was whether the offense in the second prosecution contained the same elements as the offense in the first.  Five justices also agreed that double jeopardy did not bar the subsequent prosecutions in either case.  Justice Scalia noted that \u003ci\u003eGrady\u003c/i\u003e was wrongly decided and must be overruled.  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, and Justice Clarence Thomas joined in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Rehnquist concurred in part and dissented in part, writing that the subsequent prosecutions did not violate double jeopardy under the same elements test.  Justice O’Connor and Justice Thomas joined in the opinion.  Justice Byron R. White concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that double jeopardy bars prosecution for an offense if the accused has already been held in contempt for its commission.  Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice David H. Souter joined in the opinion.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, writing that none of the subsequent prosecutions were barred because the interests served by contempt proceedings were fundamentally different from the interests served by criminal prosecution.  Justice Souter concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the same elements test was inadequate and \u003ci\u003eGrady\u003c/i\u003e had been correctly decided.

A few weeks later, Johnson was arrested for a subsequent robbery and attempted murder. At that time he confessed to the murder of Jack Huddleston. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson was tried and convicted of capital murder. After a jury determined that he was guilty, a separate proceeding was held to determine whether Johnson would be sentenced to death or to life in prison. Pursuant to the Texas capital sentencing statute, the court instructed the jury to determine two special issues, whether Johnson caused the death of Jack Huddleston intentionally and whether Johnson was likely to constitute a continuing threat to society. Under Texas law, if the jury answered yes to both questions Johnson would be sentenced to death. The court further instructed the jury that it may consider any aggravating or mitigating evidence. However, the jury was given no special instruction to consider Johnson\u0027s youth. A unanimous jury found that the answer to both special issues was yes, and the trial court sentenced Johnson to death. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson appealed, and the appellate court affirmed the conviction. Johnson later filed a motion for rehearing arguing that the special issues did not allow for adequate consideration of Johnson\u0027s youth. The court of appeals rejected Johnson\u0027s argument concluding that the jury was able to express a reasoned and moral response to Johnson\u0027s mitigating evidence. Johnson then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Texas capital sentencing statute unconstitutionally preclude the jury from fully considering the mitigating effect of the petitioner\u0027s youth at the time of the crime? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority and held that the procedure set forth by the Texas capital sentencing statute was constitutional with respect to the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. After a lengthy discussion of past decisions regarding the constitutional requirements regarding the consideration of mitigating circumstances in capital cases, the Court ultimately held that the Texas capital sentencing statute allowed adequate consideration of Johnson\u0027s youth because the jury was instructed to determine the probability that the petitioner would be a continuing threat to society and to consider any mitigating evidence with which they were presented. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia filed a concurring opinion. He emphasized that the sentencer\u0027s consideration of relevant mitigating evidence ought to be channeled. He stated that the kind of channeling of mitigating discretion practiced in Texas should not merely be permitted, but required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas also filed a concurring opinion in which he agreed with the ruling, but added that he believed the Court wrongly decided \u003ci\u003ePenry v. Lynaugh\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor dissented, joined by Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and David Souter. In her opinion, Justice O\u0027Connor stated that the jury was not allowed to give full effect to the mitigating evidence of Johnson\u0027s youth and stated that the sentence should have been remanded. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36803,"name":"Michael E.

W. Bush in 1992, the Coast Guard was required to force the return of all passengers discovered illegally traveling by sea from Haiti to the United States before reaching its borders without determining whether they qualify as refugees. The Haitian Centers Council, Inc., a collection of organizations representing illegal Haitian aliens and Haitians detained at Guantanamo, requested that the District Court for the Eastern District of New York delay the implementation of the order. The council argued that the order violated section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and Article 33 of the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees which protect individuals escaping potential prosecution from forced repatriation. The District Court denied the council\u0027s request, but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Executive Order No. 12807 a violation of section 243(h) or Article 33?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a majority opinion authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court observed that Acts of Congress do not generally have application outside of United States territory, unless explicitly noted. And, it found that both section 243(h) and Article 33 are silent regarding extraterritorial application. In fact, the language of both suggests that only individuals who have already arrived on United States soil are protected, and their use throughout history confirms this interpretation. Thus, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36325,"name":"Maureen E.

He was charged with violating federal obscenity laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The federal District Court in Minnesota found him guilty of both charges. The court ordered him to forfeit his businesses, sentenced him to a six-year prison term, and fined him $100,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander appealed, claiming that the confiscation of his stores for his dealings in obscene material amounted to \u0027prior restraint\u0027 on his subsequent distribution of adult materials, and therefore violated his First Amendment rights. He also claimed that the seizure of his business violated his Eighth Amendment protection against excessive fines. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u0027s judgment on the First Amendment claim, and declined to review the Eighth Amendment claim on the ground that no sentence less severe than life imprisonment without parole could justify an Eighth Amendment review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes property forfeiture under RICO as punishment for the distribution of obscene materials constitute \u0027prior restraint\u0027 on speech in violation of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes the forfeiture of a business as punishment for the sale of obscene media constitute an \u0027excessive fine\u0027?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and undecided. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for a 5-4 majority that the application of RICO in Alexander\u0027s case was neither a \u0027prior restraint\u0027 on speech, nor a criminalization of speech typically protected under the Constitution. His sentence established no conditions on his behavior after its completion; once he paid the fine, surrendered his business and went to prison, he could theoretically distribute adult media without prejudice from the government. \"To accept petitioner\u0027s argument,\" Rehnquist wrote, \"would virtually obliterate the distinction [...] between prior restraints and subsequent punishments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a separate and unanimous vote, the Court ruled that the forfeiture did in fact merit Eighth Amendment review. The case was returned to the Eighth Circuit for an analysis under the Excessive Fines Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33983,"name":"Kenneth W.

The House of Representatives voted three articles of impeachment; impeachment in the Senate followed. In accordance with Senate Rule XI, a Senate committee heard the evidence and reported its findings. The full Senate convicted Nixon and sought to remove him from office. Nixon challenged Senate Rule XI in federal court on the ground that the rule violated the impeachment clause of the Constitution, which declares that \"the Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\" The lower courts deemed the issue nonjusticiable and declined to intervene in the dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Nixon\u0027s claim -- that Senate Rule XI violates the Impeachment Trial Clause -- justiciable, i.e., appropriate for judicial resolution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. A unanimous Court held that the question of whether or not the Senate rule violated the U.S. Constitution was nonjusticiable since the Impeachment clause expressly granted that the \"Senate shall have sole Power to try any impeachments.\" The clause laid out specific regulations that were to be followed and as long as those guidelines were observed the courts would not rule upon the validity of other Senate procedures regarding impeachments. Chief Justice William Rehnquist observed that while the Supreme Court was the \"ultimate intrepreter of the Constitution,\" a matter would be deemed nonjusticiable when there was \"a constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33983,"name":"Kenneth W.
