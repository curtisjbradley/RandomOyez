Maxwell was arrested and charged with raping a woman in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The jury convicted him of rape but did not render a verdict of life imprisonment. Accordingly, the trial court imposed the death penalty, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed. Maxwell sought a writ of habeas corpus in the district court and claimed that his conviction and punishment were unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the jury had determined the guilt and the penalty in a single proceeding. Additionally, he argued that the jury was not given any standards or direction regarding the imposition of the death penalty or life imprisonment. The district court denied the writ, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the denial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the imposition of the death penalty violate the defendant\u0027s right to due process when guilt and punishment are determined in a single proceeding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the imposition of the death penalty violate the defendant\u0027s right to due process when the jury was not given standards or directions on whether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. In a per curiam opinion, the 7-1 majority held that the case should be remanded to the district court for consideration of whether the defendant\u0027s due process rights were violated. The Court compared the treatment of the jurors in this case to that in \u003cem\u003eWitherspoon v. Illinois \u003c/em\u003e, a case in which the Court held the jury selection process violated the right to due process because some potential jurors were excluded from the jury simply for voicing general objections to, or religious beliefs against the death penalty. A potential jury member must have the ability to follow the instructions of the trial judge and consider all possible penalties. The Court held that further hearing on this matter was necessary before any further action could be taken, and that a local court would be better equipped to handle these issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that potential jury members who are opposed to capital punishment may be properly disqualified from the jury in a capital case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14895,"title":"Oral Argument - March 04, 1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14895"},{"id":15365,"title":"Oral Reargument - May 04, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15365"}],"citation":{"volume":"398","page":"262","year":"1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26419"},"decisions":[{"description":"The jury selection process violated the right to due process because some potential jurors were excluded from the jury simply for voicing general objections to, or religious beliefs against, the death penalty","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Johnson at Central Texas College in Killeen, Texas. After being attacked by the gathered crowd, the Protestors were arrested and charged with disturbing the peace. The Protestors sued and asked that a three-judge panel be convened in the district court to overrule the disturbing-the-peace statute since it violated their First Amendment rights. That court found the statute unconstitutional but stayed the injunction that would prevent enforcement of the statute until the next session of the Texas legislature, so that the legislature might enact a constitutionally permissible statute. However, the Texas legislature did not enact a new statute at its next session, and the court took no further action. Lester Gunn, the local sheriff, appealed directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. Gunn based his appeal on the Three-Judge Court Act, which allows direct appeals to the Supreme Court from orders granting or denying an injunction by a federal court of three judges.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Three-Judge Court Act allow direct appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States when the a district court does not specifically grant or deny an injunction?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart wrote the opinion for the 8-0 majority. The Court held that, since a clear and specific injunction is vital when a federal court is asked to nullify a law enacted by a state, it is also vital for direct Supreme Court jurisdiction under the Three-Judge Court Act. Without a specific order granting or denying an injunction, it is impossible to know with certainty what a district had decided, and thus the Court’s jurisdiction must be narrowly construed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that the opinion of the district court should be considered a declaratory judgment invalidating the Texas statute. While he agreed that the Three-Judge Court Act did not provide jurisdiction, Justice White noted that Gunn was still entitled to have the opinion reviewed by an appellate court. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun took no part in the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21137,"name":"David W.

The prosecution presented 20 witnesses who described Evans’ participation in the murder.  A prison inmate testified that one of Evans’ conspirators in the murder said “we wouldn’t be in this now” if it weren’t for Evans.  Evans’ counsel questioned the inmate, but still argued that Evans’ right to confrontation was violated because they could not confront the conspirator.  The judge overruled Evans’ objection citing a Georgia statute that allows admission of conspirator’s statements against co-conspirators.  The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  The district court denied the writ, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Georgia statute violates Evans right to confrontation because it is broader than the rule used in federal conspiracy trials.  The court found no “cogent reasons” for the Georgia hearsay exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid admitting the prison inmate’s statement under the Georgia hearsay exception violate the Sixth Amendment\u0027s Confrontation Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a four justice plurality, delivered the judgment of the court.  The Supreme Court held that the Georgia hearsay exception did not violate the confrontation clause merely because it was slightly different from the federal rule.  The accomplice’s statement was not crucial in light of the other evidence, and Evans’ counsel had full opportunity to cross-examine all of the prosecution’s witnesses.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun concurred, adding that admission of the accomplice’s statement was a harmless error if it was an error at all.  Justice John M. Harlan concurred in the result, writing that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the proper standard for reviewing rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented, arguing that admitting the accomplice’s statement denied Evans his right to cross-examine all witnesses against him.  Even if the statement fell within a genuine hearsay exception, it should not be introduced unless the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.  Justices Hugo L. Black, William O. Douglas, and William J. Brennan joined in the dissent. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15888,"name":"Alfred L.

After searching for some time, the agents asked Colonnade’s president, Salvatore E. Rozzo, to unlock a locked liquor storeroom. Rozzo refused and asked the agents if they had a search warrant. The agents responded that they did not need one. When Rozzo continued to refuse to unlock the storeroom, the agents broke the lock, entered the storeroom, and seized 53 bottles of liquor and two funnels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Colonnade moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the warrantless search and argued that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted the motion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decision and held that the Fourth Amendment does not forbid warrantless administrative inspections. Therefore, the statutes, which authorize federal agents to enter any building or place where objects subject to a liquor tax are kept “so far as it may be necessary” in order to examine them during the day or business hours, do not violate the Fourth Amendment. The appellate court also found that the statutory provisions were equivalent to a warrant given their clarity and narrow scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre warrantless administrative searches and seizures of liquor allowed under statute and, if so, reasonable under the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion for the 5-3 majority. The Court argued that business owners have a constitutional right to go about their business without unreasonable official entries onto their property. However, emphasizing a long history of liquor industry regulation, the Court stated that Congress has broad powers to fashion standards for reasonable searches of licensee’s businesses. The Court did not find the statute unconstitutional, but interpreted the statute’s imposition of a $500 fine on licensed liquor dealers who refuse to permit federal agents to inspect their liquor to mean that the fine was the only remedy available to the government upon a licensee’s refusal to grant entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the term “so far as it may be necessary” authorized the search and that the statutory penalty was enacted merely to encourage compliance by licensed liquor dealers. Because Congress could not have intended to allow licensed liquor to avoid confiscation of their liquor for a relatively small $500 fine, the fine does not mean that liquor dealers can opt out of the statutory inspection. Justice Hugo L. Black and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Hugo L. Black wrote that the statutes do not expressly declare forcible search and seizure illegal and thus implicitly authorized the seizure in this case. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the separate dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37550,"name":"O.

Williams was convicted for theft of credit cards, checks, and papers worth less than $150. He received the maximum sentence for petty theft in Illinois: one year of imprisonment and a $500 fine. If Williams was unable to pay the fine (and an additional $5 in court costs) at the end of his sentence, he would remain in jail to “work off” the fine at a rate of $5 per day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile in jail, Williams petitioned the trial court to vacate the “work off” provision of his sentence. Williams argued that he did not have any money or property with which to pay the money portion of his sentence, but he would pay if released after one year and allowed to get a job. The trial court held that Williams’ ability to pay might change by the end of his sentence and dismissed his petition. Williams appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Illinois and argued that the denial of his petition violated his right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that there was no Fourteenth Amendment violation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment violated when an impoverished defendant is imprisoned to satisfy payment of a fine and court costs?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that the Illinois law was impermissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Equal Protection Clause because the latter ruling would place a substantial burden on states to create a system of individualized fines. Additionally, the Equal Protection clause allowed judges to substitute their opinions for those of the legislature, while the Due Process Clause placed legislation that deprives an individual of his right to remain free under higher judicial scrutiny. Justice Harlan determined that the state interests in forcing someone without assets to “work off” their fines as opposed to using a payment plan or other alternative are administrative convenience and better crime deterrence, but that these interests cannot justify depriving poor individuals of their liberty.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40993,"name":"Stanley A.

Under the program, each state computes a \"standard of need\" for each family. In Maryland, the standard of need increased with each additional member of the family, but became incrementally smaller, with an upper limit of $250 per month. Linda Williams, a single mother, and Junius and Jeanette Gary, husband and wife, were Baltimore residents and parents of eight children each. They objected to Maryland\u0027s means of calculating standard of need on the ground that it discriminated against larger families, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. They also argued that the calculation conflicted with the stated purpose of the program as laid out by the Social Security Act. They filed suit against Edmund P. Dandridge, Chairman of the Maryland State Board of Public Welfare, and several other state officials. A U.S. District Court originally ruled the Maryland regulation violated both the Social Security Act and the Equal Protection Clause. On reconsideration, the court altered its ruling and based its judgment entirely on constitutional grounds but nonetheless struck down the provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Maryland mechanism for computing standard of need violate either the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Social Security Act of 1935?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-3 opinion authored by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court concluded that the Maryland provision violated neither the Social Security Act nor the Equal Protection Clause. Relying on the precedent set in \u003cem\u003eKing v. Smith\u003c/em\u003e (1968), which described the program as \"a scheme of cooperative federalism\" and gave the state \"undisputed power\" to calculate standard of need, the Court concluded that \"nothing in the federal statute…forbids a State to balance the stresses that uniform insufficiency of payments would impose on all families against the greater ability of large families…to accommodate their needs to diminished per capita payments.\" Similarly, the Court rejected the families\u0027 equal protection claim, noting, \"[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not require that a State must choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.\" Thus, because Maryland\u0027s provision was \"rationally based and free from invidious discrimination,\" it was constitutionally valid. Justice Stewart took care to note that while \"claims of morality and intelligence are raised by opponents and proponents of almost every measure,\" the Court could rule a provision invalid based only on its constitutionality, not on its wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15262,"title":"Oral Argument - December 09, 1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15262"}],"citation":{"volume":"397","page":"471","year":"1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26623"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15073,"name":"Warren E.

The Court held that the purpose of the exemptions was to neither advance nor inhibit religion; no one particular church or religious group had been singled out to receive tax exempt status. Unlike direct subsidies, which would have unduly entangled the state with religion, tax exemptions created only \"minimal and remote involvement between church and state and far less than taxation of churches.\" The Court noted that \"benevolent neutrality\" toward churches and religions was \"deeply embedded in the fabric of our national life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15216,"title":"Oral Argument - November 19, 1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15216"}],"citation":{"volume":"397","page":"664","year":"1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26626"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15073,"name":"Warren E.

On August 30, 1967, the San Francisco Department of Social Services learned that Wheeler had received the proceeds from her late son\u0027s veteran insurance policy. After a county welfare supervisor called Wheeler, the Welfare Department began withholding Wheeler\u0027s welfare check pending an investigation. Wheeler requested a hearing and for the restoration of her payments until her cause could be heard. Wheeler did not get the restoration of her payments, but she ultimately prevailed in her claim and had benefits restored several months later. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWheeler along with other similarly-situated people were granted class action status, and the class claimed that California welfare termination provisions deprived the class members of their constitutional due process rights by terminating welfare benefits before having a full and adequate hearing. A three-judge District Court for the Northern District of California held that the California procedure for pre-termination review satisfied the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court reviewed the California court\u0027s opinion \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes due process permit the termination of regularly recurring welfare payments without adequate notice and without a prior hearing on the factual questions underlying the decision to cut off assistance? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court held that the California welfare termination regulations did not satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause because they did not afford recipients an evidentiary hearing or allow the recipients to offer evidence or confront opposing witnesses. The Court reversed the lower court\u0027s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Burger filed a dissenting opinion which was joined by Justice Black.

Before the hearing, DeBacker had requested a jury trial, but the judge denied the request.  The Nebraska Juvenile Court Act denies juveniles a trial by jury.  Instead of seeking review of his sentence, DeBacker flied for state habeas corpus, arguing that the juvenile court violated the Sixth Amendment when it denied him a jury trial.  The Nebraska District Court dismissed the petition and the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed.  On appeal, DeBacker argued that recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions in \u003ci\u003eDuncan v Louisiana\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eBloom v Illinois\u003c/i\u003e entitle him to a jury trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the Nebraska Juvenile Court Act, which denies juveniles a trial by jury, violate the Sixth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does a state statute requiring proof only by a preponderance of the evidence violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo answer.  In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court dismissed certiorari as improvidently granted.  DeBacker’s hearing took place before the Court decided \u003ci\u003eDuncan\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eBloom\u003c/i\u003e.  Those cases only applied prospectively, so they did not apply to DeBacker.  The Court could not answer DeBacker’s second question because he had not objected to the standard during the criminal hearing.  DeBacker also failed to show that the judge would have ruled differently under a different standard\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented, expressing that the \u003ci\u003eDuncan\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eBloom\u003c/i\u003e decisions should apply retroactively.  Justice Hugo L. Black also dissented, writing that the “prospective only application” of constitutional decisions amounted to a judicial amendment to the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45385,"name":"William G.

The city charged and convicted him in municipal court with two ordinance violations.  Based on the same acts, Waller was prosecuted and convicted in the Circuit Court of Florida for grand larceny.  On appeal, Waller argued that the municipal court and subsequent circuit court prosecutions put him in double jeopardy.  The District Court of Appeal of Florida rejected this argument and upheld the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo successive municipal and state prosecutions involving charges arising out of the same conduct violate the Fifth Amendment’s protection against double jeopardy?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for a unanimous court, vacated the circuit court conviction.  The Supreme Court held that Waller was put twice in jeopardy because the circuit court charges were based on the same acts as the municipal court charges.  State and municipal courts are part of one sovereign judicial system.  Justice Hugo L. Black concurred, but noted that state and federal governments should not be considered separate sovereignties for double jeopardy purposes.  Justice William J.

She filed for a divorce in New Haven County Superior Court. However, Boddie was not given a hearing because she had not paid the filing fee under Section 52-259 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Given her welfare status, she was unable to pay the fee. Her requests for fee waivers were also denied. Boddie and others who were denied divorces under Section 52-259 challenged the fee requirement in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. They alleged that the fee requirement violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court upheld the requirement. Boddie appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Connecticut\u0027s fee requirement for divorce filings violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 decision, the Court reversed the District Court and held the fee requirement unconstitutional. In a majority opinion authored by Justice John M. Harlan, the Court recognized the importance of \"access to the courts\" for Boddie, as state court was the only method of obtaining a divorce in Connecticut. While the Court acknowledged Connecticut\u0027s interest in conserving limited resources and preventing \"frivolous litigation,\" this interest was not a \"sufficient countervailing justification.\" Therefore, Connecticut\u0027s refusal to allow Boddie to proceed with her divorce was \"a denial of due process\" in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice William O. Douglas concurred in the result. Justice William J.

Jackson\u003c/i\u003e, which held the death penalty unconstitutional because it imposes an impermissible burden on an accused’s Fifth Amendment right to not plead guilty and Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, did not apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould \u003ci\u003eUnited States v. Jackson\u003c/i\u003e be applied retroactively to guilty pleas entered prior to that decision?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid the death penalty needlessly encourage Brady to plead guilty in violation of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for five members of the court, affirmed.  The Supreme Court held that \u003ci\u003eUnited States v. Jackson\u003c/i\u003e does not require every guilty plea to be overturned when fear of death was a factor in the plea.  The voluntariness of the plea is determined by considering all of the relevant circumstances.  While Brady may have been partially motivated by a desire to avoid the death penalty, the guilty plea was voluntarily made with the advice of competent counsel.  Justice Hugo L. Black concurred in the judgment and substantially all of the opinion, but expressed his belief that \u003ci\u003eUnited States v. Jackson\u003c/i\u003e was wrongly decided.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. concurred in the result, because there was no evidence that fear of the death penalty played a substantial role in Brady’s decision.  Justice Brennan also expressed that the court’s method of analysis was unclear.  Justice William O. Douglas and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37659,"name":"Peter J.

The ICC decided that the merger would result in savings, improved service, and more efficient use of the railroad’s facilities.  These benefits were outweighed, however, by the potential loss of jobs and lessening of competition.  The ICC later reopened its investigation, focusing on the amount of savings the merger would produce.  This time, the ICC approved the merger, concluding that the proposed savings were more important.  Several railroads filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the ICC failed to give proper weight to the decrease in competition the merger would produce.  The district court affirmed the ICC decision.  The Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the ICC’s approval of the merger improper?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed.  The Supreme Court held that substantial evidence supported the ICC’s decision.  The savings, service improvements, and conditions agreed to by the merging railroads far outweighed the loss of competition.  The court also upheld the ICC’s decision on the ratio for the exchange of stock that would take place during the merger.  Justice William O. Douglas did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39860,"name":"Richard W.

The class members alleged that they were qualified for jury service but never summoned. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief declaring that the Alabama statute governing jury selection was unconstitutional and enjoining future enforcement of the statute. The Alabama statute provided that potential jurors should be “generally reputed to be honest and intelligent” and “esteemed in the community for their integrity, good character and sound judgment.” The district court held that the Jury Commission did not follow the Alabama statute and systematically discriminated in preparing jury lists. The court ordered a new list created in compliance with the Alabama statute and constitutional principles. The court declined to invalidate the statue or compel the Governor to appoint African-Americans to the jury commission. This case was heard on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Alabama statute unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the appointment of a white only jury commission unconstitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No. Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the district court. The Supreme Court held that, while the jury commission itself discriminated against African-Americans, the Alabama statute did not. The statute made no mention of race and was capable of being applied in a non-discriminatory way. Seven justices agreed that the Governor did not need to appoint African-American jury commissioners because the class failed to prove discrimination in the selection of the existing commissioners. Justice Hugo L. Black concurred in the judgment and the opinion, but noted that the majority opinion does not imply that the U.S. Supreme Court had the power to vacate the Governor’s jury commission appointments or order him to appoint African-American commissioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented in part, arguing that, while he would not order the Governor to appoint African-American jury commissioners, the jury commission system should be struck down because it did not provide for proportional representation of the races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36990,"name":"Norman C.

The Cherokee Nation sued the State of Oklahoma and several corporations for leasing gas, oil, and mineral rights to the river beds of the Arkansas River within that land.  The Choctaw Nation was allowed to intervene to claim that the riverbeds of Arkansas River within their land grant belonged to them.   The district court ruled against the Indian Nations, holding that the land grant did not convey rights to the river beds.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the U.S. convey rights to the riverbeds of the navigable portion of the Arkansas river through treaties with the Cherokee and Choctaw nations?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for a 4-3 majority, reversed the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that the United States granted the Indian Nations rights to the riverbed of the Arkansas River where it was completely within the boundaries of the granted land and where it formed the border.  Justice William O. Douglas concurred, writing that only the continuation of discrimination would justify denying the Indian Nations their claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White dissented, stating that the United States had a policy against conveying rights to the beds of rivers, and had expressed no intention to go against that policy.  Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the dissent.  Justice John M.

O. Bacon conveyed land to the city of Macon, Georgia through a testamentary trust for the purpose of providing a park for white persons only.  The city operated the park in that manner, but after passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, people of all races were permitted to use the park.  The managers of the park attempted to have the city removed as the trustee because it could no longer legally enforce racial segregation.  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of African American citizens who intervened, holding that the public nature of the park required that it be treated as a public institution subject to the Fourteenth Amendment regardless of who owned the park.  The trustees of Bacon’s estate then moved for a ruling that the trust was unenforceable, because racial segregation was no longer permitted, so the property should revert to Bacon’s heirs.  The trial court granted the motion, holding that racial segregation was an integral part of the trust, so the court could not simply amend the trust.  The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed.\u003cbr /\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen an individual leaves land in a testamentary trust for use by whites only, are the Fourteenth Amendment rights of African Americans infringed if the court orders the land to revert back to the individual’s heirs rather than amend the trust to allow use by people of all races?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Lewis F. Black, writing for a 5-2 majority, affirmed the Georgia court.  The Supreme Court held that the Georgia court did no more than apply well-settled principles of Georgia law.  The court had no alternative but to end the trust under Georgia’s racially neutral trust laws.  There was no indication that the Georgia judges had any discriminatory intent.  The fact that the park managers and heirs may have had a discriminatory motivation in pursuing the dissolution of the trust did not create an Equal Protection Clause violation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented, arguing that Bacon’s will left all remainders and reversions to the city, not his heirs and the purpose of the will was to dedicate the land for municipal use.  Amending the trust to allow the park to be used by everyone would carry out that purpose better than allowing the land to revert to Bacon’s heirs who would close the park.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. also dissented, arguing that closing a public facility because the public authority that owned it could not keep it segregated violated the Equal Protection Clause. Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32207,"name":"James M.

Although originally offering no official notice or opportunity for hearings to those whose aid was scheduled for termination, the State of New York implemented a hearing procedure after commencement of Kelly\u0027s litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state\u0027s termination of public aid, without affording the beneficiary a hearing prior to termination, violate notions of procedural due process as set out in the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-3 decision, the Court held that states must afford public aid recipients a pre-termination evidentiary hearing before discontinuing their aid. Noting that welfare benefits are statutory entitlements, rather than \"privileges,\" the Court weighed welfare recipients\u0027 need for procedural due process against the competing considerations of the possible harm they might suffer from discontinuation and the government\u0027s interest in summary adjudication. The Court concluded that state interests in conserving administrative costs are not sufficient to override public aid recipients\u0027 interest in procedural due process. With respect to New York\u0027s newly implemented hearings, the Court found them deficient insofar as they did not permit recipients to present evidence, be heard orally in person or through counsel, or cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15313,"title":"Oral Argument - October 13, 1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15313"}],"citation":{"volume":"397","page":"254","year":"1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26731"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Webb and other commercial fishing companies owned fishing boats that, according to established custom, were manned by independently contracted captains and crew. The company that owned each vessel was responsible for equipping it and hiring a captain, who then hired a crew. At the completion of each shipping expedition, the boat docked at a fish-processing plant, where the captain and crew were paid based on the volume of their catch. There was no guarantee that they would be paid if they did not catch fish. The commercial fishing companies determined at which plants the boats would dock and generally in what areas they would fish. The captain and the crew were responsible for the day-to-day running of the boats and expeditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commercial fishing companies paid employers’ taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and claimed refunds for the taxes due on the earnings of the captains and crews. They then sued for the refunds in district court, which held that the companies were entitled to the refunds. The district court held that the captains and crews were not “employees” for the purposes of the statutes because the amount of control the companies exercised over the boats was not enough to create an employer-employee relationship. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre boat captains and crewmen in independent boats engaged in contractual agreements with commercial fishing companies “employees” of those companies under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John M. Harlan delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority. The Supreme Court held that there was no indication in the language of the statutes that Congress intended to hold maritime activities to a land-based common law standard. Rather, resorting to the common understanding of maritime jurisprudence minimizes the uncertainly in trying to apply common law to maritime practices. Under maritime standards, employees typically have much broader discretion than land-based employees, so the type of control the commercial fishing companies exercised over their boats can still constitute the type of legal relationship the statutes require.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22386,"name":"Erwin N.

Board of Education, ordered school districts across the country to desegregate “with all deliberate speed.” However, nearly fifteen years after this order, many school districts, including schools in Holmes County, Mississippi, were either still segregated or saddled with laws making it very difficult for full integration to take place. In the summer of 1969, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered an order allowing the schools in Mississippi to continue using “freedom of choice” laws, which allowed parents to choose which school their children attended. The petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on July 23, 1969. That court, in a per curiam decision, reversed the lower court, but required the school districts to create and submit alternate plans by August 27, 1969. The petitioners then appealed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the Supreme Court allow any further delay in the complete desegregation of the nations’ school?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a per curiam decision, the Supreme Court held that it was the obligation of every school district to immediately terminate any and all segregated school systems and to only operate integrated schools. Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted that the Court of Appeals should not have allowed any more motions for additional time to desegregate because, in the Court’s opinion, the standard of allowing “all deliberate speed” for desegregation was no longer constitutionally permissible.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30616,"name":"Jack Greenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_greenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_greenberg"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21679"},{"advocate":{"ID":31414,"name":"Jeris Leonard","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jeris_leonard","view_count":0,"last_name":"Leonard","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jeris_leonard"},"advocate_description":"For the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21680"},{"advocate":{"ID":17068,"name":"A.

The primary evidence against them was the identification by the victim, Casey Reynolds. He identified the pair in a police lineup at the Birmingham City Jail.  During this lineup, the police had Coleman and Stephens say certain phrases that Reynolds remembered his attackers saying.  Coleman and Stephens also did not have counsel at their preliminary hearing.  The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, rejecting augments that the lineup was so suggestive that it likely caused a misidentification, and that the preliminary hearing was a critical stage of prosecution where the defendants were entitled to the assistance of counsel.  The Supreme Court of Alabama denied review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did denying Coleman and Stephens counsel during their preliminary hearing violate the Sixth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was the police line-up so unfairly suggestive that it violated due process under the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No.  In a 5-3 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion vacating the convictions.  The Supreme Court held that Reynolds\u0027 identification of Coleman and Stephens did not stem from a prejudicial police lineup.  The Court also held that the preliminary hearing was a critical stage, so the defendants were constitutionally entitled to counsel.  The Court remanded the case to determine whether denying counsel created an unfair prejudice against the defendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a concurrence, expressing that the right to counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments rather than on the basis of holding a fair trial.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a concurrence, also expressing that the right to counsel is guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a concurrence, stating that requiring counsel for preliminary hearings might induce courts to eliminate preliminary hearings all together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a partial dissent, stating that the convictions should not be overturned unless Coleman and Stephens can show that they lost favorable testimony during the preliminary hearing that otherwise would be preserved.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a dissent, expressing that the Constitution does not guarantee assistance of counsel at a preliminary hearing.  Justice Potter Stewart wrote a separate dissent, also stating that defendants are not entitled to counsel at a preliminary hearing.  Justice Harry A.

Vale on narcotics charges.  While staking out Vale’s home, the officers saw Vale come out of the house and do what they thought was a drug deal.  The officers arrested Vale outside his home and told him they were going to search the house.  The officers did not have a search warrant.  During the search, the officers found narcotics in a back bedroom.  This evidence was admitted at Vale’s trial where he was convicted.  The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed his conviction.  The court rejected Vale’s argument that the narcotics evidence was the product of an unreasonable search and seizure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the police officer’s warrantless search of Vale’s home an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a 6-2 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that the house was not “incident to the arrest” because the arrest took place outside.  The State also failed to show evidence of an exceptional situation where a warrantless search would be acceptable.  Admitting the narcotics evidence was in error because they were the fruits of an illegal search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black dissented, arguing that a search is proper when officers reasonably believe that someone might destroy the narcotics evidence if the search were postponed to obtain a warrant.  Chief Justice Warren Burger joined in the dissent.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22180,"name":"Eberhard P.

Walsh requested and filed application for conscientious objector status. On his form, Welsh specifically indicated that his objection was not rooted in religious belief; he responded \"No\" where the questionnaire asked if he believed in a supreme being. An appeal board rejected his application. Welsh refused to appear for induction and, on June 1, 1966, was sentenced to three years imprisonment. The Court ruled in \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Seeger\u003c/em\u003e (1965) that conscientious objector status was not reserved to individuals of a traditional religious background. On appeal, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that because Welsh denied any religious foundation for his beliefs, whereas Seeger had characterized his pacifist beliefs as \"religious,\" Welsh\u0027s conviction was valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan Welsh claim conscientious objector status even though he professes no religious-based objection?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-3 plurality opinion authored by Justice Hugo L. Black, the Court declared a registrant\u0027s characterization of his beliefs as nonreligious to be \"a highly unreliable guide for those charged with administering the exemption.\" According to Justice Black, the term \"religious\" is broadly scoped, and denying conscientious objector status because of a refusal to use the term \"places undue emphasis on the registrant\u0027s interpretation of his own beliefs.\" The Court therefore reasoned that conscientious objector status applies to \"all those whose consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to become a part of an instrument of war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14958,"title":"Oral Argument - January 20, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14958"}],"citation":{"volume":"398","page":"333","year":"1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26758"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The charge also alleged that had Winship\u0027s act been done by an adult, it would constitute larceny. Relying on Section 744(b) of the New York Family Court Act, which provided that determinations of juvenile\u0027s guilt be based on a preponderance of the evidence, a Family Court found Winship guilty, despite acknowledging that the evidence did not establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Winship\u0027s appeal of the court\u0027s use of the lower \"preponderance of the evidence\" burden of proof, was rejected in both the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court and in the New York Court of Appeals before the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the requirement that juvenile convictions rest on \"preponderance of the evidence\" burden of proof, as opposed to that stricter \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" threshold, violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-3 decision, the Court found that when establishing guilt of criminal charges the strict \"reasonable-doubt\" standard must be applied to both adults and juveniles alike. The Court noted that by establishing guilt based only on a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" as is customary in civil cases, courts were denying criminal defendants a fundamental constitutional safeguard against the possibility that their fate be incorrectly decided due to fact-finding errors. The Court concluded that mere variations in age among criminal defendants will not suffice to warrant the use of different burdens of proof so long as they all face loss of liberty as a possible sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14856,"title":"Oral Argument - January 20, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14856"}],"citation":{"volume":"397","page":"358","year":"1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26760"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

During the course of the film, she takes a lover, and the film shows their explicit sex scenes, including scenes of oral sex. Suffolk County District Attorney Garrett H. Byrne determined that the film was obscene because it appealed to a “prurient interest in sex,” was offensive to community moral standards, and had no redeeming social value. He charged Karalexis with violating a state statute that prohibits the exhibition of obscene films.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaralexis sought an injunction in district court in order to prevent this prosecution and future ones under a law that he argued violated the First Amendment protection afforded to such films..The district court held that the law was likely unconstitutional and granted the injunction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan an injunction be filed to prevent the use of a state statute that prohibited showing obscene films?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a per curiam opinion that represented a 5-justice majority, the Court held that the law did not represent a threat to any constitutional rights that could not be defended in an individual court case. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. dissented. He argued that it was appropriate for Karalexis to seek federal relief from the law after he was already convicted on the obscenity charges, because clearly the trial did not defend his constitutional rights. He also argued that the district court erred by granting an injunction before the film was determined to be obscene. Justice Byron R. White and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O.

The Fifth Amendment authorized this type of taking as long as the government provided “just compensation”.  The Reynolds’ claimed that the original project did not contain 78 of the acres the United States tried to claim.  A jury awarded the Reynolds’ $20,000 as compensation for all the land taken.  On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial, finding that the jury instructions referred to matters disclosed outside the jury’s presence.  Both the trial court and the court of appeals rejected the United States’ argument that the “scope of the project” issue was a question for the judge to decide, not the jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Should a judge or the jury decide whether the 78 acres were in the initial scope of the project?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the “scope of the project” rule require the early planning stages to show specifically which land will be taken, or just a general area influenced by the planned project?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe judge should decide; general area.  In a 6-2 decision, Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion vacating the lower judgment and remanding to the district court.  The Supreme Court held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 71A(h) provides that the jury is limited to deciding amount of just compensation.  The trial judge should decide all other issues.  The Court also briefly confirmed that the scope of the project includes any land that will likely be used according to early plans.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent, stating that there is no reason to prevent the jury from deciding issues of fact, such as the scope of the project, on which its verdict will rely. Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41584,"name":"Shiro Kashiwa","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/shiro_kashiwa","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kashiwa","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"shiro_kashiwa"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21947"},{"advocate":{"ID":23135,"name":"Erwin S.
