Taxation With Representation of Washington","href":"https://api.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-2338","view_count":0,"docket_number":"81-2338","manner_of_jurisdiction":"Appeal","first_party":"Donald Regan, Secretary of the Treasury","second_party":"Taxation With Representation of Washington","timeline":[{"event":"Argued","dates":[417160800],"href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_timeline/case_timeline/34155"},{"event":"Decided","dates":[422514000],"href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_timeline/case_timeline/34156"}],"lower_court":{"ID":16,"name":"United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit","href":"https://api.oyez.org/taxonomy/term/16"},"facts_of_the_case":"\u003cp\u003eTwo non-profit groups merged to form the group Taxation With Representation of Washington (TWR). One of the original groups obtained 501(c)3 status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which allowed donors to make tax-deductible donations to it. Because the other group participated in political lobbying, it did not qualify for 501(C)(3) status and could not offer tax-deductible donations. Since the newly formed TWR also participated in \"substantial lobbying,\" the IRS denied it tax-deduction privileges. TWR alleged in District Court that the IRS\u0027s \"substantial lobbying\" restriction for 501(C)(3) status violated its First Amendment rights by imposing an \"unconstitutional burden\" on its ability to receive tax-deductible donations. TWR also argued that the restriction violated its Fifth Amendment equal protection rights since veterans\u0027 organizations that lobbied extensively could receive tax-deductible donations. The District Court dismissed the complaint but the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the \"substantial lobbying\" restriction did impair TWR\u0027s Fifth Amendment equal protection rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the IRS violate the First Amendment by denying 501(c)3 tax-deduction privileges to non-profit groups that participate in \"substantial lobbying\"? Does the IRS violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment by denying 501(c)3 tax-deduction privileges to non-profit groups that participate in \"substantial lobbying\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. Justice William H. Rehnquist authored the opinion for a unanimous court. Allowing a non-profit to solicit tax-deductible donations is a form of paying for its operations. Pointing to its decision in \u003cem\u003eCammarano v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, the Court maintained that \"Congress is not required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying.\" The federal government does not have to sponsor every activity that the First Amendment protects, and its choice to sponsor one type of activity does not force it to sponsor every related type of activity. The federal government can choose to support veterans\u0027 lobbying organizations without also having to fund the lobbying of other groups. Non-profit groups interested in offering tax-deductions to donors can separate with the parts of the organization engaged in lobbying.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39761,"name":"Rex E.

Rodgers, however, was not in debt and under Texas law, had a separate right to the homestead. The district court held Rodgers had a state-created right not to have her homestead subjected to a force sale. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes section 7403 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 grant the government the power to order the sale of a home of a delinquent taxpayer, even if a third party has interest in the home as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held section 7403 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 does grant the government power to order the sale of a home itself, even if the delinquent taxpayer is not the only one with interest in the property. However, that power is limited by equitable discretion, which means that the district court should consider a number of different variables including the possible competing prejudices and expectation of the parties involved. The Court also held that, if the home is sold, then the nondelinquent spouse is entitled to a portion of the proceeds because taking away the interest of an innocent third party would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun delivered an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he argued that the government has the power to sell property not belonging to an indebted taxpayer, but that it should be determined how far the power can extend. The government does not have the power to sell jointly owned property if the nondelinquent co-owner has a right to ban the sale and continue the possession. In this case, Rodgers had a state-protected right to remain in her home, so the government did not have the power to sell her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34387,"name":"L.

Although Lyons offered no resistance, the officers, without provocation, seized Lyons and applied a chokehold. The hold rendered Lyons unconscious and damaged his larynx. Along with damages against the officers, Lyons sought an injunction against the City barring the use of such control holds.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Lyons\u0027s injunction against the use of police chokeholds meet the threshold requirements imposed by Article III of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that federal courts were without jurisdiction to entertain Lyons\u0027 claim for injunctive relief. The fact that Lyons had been choked once did nothing to establish \"a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped. . .by an officer who would illegally choke him into unconsciousness.\" The Court held that in order to establish an actual controversy, Lyons would have to show either 1) that all Los Angeles police officers always choked citizens with whom they had encounters, or 2) that the City ordered or authorized officers to act in such a manner. Lyons was thus limited to suing the police and the city for individual damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36383,"name":"Michael R.

Exxon Corporation (Exxon), along with other gas and oil producers in Alabama, had contractual agreements regarding the tax with the owners of the land on which operations occurred and with oil and gas purchasers. The owners were paid a royalty on all gas and oil produced, but were contractually assessed a portion of the severance tax, and the purchasers were required to reimburse the producers for any severance tax paid by them. In 1979, the Alabama Legislature passed a statute altering the severance tax. The statute increased the severance tax, exempted royalty landowners from the increase, and prohibited gas and oil operators from passing the tax increase on to oil and gas purchasers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExxon and other oil and gas producers sued Ralph Eagerton, the Commissioner of Revenue in Alabama and argued that the National Gas Policy Act, which allowed natural gas producers to take steps to recoup state severance tax, preempted the prohibitions on passing along the costs to purchasers. Furthermore, the oil and gas producers argued that the exemption and the prohibition violated the oil and gas producers’ Constitutional rights under the Contract Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Circuit Court of Montgomery County ruled the new severance tax provisions unconstitutionally violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment and the Contract Clause. The state appealed to the Supreme Court of Alabama, which reversed the lower court’s decision, holding any constraints imposed by the new tax were generally applicable and therefore valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the National Gas Policy Act of 1978, preempt state regulation of oil and gas operations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the royalty owner exemption violate oil and gas operators’ rights under the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(3) Does the pass-through prohibition violate oil and gas operators’ rights under the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(4)Do the pass-through prohibition and royalty-owner exemption violate oil and gas producers’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no, no, no. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion for the unanimous court. The Court held that federal law entirely preempts state law either when Congress explicitly declares it or when federal regulation is so pervasive that it is reasonable to infer that there is no space for a state to supplant federal regulation. Specific state laws are preempted to the extent that they stand in conflict or as an obstacle to federal law. The Court held that the National Gas Policy Act preempted the pass-through prohibition as they applied to interstate transactions. The pass-through prohibition could however be applied to intrastate transactions because Congress did not intend the National Gas Policy Act to preempt state regulation of state gas and oil markets. The Court also held that the exemption for royalty landowners did not violate the Contract Clause of the Constitution, because the exemption does not prohibit land owners and oil and gas producers from contractually shifting the tax burden Additionally, the Court held that a statute does not violate the Contract Clause simply because it has an effect on contractual obligations undertaken prior to passage of a statute. Because the pass-through prohibition only created incidental effects on pre-existing contractual obligations, it was not unconstitutional. The Court also held that, the statute only had to pass rational basis review because it did not affect a fundamental interest or create a suspect categorization. Because the royalty landowner exemption and the pass-through prohibition were both rationally related to Alabama’s legitimate interest in protecting consumers from excessive prices, neither provision violated the oil and gas producers’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38944,"name":"Rae M.

This practice involves the offering of a prayer at the beginning of each legislative session by a chaplain chosen by the state and paid out of public funds. The district court supported Chambers on the use of public funds. The appeals court supported Chambers on the prayer practice. Both parties appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the chaplaincy practice of the Nebraska legislature violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-3 decision, the Court upheld the chaplaincy practice. In his opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger abandoned the three-part test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, which had been the touchstone for cases involving the Establishment Clause. In its place, Burger rested the Court\u0027s opinion on historical custom. Prayers by tax-supported legislative chaplains could be traced to the First Continental Congress and to the First Congress that framed the Bill of Rights. As a consequence, the chaplaincy practice had become \"part of the fabric of our society.\" In such circumstances, an invocation for Divine guidance is not an establishment of religion. \"It is,\" wrote Burger, \"simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41115,"name":"Shanler D.

The Secretary also has the ability to delegate that power to another agency, in this case the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Act also authorizes judicial review to determine whether the NHTSA acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1967, the Department of Transportation first issued Standard 208, which at that point only required all automobiles to have seat belts. By 1975, Standard 208 had been revised multiple times to require passive restraints, such as airbags and seat belts that would operate automatically and not require action on the part of the occupants. Because of the unpopularity of the standard, in 1974 Congress amended the Act to allow alternative safety measures. In 1976, Secretary of Transportation William Coleman suspended the passive restraint requirement entirely. The succeeding Secretary of Transportation, Brock Adams, issued Modified Standard 208, which required passive restraints in large cars of model year 1982 or later and in all cars of model year 1984 or later. In 1981, Secretary of Transportation Andrew Lewis began reconsidering Modified Standard 208. The NHTSA rescinded the passive restraint requirement of Modified Standard 208 because it determined that the restraints would not have the expected safety benefits, so the requirement would not be reasonable or practicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eState Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and the National Association of Independent Insurers filed for review of the NHTSA’s decision, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the NHTSA’s decision to rescind the standard was arbitrary and capricious. The Court of Appeals held that there was not enough evidence to support the NHTSA’s position and that the NHTSA failed to properly consider alternative possibilities under which the standard could be effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the NHTSA’s decision to rescind Modified Standard 208 arbitrary and capricious?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Supreme Court held that the rescission of a standard should be reviewed based on whether the decision was arbitrary or capricious. Because the removal of a standard often entails the same level of policy changes as the promulgation of a law, it should be reviewed under the same tests. The Court also held that the Court of Appeals, while correctly finding that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious, relied too strongly on an inferred congressional mandate for passive restraints. The Court held that, by rescinding Modified Standard 208 without considering alternatives and consequences, the NHTSA did not provide evidence for its decision and therefore acted arbitrarily and capriciously. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that the NHTSA did not provide adequate analysis for rescinding the requirements regarding airbags and continuous spool seat belts, but it did explain its decision in regards to detachable belts. He also argued that it is reasonable for an agency to reassess its priorities over time, as happened in this case. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the partial concurrence and partial dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34255,"name":"Lloyd N.

The company notified a narcotics agent, and further investigation determined that Armstrong had been purchasing similar chemicals from the Hawkins Chemical Company in St. Louis. With the consent of Hawkins Chemical Company, narcotics agents installed a radio transmitter in the container of chloroform that Armstrong would receive. By tracking the radio transmitter, officers were able to track Armstrong delivering the chloroform to Darryl Petschen. Petschen drove it to a cabin owned by Leroy Carlton Knotts in Shell Lake, Wisconsin. Relying on this information, the officers obtained a search warrant for the cabin and found a fully operable drug-manufacturing lab. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnotts was convicted in district court after the court denied his motion to suppress the evidence. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the conviction and held that the monitoring of the radio transmitter violated Knotts’ Fourth Amendment rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e Does police planting and tracking of a radio transmitter violate the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the use of the radio transmitter to track the movements of a suspect in a car falls under the privacy expectations for a vehicle, which are less than those of a house. Since the radio transmitter in this case was used primarily to ascertain where the chloroform traveled and where it stopped, the surveillance did not violate Knotts’ right to privacy in his home. Additionally, the use of the radio transmitter did not serve any function that the police could not have performed visually; the transmitter merely made the process easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. concurred in the judgment and wrote that, while he agreed with the majority’s decision concerning the use of the radio transmitter, he found its original installation to be on shakier constitutional ground. He argued that the installation of the radio transmitter represented a significantly larger intrusion upon a person’s privacy. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the opinion concurring in judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun also concurred in judgment and argued that the majority’s opinion unnecessarily referred to the “open fields” doctrine that was a major issues in two cases the Court had yet to hear. He wrote that he did not wish either side in those two cases to gain legitimacy from this one. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the concurrence in judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the judgment and wrote that the majority opinion’s implication that the this case involved the “open field” doctrine was false. He also argued that the use of technology to augment officers’ abilities was not always automatically constitutionally sound. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined the opinion concurring in judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36467,"name":"Mark W.

Verlindin alleged that the court had jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).  The FSIA grants jurisdiction for actions against foreign parties who are not entitled to immunity.  Central Bank moved to dismiss the case due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The district court dismissed the case, holding that Central bank had sovereign immunity.

Burger, writing for a unanimous court, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that the FSIA does not violate Article III.

He argued that Jessica was adopted by her mother’s husband in violation of the Constitution because Lehr was never notified of the proceedings.  Under New York law, Lehr was not in any of the classes of people entitled to notification of adoption proceedings.  Lehr never supported the child financially, had a significant relationship with the child, or entered his name into the state’s father registry.  The Ulster County Family Court denied Lehr’s petition and the Appellate Division and New York Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes New York law violate due process and equal protection within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment when a biological father who has no relationship with the child does not receive notice of adoption proceedings surrounding his child?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for a 6-3 majority, affirmed the New York courts.  The Supreme Court held that due process and equal protection were not violated because Lehr never had a significant personal or financial relationship with Jessica M.  Justice Byron R. White dissented, arguing that the state cannot deny notice of adoption proceedings to a biological father when the state knows his whereabouts and interest in the child.

Under Indiana law, brewers were required to sell to all Indiana wholesalers at a single price, Indiana wholesalers were prohibited from selling to out-of-state retailers, and Indiana retailers were not permitted to purchase beer from out-of-state wholesalers. Vanco filed suit, alleging that Falls City\u0027s price discrimination violated section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act. The Federal Court found that Vanco had established a prima facie case of price discrimination. The court rejected Falls City\u0027s \"meeting-competition\" defense under section 2(b) of the Clayton Act, which provides that a defendant may rebut a prima facie showing of illegal price discrimination by establishing that its lower price to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the meeting-competition defense of section 2(b) of the Clayton Act available only if the defendant sets its lower price on customer-by-customer basis and creates the price discrimination by lowering rather than by raising prices?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court held that section 2(b) is not so inflexible. The Court held that the meeting-competition defense required a seller at least to show the existence of facts that would lead a reasonable and prudent person to believe that the seller\u0027s lower price would meet the equally low price of a competitor and required the seller to demonstrate that its lower price was a good faith response to a competitor\u0027s low price. \"Falls City contends that it has established its meeting-competition defense as a matter of law. In the absence of further findings, we do not agree,\" wrote Justice Blackmun.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29652,"name":"John T.

Among other things, the ordinance required: all abortions performed after the first trimester to be done in hospitals, parental consent before the procedure could be performed on an unmarried minor, doctors to counsel prospective patients, a twenty-four hour waiting period, and that fetal remains be disposed of in a \"humane and sanitary manner.\" Some of the ordinance\u0027s provisions were invalidated by a federal district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid several provisions of the Akron ordinance violate a woman\u0027s right to an abortion as guaranteed by the Court\u0027s decision in \u003cem\u003eRoe v. Wade\u003c/em\u003e and the right-to-privacy doctrine as implied by the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court affirmed its commitment to protecting a woman\u0027s reproductive rights by invalidating the provisions of Akron\u0027s ordinance. Generally, Justice Powell\u0027s opinion reiterates the Court\u0027s findings in \u003cem\u003eRoe\u003c/em\u003e and reasons that certain provisions of the ordinance violated the Constitution because they were clearly intended to direct women away from choosing the abortion option. They were not implemented out of medical necessities. The fetal disposal clause was struck down because its language was too vague to determine conduct subject to criminal prosecution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39761,"name":"Rex E.

The Court held that when state court decisions appeared to rest primarily on federal law, it would infer that state courts believed that federal law required them to do so. State courts could expressly state that independent grounds were being used in cases as opposed to constitutional grounds. The Court reasoned that this approach would avoid the rendering of advisory opinions and would decrease the intrusive practice of requiring state courts to clarify decisions to the liking of the Justices.

The girl was in her second trimester and did not inform her parents about the procedure, despite Dr. Simopoulos’ suggestion.  Dr. Simploulous was indicted under a Virginia law prohibiting second trimester abortions outside of a licensed hospital.  The Circuit Court of Fairfax County convicted him without a jury and the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the prosecution’s failure to allege a lack of medical necessity for the abortion violate Due Process?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the prosecution fail to prove that Dr. Simploulous’ acts caused the death of the unborn fetus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(3) Is the Virginia law requiring all second trimester abortions to take place in licensed hospitals unconstitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No, No.  Justice Lewis F. Powell, writing for an 8-1 majority, affirmed the Virginia court.  The Supreme Court held that requiring doctors to perform second trimester abortions in licensed hospitals was a reasonable means of furthering the state’s interest in protecting the mother’s health and safety.  The prosecution was not required to prove a lack of medical necessity, and Dr. Simopoulos’ actions clearly caused the death of the unborn fetus.  This case is different from past cases where hospitalization requirements were unconstitutional, because the Virginia statute allows abortions in outpatient facilities as long as they are properly licensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor concurred in part and concurred in the judgment, expressing that the validity of the Virginia statute did not depend on which trimester was regulated.  The statute was not an undue burden on the decision to undergo an abortion, so it was valid.  Justice Byron R. White and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the concurrence.

Universal City Studios owned the copyrights to television programs broadcast on public airwaves. Universal sued Sony for copyright infringement, alleging that because consumers used Sony\u0027s Betamax to record Universal\u0027s copyrighted works, Sony was liable for the copyright infringement allegedly committed by those consumers in violation of the Copyright Act. Universal sought monetary damages, an equitable accounting of profits, and an injunction against the manufacturing and marketing of the VTR\u0027s. The District Court denied all relief, holding that the noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute copyright infringement. Moreover, the court concluded that Sony could not be held liable as contributory infringers even if the home use of a VTR was considered an infringing use. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held Sony liable for contributory infringement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Sony\u0027s sale of \"Betamax\" video tape recorders to the general public constitute contributory infringement of copyrighted public broadcasts under the Copyright Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that \"[t]he sale of the VTR\u0027s to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of [Universal\u0027s] copyrights.\" The Court concluded that there was a significant likelihood that a substantial number of copyright holders who license their works for free public broadcasts would not object to having their broadcasts time-shifted by private viewers and that Universal failed to show that time-shifting would cause non-minimal harm to the potential market for, or the value of, their copyrighted works. Justice Stevens wrote for the Court that \"[t]he sale of copying equipment...does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes, or, indeed, is merely capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\" For the dissenting minority, Justice Blackmun expressed the views that taping a copyrighted television program is infringement and that the recorder manufacturers were guilty of inducing and materially contributing to the infringement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41600,"name":"Stephen A.

Such behavior would lead to expulsion. In 1970, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) changed its formal policy to adopt a district court decision that prohibited the IRS from giving tax-exempt status to private schools engaging in racial discrimination. The IRS believed that the University\u0027s policies amounted to racism and revoked its tax-exempt status. The University claimed that the IRS had abridged its religious liberty. This case was decided together with Goldsboro Christian Schools Inc. v. United States, in which Goldsboro maintained a racially discriminatory admissions policy based upon its interpretation of the Bible, accepting for the most part only Caucasian students. The IRS determined that Goldsboro was not an exempt organization and hence was required to pay federal social security and unemployment taxes. After paying a portion of such taxes for certain years, Goldsboro filed a refund suit claiming that the denial of its tax-exempt status violated the U.S. Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the government prohibit race discrimination at the expense of the First Amendment\u0027s Free Exercise Clauses?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that the IRS was correct in its decision to revoke the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University and the Goldsboro Christian School. These institutions did not meet the requirement by providing \"beneficial and stabilizing influences in community life\" to be supported by taxpayers with a special tax status. The schools could not meet this requirement due to their discriminatory policies. The Court declared that racial discrimination in education violated a \"fundamental national public policy.\" The government may justify a limitation on religious liberties by showing it is necessary to accomplish an \"overriding governmental interest.\" Prohibiting racial discrimination was such a governmental interest. Hence, the Court found that \"not all burdens on religion are unconstitutional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44300,"name":"William T.

In 1974, the legislature exempted the first $100,000 worth of ink and paper consumed a year.

They relayed this information to fellow agents at his destination airport. There, the agents met him and seized his bags without his consent. Ninety minutes after the seizure, his bags were subjected to a \"sniff\" test by a drug-detection dog. The dog signaled the presence of a controlled substance in one of the bags. The agents then obtained a warrant for that suitcase, which turned out to contain cocaine, and the man was convicted of the drug offense. The Court of Appeals reversed his conviction on the ground that the ninety minutes exceeded the investigative stop permitted by _Terry v. Ohio\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, and thus violated the Fourth Amendment\u0027s search and seizure privilege.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the ninety minute seizure of the traveler\u0027s luggage a valid investigative stop under \u003cem\u003eTerry\u003c/em\u003e?

Seizures pursuant to investigative detentions are lawful only if they are limited in scope, as described in \u003cem\u003eTerry\u003c/em\u003e, and evidence resulting from such unlawful seizures must be suppressed. The \"sniff\" of a properly trained narcotics detection dog does not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29481,"name":"James Dexter Clark","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/james_dexter_clark","view_count":0,"last_name":"Clark","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"james_dexter_clark"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12709"},{"advocate":{"ID":16154,"name":"Alan I.

Barefoot guilty of the murder of a police officer. A separate sentencing hearing was held before the same jury to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed. The prosecution called two psychiatrists to the stand who testified that Barefoot was likely to commit further acts of violence and would remain a danger to society. The jury sentenced Barefoot to death. Barefoot appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and argued that the use of the psychiatrists to testify as to future conduct was unconstitutional because psychiatric testimony cannot accurately predict future dangerousness and is likely to produce erroneous convictions. He also argued that this specific testimony was unconstitutional, as neither psychiatrist had personally examined Barefoot. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarefoot’s execution was scheduled for September 7, 1980. A stay of execution was granted by the Supreme Court pending the filing and disposition of a petition of certiorari. The petition was denied, and Barefoot’s execution was rescheduled for October 1981. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Barefoot’s application for habeas corpus, and he filed a petition for habeas corpus in district court. The district court granted a stay of execution pending action on the petition, and later denied the petition and vacated the stay of execution. The district court also issued a certificate of probable cause that would allow Barefoot to continue the appeals process. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals again denied Barefoot’s petition for habeas corpus and motion for a stay of execution. Barefoot appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth District for a stay of execution, pending the consideration of his appeal of the denial of his petition for habeas corpus, and the Court of Appeals denied the motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the district court err in rejecting the habeas corpus petition on the merits?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit correctly deny a stay of execution of the death penalty pending appeal of the district court’s judgment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that, in denying the stay of execution, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit necessarily examined the decision of the district court on the merits of the case. Although the Court of Appeals may not formally affirm the judgment of the lower court, the denial of the stay of execution serves the same purpose. The Court also held that the psychiatrists’ testimony did not violate the defendant’s constitutional rights because the testimony falls under precedents that allow for predictions of future behavior to be considered relevant evidence in sentencing hearings. The reliability of such evidence should be weighed according to the rules of evidence by the fact-finder. The Court also held that the testimony of expert witnesses need not rely on personal examination and can be in the form of responses to hypothetical questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice John Paul Stevens wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he argued that the Court of Appeals made procedural errors, but that the Supreme Court reviewed the case on the merits, and he concurred with the majority’s opinion as to the merits of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent in which he argued that a defendant must be afforded a hearing on the merits of his case when he petitions for a writ of habeas corpus unless the case can be dismissed as frivolous. Because a hearing on the merits can often be time-consuming, the Court of Appeals should have granted a stay of execution to allow enough time to properly consider the case. He also argued that death penalty jurisprudence placed an added emphasis on the importance of careful consideration, and the majority opinion’s suggestion of a summary approach goes against those precedents. He also cited his opinion that the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun argued that, while the possibly specious testimony of psychiatrists would be acceptable in a regular case, in a capital case a higher standard of reliability must be expected. Because unreliable scientific evidence is likely to prejudice the jury, it must be held to a stricter standard of accuracy than psychiatric testimony can be proven to meet. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20602,"name":"Douglas M.

On March 6, he received insider information that Equity Funding of America, a corporation engaged primarily in selling life insurance and mutual funds, had vastly overstated assets as a result of fraudulent company policies. Dirks did not do any business with Equity Funding, but he decided to investigate and, during the investigation, discussed his information with investors who did hold Equity Funding stock. Some of these people sold their stock based on Dirks’ information. Dirks also urged the Wall Street Journal to publish an article on the fraud allegations, but it would not for fear of the story being libelous. The drop in Equity Funding’s share price caused the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading on March 27 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation. On April 2, the Wall Street Journal ran a story that was based largely on Dirks’ information, and the SEC then began investigating Dirks’ role in the affair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their investigation of Dirks’ actions, the SEC found that he had aided and abetted the violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by informing other members of the investment community of the fraud allegations. However, because he assisted in exposing the fraud, Dirks was only censured. Dirks appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which affirmed the SEC’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Dirks’ actions violate the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the duty to disclose information arises from a financial relationship with one of the parties, not just the possession of information. The Court also held that an insider is only liable for inside trading when he makes a profit on the information before disclosing. Because Dirks did not have a financial relationship with Equity Funding, nor did he make a profit from the information, he neither had a duty to disclose nor did he violate the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun argued that Dirks served as a proxy to provide insider information to people who did have a financial interest in Equity Funding and were able to act on his information. By fulfilling this role, he is liable. He also argued that that the majority’s opinion essentially rewards Dirks for participating in the affair, which is counterproductive for the purposes of enforcing the federal securities acts. Justice William J.

Meyers strongly opposed this transfer, and made her feelings known to several supervisors, including District Attorney Harry Connick.  Before the official transfer took place, Meyers prepared a questionnaire asking for her co-workers views on the transfer policy, office morale, and the level of confidence in supervisors.  When Connick learned of the questionnaire, he immediately terminated Meyers.  He said he fired her because she refused to accept her transfer.  He also said that distributing the questionnaire was insubordination.  Meyers sued, alleging that her termination violated her First Amendment right to free speech.  The district court ruled in favor of Meyers and ordered her reinstatement, payment of back pay, damages, and attorney fees.   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the questionnaire that Meyers distributed constitutionally-protected speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice Byron R. White wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that speech of public employees is generally only protected when they speak on matters of public concern.  Meyers’ speech only dealt with personal and internal office issues.   The district court also erred in placing too high of a burden on Connick to show that Meyers’ speech substantially interfered with the operation of the office.  It is sufficient to show that the employer reasonably believed Meyers’ speech would interfere with office operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan wrote a dissent, expressing his view that speech concerning the way government is run is protected under the First Amendment.  Meyers’ questionnaire addressed that subject and interfered with the operation of the office, so her termination violated the First Amendment.  Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, and John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26058,"name":"George M.

As part of the collective-bargaining agreement reached between PEA and the Board of Education of Perry Township, PEA obtained exclusive rights to use the internal school mail system and PLEA was denied access. PLEA contended that denying their members use of the mail system violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. A Federal District Court ruled against PLEA but the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a local school board violate the First Amendment by disallowing a nonofficial teachers union from using its internal school mail system?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron White delivered the opinion of a 5-4 court. The school board chose to grant exclusive access to the official teachers union in order to facilitate a collective-bargaining agreement. It did not act to suppress the speech of rival teachers unions. The school board entrusted PEA with obligations as the sole representative of teachers that would require the use of the mail system. PLEA did not have these obligations and could communicate effectively though many other channels. Since the mail system was not a \"public forum,\" PLEA had no unassailable right to access it. In his dissent, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. contended that the mail system constituted government property and PLEA lost access privileges because its viewpoints differed from those of the official union.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38927,"name":"Robert H.

While Stephens’ appeal was pending, the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled one of the aggravating circumstances that justify the death penalty invalid.  After exhausting all post conviction remedies, Stephens filed a writ of habeas corpus in Federal district court.  The district court denied relief, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn certiorari, the U.S. Supreme Court certified the Supreme Court of Georgia to answer the question of what state law premises support affirming Stephens death sentence, even though one of the aggravating circumstances was now invalid.  The Georgia court responded, holding that the jury used other aggravating circumstances along with the invalid one to sentence Stephens, so his sentence should stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the court grant habeas corpus to Stephens because one of the aggravating circumstances leading to his death sentence is now invalid?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 7-2 decision, Justice John Paul Stephens wrote the majority opinion reversing the court of appeals.  The Supreme Court held that where there are other valid aggravating circumstances to substantiate the death sentence, habeas relief is not available.  The jury did not rely solely on the invalid factor in making its decision.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a concurrence, stating that the sentence could stand on a line of cases where convictions are upheld if any of the counts are sustainable.  Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a concurrence emphasizing the application of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in capitol sentencing cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent condemning capital punishment as cruel and unusual.  He also felt the aggravating circumstance used in making the sentencing decision was constitutionally defective.  Justice William J. Brennan joined in the dissent. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21430,"name":"Daryl A.

With the state\u0027s total population and its sixty-four House seats, the ideal apportionment would have been 7,337 persons per representative. Given the guarantee of county representation, Niobrara County, with a population of less than half the ideal (2,924), was allocated a House seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the State of Wyoming violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by allocating one of its state House seats to a county with a population considerably lower than the average population per state representative?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court upheld the Wyoming apportionment scheme and found no Fourteenth Amendment violations. Justice Powell argued that using counties as legislative districts and assuring at least one representative per county supported \"substantial and legitimate state concerns.\" Since the population variations in the Wyoming plan were the result of the consistent application of a nondiscriminatory and legitimate state policy, the plan was consistent with the Constitution. Any dilution of voting strength which the constituents of the other sixty-three representatives may have experienced as a result of Niobrara\u0027s relatively small population was minimal and irrelevant given the advantages of the Wyoming scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38974,"name":"Randall T.

The contracts contained \"price escalator\" clauses which provided for gas prices to rise to the levels set by governmental authorities. In 1978, the federal government established a new system for regulating natural gas prices under the Natural Gas Policy Act. The Act set maximum lawful prices that could be charged for different types of natural gas and applied these price levels to intrastate gas markets. The Act allowed states to set maximum price levels below federal levels, which Kansas did under the Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act (Kansas Act). When ERG tried to raise its prices to the higher federal levels using the \"price escalator\" clause, KPL insisted that it was only legally obligated to buy gas at the lower prices set by the Kansas Act. ERG claimed that KPL violated the contract by refusing to pay federal prices. In response, KPL argued that the Kansas Act clearly prohibited the use of federal price levels to trigger \"price escalator\" clauses. After a state trial court ruled in favor of KPL, ERG claimed that the Kansas Act violated the Contract Clause by preventing federal price changes from affecting state contracts. The Supreme Court of Kansas held that the Kansas Act did not violate the Contract Clause since it was a legitimate effort by the state of Kansas to protect its economy from rapid price changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act violate the Contract Clause by preventing federal price controls on natural gas from affecting price adjustments made under intrastate contracts?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry Blackmun delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. The Court determined that ERG did not have its contractual rights \"substantially impaired\" and found that the state of Kansas had \"significant and legitimate public purpose[s]\" for passing the Kansas Act. The contract between ERG and KPL facilitated changes in prices according to governmental price controls, and the new state price controls adhered to federal guidelines. In passing the Kansas Act, the state \"exercised its police powers to protect consumers from the escalation of natural gas prices.\" The Natural Gas Policy Act set maximum price levels for natural gas but explicitly permitted states to lower these levels. Therefore \"price escalator\" clauses included in intrastate contracts would adhere to lawfully enacted state price levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25219,"name":"Gary W.

Marshall Space Flight Center (Center), a facility operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), made a series of public comments critical of the Center. Lucas, the Center \u003cem\u003es director, demoted Bush on the ground that the comments were false and misleading. The Federal Employee Appeals Authority upheld the demotion, but the Civil Service Commission\u003c/em\u003e s (CSC) Appeals Review Board later found that the demotion had violated his First Amendment rights. NASA accepted the Board_s recommendation that Bush be restored to his former position retroactively, with back pay. While his administrated appeal was pending, Bush brought suit against Lucas in Alabama state court, seeking to recover damages for violation of his First Amendment rights. Lucas removed the action to federal district court, which granted summary judgment for Lucas. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Bush had no cause of action for damages under the First Amendment in view of the available remedies under the CSC regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a federal employee sue for damages for the violation of his First Amendment rights by his superior where Congress has provided a comprehensive remedial scheme, although one which does not fully compensate the employee for the harm suffered?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo; not under the CSC regulations. The federal judiciary, pursuant to its common law authority, has the power to recognize new causes of action in absence of, or to supplement, statutory remedies unless Congress has expressly indicated its relief is to be exclusive. In determining whether judicial relief should be granted, federal courts are (1) to pay particular attention to special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress, and (2) to ascertain whether the purpose and comprehensive nature of the statutory scheme precludes judicial remedies where statutory relief is available. The administrative scheme in this case reflected Congress_ attempt to balance the competing interests of protecting the First Amendment rights of federal employees and maintaining a disciplined and effective workforce. Congress, not the judiciary, is in the best position to regulate the employee relations. Grant of supplementary judicial relief would disrupt this balance and is therefore inappropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44605,"name":"William Harvey Elrod, Jr.","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_harvey_elrod","view_count":0,"last_name":"Elrod,","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"william_harvey_elrod"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12823"},{"advocate":{"ID":33830,"name":"Kenneth Steven Geller","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/kenneth_s_geller","view_count":0,"last_name":"Geller","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"kenneth_s_geller"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12824"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":18105,"title":"Oral Argument - January 19, 1983","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/18105"}],"citation":{"volume":"462","page":"367","year":"1983","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/16673"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.
