Junius Scales was criminally charged with membership in the Communist Party of the United States (\"Party\") because it advocated the overthrow of the government \"as speedily as circumstances would permit.\" Challenging his felony charge, Scales claimed that the Internal Security Act of 1950 (\"Security Act\") stated that membership in a Communist organization shall not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. After failing in both a district and appellate court, the Supreme Court granted review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a Communist Party member\u0027s conviction under the Smith Act, which makes a felony the knowing membership in organizations advocating the violent or forceful overthrow of the United States government, violate the Fifth Amendment\u0027s due process clause in light of the apparent protections afforded to such members under the Internal Security Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that the Security Act protects \"per se\" members of an organization from criminal prosecution. The Smith Act, by contrast, goes beyond \"per se\" participation by targeting those whose membership in an organization entails their knowing and deliberate participation in criminal activity. In light of this distinction, the Court noted, the two Acts are not conflicted. Since Scales, at the very least, knew, encouraged, and provoked illegal Party activities over the course of his eight year membership, he was guilty under the Smith Act of complicity in the commission of criminal activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43387,"name":"Telford Taylor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/telford_taylor","view_count":0,"last_name":"Taylor","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"telford_taylor"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21014"},{"advocate":{"ID":35692,"name":"Mr John F.

Crown Kosher Super Market had previously been open for business on Sundays, on which it conducted about one- third of its weekly business. In 1962, the Massachusetts’ Legislature enacted a statute forbidding shops to be open and doing any labor, business, or work on Sunday. The Crown Kosher Super Market argued this provision violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since it does not respect their religious practices. The federal district court held that this provision is unconstitutional, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and held that the provision does not prohibit the free exercise of religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo statutes that require stores to close on Sundays violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by not respecting the establishment of religion and prohibiting free exercise as applied to the states?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The court held that statutes requiring stores to stay closed on Sundays do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, the statute in question does not prohibit the free exercise of religion. A statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause simply because in practice it results in some inequality. The Court also concluded the statute was not for religious purposes, as the defendants contested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered a dissenting opinion arguing the Sunday closing statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because one religion is economically disadvantaged by it. In his separate dissent, Justice Potter Stewart agreed with Justice Brennan’s dissent and added that making a citizen chose between his faith and economic survival is a cruel choice as well as unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26936,"name":"Herbert B.

He pledged his insurance policies to Huntington National Bank of Columbus, Ohio as collateral security for a loan. This gave the bank the right to satisfy its claim out of the \u0027net proceeds of the policy when it becomes a claim by death.\u0027 After Peter Meyer pledged the policies to the bank, the United States determined that he owed $6,159.09 plus interest in unpaid taxes. The United States filed notice of tax lien on July 11, 1955.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Meyer died on December 28, 1955, owing $26,844.66 to Huntington National Bank. Ethel Meyer, the petitioner and Peter Meyer\u0027s widow, was named executrix of his estate and received $441.21, representing the remainder of the full cash surrender from Peter Meyer\u0027s insurance policies after payment to the bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States brought suit against Ethel Meyer under 26 U.S.C.A. 6321 and 6322, arguing that it should be compensated for the full tax lien by marshalling the funds already paid to Huntington National Bank. At trial, Ethel Meyer argued that she owed nothing to the government because she was not personally liable for Peter Meyer\u0027s tax lien. She also argued that the tax lien did not and could not attach to the net proceeds of the cash surrender because those proceeds would be exempt under New York Insurance Law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistrict court Judge Edmund Palmieri held that the government was entitled to recover the full tax lien through the insurance policy\u0027s full cash surrender. The court relied on \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Behrens\u003c/em\u003e, where the court ordered a defendant to pay both a bank lien and tax lien from the same cash surrender. Although most of Peter Meyer\u0027s cash surrender was pledged to the bank for the payment of loans, this did not preclude the government from collecting on its full tax lien first. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, affirmed in a \u003cem\u003eper curiam\u003c/em\u003e ruling. The court agreed that Behrens controlled the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a federal tax lien attach to the net proceeds of life insurance policies paid to Peter Meyer\u0027s widow?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Thomas Whittaker, writing for the majority in a 6-3 decision, held that New York state law controlled the case; New York exempted the net proceeds of insurance policy cash surrenders from attaching to tax liens. There was not clear guidance in federal law on this matter, whereas New York law protected the cash surrender in question. As the priority of liens is then determined by \"first in time first in right,\" the United States did not have a right to marshal the cash surrender to recover its tax lien because the bank\u0027s debt had priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White, joined by Justices John Harlan and Potter Stewart, dissented. He argued that federal law should control the case to avoid inconsistent results in different states; once a tax lien has attached to a taxpayer\u0027s interests, federal law then determines the priority of liens. He also disputed the majority\u0027s interpretation of New York law, and did not find a clear, consistent policy of protecting the net proceeds of insurance policies\u0027 cash surrenders from creditors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14365,"title":"Oral Argument - October 12, 1960","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14365"}],"citation":{"volume":"364","page":"410","year":"1960","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24835"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Burton, an African American, entered the Eagle Coffee Shoppe, a restaurant leasing space within a parking garage operated by the Wilmington Parking Authority, and was denied service solely because of his race. The Parking Authority is a tax-exempt, private corporation created by legislative action of the City of Wilmington for the purpose of operating the city\u0027s parking facilities, and its construction projects are partially funded by contributions from the city. The Parking Authority provided the restaurant heating and gas services and maintained the premises at its own expense. Burton filed suit seeking an injunction preventing the restaurant from operating in a racially discriminatory manner on the ground that doing so violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A state court granted the injunction but was reversed on appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Eagle Coffee Shoppe\u0027s refusal to serve Burton constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Tom C. Clark, the Court concluded that the restaurant, as a recipient of assistance by the parking authority, benefited from the city\u0027s aid and constituted an financially integral and indispensable part of the state. As such, the Court found that the restaurant and the parking authority were so physically and financially intertwined that the private entity\u0027s conduct could be imputed to the government. Thus, it’s discrimination could be considered state action in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart concurred in the judgment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan, joined by Justice Whittaker, dissented.

None of those parts were individually patented.  Convertible Top sued Aro Manufacturing Co., Inc. for direct and contributory patent infringement for manufacturing and selling replacement fabric designed to fit the patented device.  After trial, the district court ruled in favor of Convertible Top and enjoined Aro from further manufacture or distribution of the fabric replacements.  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a patent holder prevent the manufacture and/or distribution of a replacement part for a patented device when the replacement part is not itself patented?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Charles E. Whittaker, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed.  The Supreme Court held that because Convertible Top did not patent the fabric top individually, there was no direct patent infringement.  With no direct infringement, there could be no contributory infringement.  The patent only covered the combination of parts that made up the folding top, not each individual part that made up that top.  Justice Hugo L. Black concurred, writing that the other concurring opinion and the dissenting opinion were unnecessarily confusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan concurred in the result, arguing that there was no infringement because the cost of the replacement top in comparison with the device as a whole was so small made replacing the top a permissible repair instead of a reconstruction.  Justice John M. Harlan dissented, arguing that the replacement of an unpatented part in a patented device is a forbidden reconstruction of the device.  This constitutes direct patent infringement.  Justice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21673,"name":"David Wolf","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/david_wolf","view_count":0,"last_name":"Wolf","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"david_wolf"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21821"},{"advocate":{"ID":22964,"name":"Elliott I.

He became a U.S. citizen in 1940, one year after filing a petition for naturalization with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”). In 1953, the Government filed a complaint, which alleged that Chaunt had concealed and misrepresented his arrest record in his application for citizenship, and sought to revoke his naturalization. The district court held that Chaunt had concealed his membership in the Communist Party and three arrests in Connecticut for distributing handbills, violating park regulations, and committing a breach of the peace. All of the arrests occurred more than ten years prior to Chaunt’s naturalization. The district court cancelled the order granting citizenship to Chaunt, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Government meet its standard of proof required under the Immigration and Nationality Act to revoke an order of naturalization?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the Government failed to show by “clear, unequivocal and convincing” evidence that Chaunt either concealed facts warranting a denial of citizenship or that their disclosure would have led to the discovery of other facts warranting a denial of citizenship. The arrests did not justify revocation of Chaunt’s citizenship because each arrest occurred outside the statutory requirement of demonstrated good moral character for five years prior to a petition for naturalization, and the charges did not involve moral turpitude. Noting Chaunt’s disclosure of his employment with the International Workers’ Order, an organization purportedly controlled by Communists, the Court declined to find that disclosure of the arrests might have led the INS to discover that Chaunt once served as a district organizer of the Communist Party in Connecticut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Immigration and Nationality Act only requires that the Government prove that Chaunt’s conduct blocked an investigation that might have resulted in the rejection of his application. He argued that the Government satisfied this test by showing that Chaunt intentionally concealed his arrest record because the INS could have rejected his application if it had discovered this misconduct prior to the court’s naturalization order. Justice Charles E. Whittaker and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30227,"name":"Joseph Forer","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/joseph_forer","view_count":0,"last_name":"Forer","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"joseph_forer"},"advocate_description":"for the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21548"},{"advocate":{"ID":36546,"name":"Maurice A.

In return, the company gave Knetsch loans and an annuity contract that would produce monthly annuity payments upon maturity. However, Knetsch kept borrowing from the insurance company in amounts that kept the net cash value of the annuity so low that it could produce no financial benefit other than tax deductions. Knetsch claimed payments to the insurance company as interest paid on indebtedness. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions and determined a deficiency amount for each of the two years in question. After paying the deficiency, Knetsch brought suit to obtain a refund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The court ruled in favor of United States, holding that the transaction was a sham because it did not create \"indebtedness\" and, therefore, there was \"no commercial economic substance\" beyond the tax deductions. The U.S. Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the transaction between Knetsch and the insurance company create an indebtedness within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote for the majority affirming the lower court\u0027s decision that the transaction was a sham. The loans the insurance company gave Knetsch were essentially rebates for a substantial portion of the interest payments and the small amount kept by the company was its fee for providing a \"façade of loans\" to be used to provide tax deductions. Justice William O. Douglas dissented, saying that as long as a transaction is allowed within the limits of insurance policies it should be recognized by the Internal Revenue Service, and any remedy should be left to the legislature.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14470,"title":"Oral Argument - October 18, 1960","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14470"},{"id":14671,"title":"Oral Argument - October 17, 1960","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14671"}],"citation":{"volume":"364","page":"361","year":"1960","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24863"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The subcommittee was investigating Communist propaganda in the southern United States.  Wilkinson refused to answer any questions, including whether he was a member of the Communist Party.  He did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and argued instead that the subcommittee had no authority to interrogate him.  Wilkinson also argued that he was only called before the subcommittee because of his public opposition to the Un-American Activities Committee.  Wilkinson was incited and convicted for contempt of Congress.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Were the questions asked of Wilkinson pertinent to the subjects under inquiry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the subcommittee have the authority to question Wilkinson?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, Yes.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a 5-4 majority affirmed.  The Supreme Court held that the subcommittee’s investigation was clearly authorized by Congress.  The question of whether Wilkin was a member of the Communist Party was relevant to the inquiry so Wilkinson was obligated to answer.  The reasons why Wilkinson was called before the committee were irrelevant to the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black dissented, arguing that an investigation of those who criticize the Un-American Activities Committee is unconstitutional.  Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William O. Douglas joined in the dissent.  Justice Douglas dissented separately, arguing that Congress did not authorize the type of investigation that took place.  Chief Justice Warren and Justice Black joined in the dissent.  Justice William J. Brennan dissented, arguing that the primary purpose of questioning Wilkinson was to expose him for the sake of exposure, rather than to aid lawmaking.  Justice Douglas joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40696,"name":"Rowland Watts","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/rowland_watts","view_count":0,"last_name":"Watts","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"rowland_watts"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21840"},{"advocate":{"ID":33912,"name":"Kevin T.

Torcaso was appointed to the office of Notary Public by the Governor of Maryland, but he could not receive his commission to serve because he would not declare his belief in God as the Maryland Constitution required. He sued for his commission in the Maryland Circuit Court on the grounds that the requirement violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The circuit court rejected his claims and the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state requirement that a candidate for public office profess a belief in God in order to be eligible violate the First Amendment protection of the freedom of religion?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Hugo L. Black delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that such a requirement places the state of Maryland firmly on the side of those people who believe in God and are willing to state their belief. With this requirement, Maryland effectively aids religions that profess a belief in God at the expense of any other form of belief or disbelief. The First Amendment expressly prohibits a state from taking this position.

The officers broke down the door, forced Monroe and his wife to stand naked in their living room, and ransacked the apartment. Afterwards, James Monroe was escorted to police quarters and held for ten hours on \"open\" charges while he was interrogated about a murder. The police did not have a warrant for the search or the arrest, and refused Monroe permission to call his attorney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonroe brought a complaint against each of the Chicago police officers individually and against the City of Chicago. The City of Chicago moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was not liable under the Civil Rights Act nor for acts committed in performance of governmental functions. All defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that there was no cause of action under the Civil Rights Acts. The district court dismissed the complaint. The United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit affirmed the district court\u0027s dismissal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Does a person have a valid cause of action under the Civil Rights Act against police officers when the police officers violate that person\u0027s due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Can municipalities be liable under the Civil Rights Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and No. Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority, stated that the city police officers, in conducting an unreasonable search and seizure, had committed an action which was under the color of law, and that the police could be held liable individually under the Civil Rights Act. However, the majority further held that a municipality could not be liable under the Civil Rights Act. So, the court reversed the lower court\u0027s opinion insofar as it dismissed the Civil Rights Act claim against the police officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Marshall Harlan II wrote a concurring opinion which Justice Potter Stewart joined. In his opinion, Justice Harlan discussed the difficulties in explaining the distinction between authorized or unauthorized deprivations of constitutional rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter wrote a dissent arguing that a police officer who acts outside the law loses his authority under the law, making a state tort claim against individual officers more appropriate than a claim under the Civil Rights Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14193,"title":"Oral Argument - November 08, 1960 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14193"},{"id":14712,"title":"Oral Argument - November 08, 1960 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14712"}],"citation":{"volume":"365","page":"167","year":"1961","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24905"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The Virginia Electric Company owned 1,540 acres of the property in question that had been purchased from the estate owner in 1907 and would be part of the government’s easement. In 1951, the government reached an agreement with the estate owner to purchase the easement for one dollar and to officially acquire the land through a condemnation proceeding. The Virginia Electric Company, whose land was about to be taken in the easement, intervened to contest the issue of just compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court awarded a substantial compensation to the Virginia Electric Company, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the decision in United States v. Twin City Power Company that held that the amount of compensation should not take into account the value of the land for water power purposes. On remand, the district court appointed commissioners to evaluate the value of the land and awarded $65,520 in compensation. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes land used for easement have compensable value when appropriated by the government?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that the land the government was taking for easement had market value, and the Fifth Amendment prevents the government from taking private property without compensation. The Court also held that the district court’s method of determining the value of the land was correct, but the determination of how much of that compensation is due to the Virginia Electric Company was not correct. The district court granted compensation based on the maximum possible value rather than the actual value based on land use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the owner of the easement did not have rights to anything that gained value from the flow of the stream. However, the owner did have the rights to anything that was considered “property” under the Fifth Amendment and deserved to be justly compensated when the government takes that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Charles E. Whittaker wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that compensation should be based on the value the land the owner had at the time the government took it. Because the Virginia Electric Company only owned that land in the hope that it would gain permission from the government to build a dam, the land had no value to the company when it was taken. He argued that the Fifth Amendment required compensation only based on what value the owner had lost rather than what the government has gained. Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62688,"name":"Perry Morton","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/perry_morton","view_count":0,"last_name":"Morton","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"perry_morton"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21660"},{"advocate":{"ID":62689,"name":"Ralph H.

As an Orthodox Jew, he was prohibited by his faith from working on Saturday, the Sabbath. The Pennsylvania blue law only allowed certain stores to remain open for business on Sundays. Braunfeld\u0027s store was not one of those types allowed to be open. He challenged the law as a violation of the religious liberty clauses because he needed to be open six days a week for economic reasons and was prohibited from doing so by a tenet of his faith and the blue law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Pennsylvania blue law violate the First Amendment\u0027s protection of free exercise of religious beliefs?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that the Pennsylvania blue law did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The freedom to hold religious beliefs and opinions is absolute; however, the freedom to act (even in accordance with religious convictions) is not totally free from government restrictions. The Court found that the Sunday Closing Law had a secular basis and did not make any religious practices unlawful. The blue law is valid despite its indirect burden on religious observance unless the state can accomplish its secular goal of providing a uniform day of rest for all through other means.

Boynton entered the segregated restaurant in the bus station and sat on the side reserved for white customers. Both a waitress and a manager requested that Boynton move to the other side of the restaurant, and he explained that he was an interstate bus passenger and refused. A police officer arrived and arrested Boynton. He was tried, convicted, and fined for unlawfully remaining on the premises after being forbidden to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoynton appealed his conviction to the Hustings Court in Richmond where he filed a motion to dismiss and argued that his constitutional rights were violated. The Hustings Court denied the motion. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Boyton’s conviction violate the Interstate Commerce Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 should be interpreted to ban all forms of segregation by race in any type of public transportation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting for the 7-2 majority, Justice Hugo L. Black concluded that, because the bus carrier provides the services of the terminal and its restaurant to the interstate passengers, these services must be subject to the same discrimination prohibitions as the transportation itself. Since the Interstate Commerce Act prohibits racial discrimination during travel, the same restrictions apply in the stations during stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Charles E. Whittaker, joined by Justice Tom C. Clark, wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the restaurant was owned and operated by a private owner unaffiliated with the bus company. Without evidence that the bus company had control over the operation of the restaurant, there was no reason to hold the restaurant to the discrimination prohibitions laid out by the Interstate Commerce Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

The Court also found that the blue laws did not violate the division between church and state. Sunday closing laws started out to facilitate church attendance in colonial America; however, the present Maryland laws are based on secular rather than religious state interests. The laws are to improve the \"health, safety, recreation, and general well-being\" of citizens. The present purpose of the laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all.
