Three of Jaffree\u0027s children attended public schools in Mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Alabama law violate the First Amendment\u0027s Establishment Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court determined the constitutionality of Alabama\u0027s prayer and meditation statute by applying the secular purpose test, which asked if the state\u0027s actual purpose was to endorse or disapprove of religion. The Court held that Alabama\u0027s passage of the prayer and meditation statute was not only a deviation from the state\u0027s duty to maintain absolute neutrality toward religion, but was an affirmative endorsement of religion. As such, the statute clearly lacked any secular purpose as it sought to establish religion in public schools, thereby violating the First Amendment\u0027s Establishment Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37751,"name":"Paul M.

The indictment alleged he conspired with a burglar and overstated the value of the stolen items so his insurer would pay him more in damages recovery. The prosecution presented evidence proving that Miller had overstated the value of the items but did not try to establish that he had conspired with the burglar. The jury found his overstatement of value sufficient to convict him of fraud. Miller argued that by convicting him despite the fact that the prosecutors only addressed part of the indictment, the jury violated his Fifth Amendment right to be tried only on a grand jury indictment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and reversed his conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fifth Amendment right to be tried on a grand jury indictment provide that the jury can only convict the accused if the prosecution addresses every allegation included in the indictment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the decision for an 8-0 court. The Court maintained that an indictment is valid so long as it \"clearly set[s] out the offense for which [the accused] was ultimately convicted.\" In this case, the defense clearly understood that Miller could be convicted for fraud solely because he overstated the value of the stolen items. Failing to convict him on other grounds did not annul his proven criminal conduct. The allegation of conspiring with a burglar constituted another \"means of committing the same crime\" and could be \"treated as a useless averment that may be ignored\" once the prosecution dropped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15933,"name":"Mr. Andrew L.

Having previously received a tip that Carney was using the motor home to sell marijuana in exchange for sexual favors, the officers kept the motor home under surveillance while the two were inside. When the youth exited, the officers contacted him, and he confirmed that Carney gave him marijuana in exchange for receiving Carney’s sexual advances. The officers knocked on the door of the mobile home, identified themselves, and entered without a warrant or consent. They found marijuana, plastic bags, and a scale on the table. The officers arrested Carney for possession of marijuana with intent to sell.\n\u003cp\u003eCarney moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the warrantless search of the motor home, and the trial court denied the motion. Carney pleaded no contest, was convicted, and placed on probation. He appealed, and the California Court of Appeals upheld the conviction on the grounds that the motor home fell under the vehicle exception to the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court of California reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the warrantless search of a motor home violate the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied a lesser degree of protection to motor vehicles based on the ability to easily and quickly move them before a warrant can be obtained. Also, the regulation surrounding automobiles affords them a lesser expectation of privacy and therefore less protection under the Fourth Amendment. Since Carney’s motor home was not in an area traditionally used for residence and was licensed to operate as a vehicle on public streets, the Court held that it should receive the level of constitutional protection of a motor vehicle rather than a residence. The Court also held that the officers had probable cause and that the search itself was reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent where he argued that the Court should have relied on the ruling of the California Supreme Court to establish precedent for that state. He also argued that the majority’s decision overemphasized the exceptions to the Fourth Amendment. Since the motor home was neither in motion nor was there any indication that Carney would quickly move it, there were no circumstances to prevent the officers from obtaining a warrant. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42801,"name":"Thomas F.

Garcia also alleged that Martin Vigil, the Chief of the State Police, knew Wilson had attacked citizens on several occasions but had failed to take action. Garcia sued for a violation of Section 1983 of the United State Code, a civil rights statute that creates a civil cause of action for the deprivation of rights. The petitioners argued that this Section 1983 claim should be subject to the two-year statute of limitations that applied to a similar cause of action found in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (Act). If that statute of limitations were applied, this case could not proceed because the complaint was not filed until two years and nine months after the alleged beating. The district court held that the two-year statute of limitations recommended by petitioners did not apply because it was not sufficiently related to the nature of the right being enforced by Garcia\u0027s claim. Instead, the district court held that a different cause of action in the Act was more closely related to this Section 1983 claim and applied that cause of action\u0027s four-year statute of limitations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court\u0027s ruling but held that actions brought under Section 1983 are essentially an injury to personal rights; therefore, the three-year statute of limitations that applies to all personal injury actions in New Mexico should apply to Section 1983 claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Are claims under Section 1983 of the United States Code federal claims?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Should a uniform statute of limitations apply to all the causes of action that give rise to Section 1983 violations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(3) Are state-level personal injury claims sufficiently similar to violations of civil rights claimed under Section 1983 such that they should have the same statute of limitations?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, yes. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion for the 7-1 majority. The Court held that, in situations where a federal action does not have a statute of limitations, the practice has been to adopt a local limitation as long as that limitation is not inconsistent with a federal law or policy. Looking at the language of Section 1983, the Court determined that Congress intended to create a federal cause of action; therefore, it is up to the federal courts to determine the proper statute of limitation. The Court also determined that the importance of consistency and the diversity of Section 1983 causes of action required a uniform limitation for all causes of action to prevent uncertainty and quarrels over which limitation to apply. Finally, the Court agreed with the appellate court that the three-year personal injury limitation was the best available because of the nature of the remedy afforded by Section 1983.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor wrote a dissenting opinion in which she argued that there need not be a uniform application of limitations to all Section 1983 claims. Rather, each claim should be evaluated individually and assigned a limitation that is most analogous to the specific claim that is brought before the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F.

When the FDA denied enforcement, the inmates brought suit claiming violations of the FDCA and requesting that the FDA be required to take enforcement actions. The district court granted summary judgment to the FDA holding that decisions declining to initiate enforcement proceedings were not judicially reviewable. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, finding that the decision not to begin an enforcement action was judicially reviewable under 5 U.S.C. Section 701(a)(2) and an abuse of discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre decisions made by the FDA not to exercise enforcement authority over the use of drugs precluded from judicial review by Section 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 501 et seq. (APA)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, they are presumptively unreviewable. Refusals of administrative agencies to exercise enforcement authority involve a complicated balancing of factors, including agency allocation of scarce resources, which are not suitable for judicial review. Thus, they are presumptively \"committed to agency discretion by law\" under Section 701(a)(2). This presumption may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers. In the instant case, the presumption of unreviewability was not overcome by the enforcement provisions of the FDCA. The FDCA\u0027s prohibition on \"misbranding\" of drugs and introduction of \"new drugs,\" absent agency approval, does not supply relevant guidelines. Neither does the FDA\u0027s \"policy statement\" indicating that the agency considered itself \"obligated\" to take certain investigative actions nor the FDCA\u0027s provision that the Secretary need not report for prosecution minor violations of the Act supply relevant guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41618,"name":"Stephen M.

The government’s two principal witnesses were James F. O’Connor and Donald E. Mitchell, private security guards. Between April and June 1977, they assisted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (“ATF”) in conducting an undercover investigation of Bagley. In response to a discovery request for information about any deals, promises or inducements made to O’Connor or Mitchell, the government produced only affidavits from each man stating that each spoke without any threats or rewards, or promises of reward. Bagley waived his right to a jury trial. At trial, O’Connor and Mitchell testified about the firearms and narcotics charges. On December 23, 1977, the court found Bagley guilty on the narcotics charges, but not the firearms charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn mid-1980, Bagley filed requests pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and to the Privacy Act of 1974. He received copies of ATF form contracts, each entitled, “Contract for Purchase of Information and Payment of Lump Sum Therefor.” These contracts indicated that O’Connor and Mitchell provided information to the ATF and promised a future payment of $300 to each informer. Bagley moved to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, alleging that the government’s failure to disclose the contracts violated his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motion came before the same district judge who presided at Bagley’s trial. At an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate found that neither informant expected payment for his testimony. In contrast, the district judge found that O’Connor and Mitchell probably expected to receive compensation for their assistance, and that the government suppressed evidence favorable to Bagley. He also concluded, however, that the disclosure would not have had an effect on the court’s verdict. He emphasized that Bagley’s counsel did not seek to discredit O’Connor or Mitchell on cross-examination. The United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, reversed, reasoning that the government’s failure to disclose required automatic reversal because it impaired Bagley’s Sixth Amendment right to confront adverse witnesses through effective cross-examination.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust Bagley’s convictions for narcotics violations be set aside as a violation of due process because the government failed to disclose that two witnesses were impeachable, although the district judge determined that this failure did not affect the outcome of the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-3 decision written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the Court held that the government’s failure to disclose the contacts in discovery did not violate the Due Process Clause. Justice Blackmun wrote that the state was required by due process to disclose evidence that was both favorable to the accused and material to either guilt or punishment, and that impeachment evidence fell within this requirement. He rejected, however, the Ninth Circuit’s argument that the government’s failure to disclose impeachment evidence required automatic reversal. The Court was concerned with undisclosed impeachment evidence that directly restricted the scope of cross-examination; here, Bagley’s counsel was free to cross-examine the informants on any relevant subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelying on \u003ci\u003eUnited States v. Agurs\u003c/i\u003e, Justice Blackmun held that undisclosed evidence was material if there was a reasonable possibility that the result of the proceeding would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed. He acknowledged that the government’s failure likely lead the defense counsel to believe that the informants could not be impeached on the basis of bias or inducements offered by the government. Nonetheless, the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the outcome would have been the same if the government had disclosed the evidence in question. Justice Blackmun reversed the Ninth Circuit’s decision and remanded the case for reconsideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White concurred in part and concurred in the judgment, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist. He would have simply held that the proper standard was one of reasonable probability and that the Ninth Circuit failed to apply the standard necessities reversal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented, joined by Justice William Brennan. He argued that a failure to disclose cannot be considered harmless when the government withholds evidence that might impeach the prosecution’s only witnesses. He wrote that the majority’s standard encouraged prosecutors to withhold potentially dispositive evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented.

Instead, he wrote letters to various government officials stating that he had not registered and did not intend to do so. Wayte\u0027s letters were added to a file kept by the Selective Service of men who had informed the government that they were not complying with the proclamation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Selective Service later adopted a policy of passive enforcement, in which it would prosecute only men who had either reported to the government that they were not registering or whom other people had reported to the government for not registering. After a long series of requests by the government that Wayte register (all of which he failed to respond to), the government eventually indicted Wayte in federal district court for violating the Military Selective Service Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court, however, dismissed the indictment, holding that the government\u0027s passive enforcement policy was unconstitutional because it amounted to selective prosecution of only those men who took an outspoken stance against the Selective Service. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Wayte had failed to show that the government focused its attention on him because of his protest activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Justice Department\u0027s policy of passive enforcement of the Selective Service Act, in which it prosecuted only those men who were reported by others or who reported themselves for not registering with the Selective Service system, violate the First and Fifth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court held, 7-to-2, that the government\u0027s passive enforcement policy was constitutional. In the majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell found that the government\u0027s policy was not unconstitutional selective enforcement (in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection clause) because men who had not taken an outspoken stance against the Selective Service, but who were merely reported by others for failing to register, were treated the same as those men who had notified the government of their own refusal to register. Justice Powell wrote, \"In the present case, petitioner has not shown that the Government prosecuted him because of his protest activities. Absent such a showing, his claim of selective prosecution fails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo decide the First Amendment challenge, Justice Powell cited four requirements for incidental government regulation of speech laid out in United States v. O\u0027Brien: the regulation must be within the government\u0027s constitutional power, must further an important or substantial government interest, must have an interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech, and must restrict only as much speech as is necessary to meet the government interest. Powell found that the passive enforcement policy satisfied all these requirements, and therefore did not violate the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36552,"name":"Mark D.

Thornton worked as a supervisor in the Caldor department store chain. A devout Presbyterian, Thornton asked to be excused from working Sundays at the company\u0027s store in Torrington, Connecticut. The store required its managers to work one of every four Sundays, although rank-and-file employees were exempt under their union contract from Sunday work. In 1979, the company refused to allow Thornton to take off Sundays but offered him a transfer to another store, an hour away in Massachusetts, that was closed on Sundays. When he turned that down, the company said it would demote him from his manager\u0027s job and cut his hourly pay from $6.46 to $3.50. Thornton had worked Sundays for nearly eight months before he became aware the store was violating Connecticut law giving employees an absolute right not to work on their chosen Sabbath. He filed a grievance against Caldor with the state board of mediation. The board ruled in his favor. The state supreme court reversed. Thornton\u0027s estate (Thornton died in 1982) petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Connecticut statute violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the Court held 8-to-1 that the Connecticut Sabbath observance statute was void, saying its \"unyielding weighing in favor of Sabbath observers over all other interests\" results in an unconstitutional mingling of church and state. In his opinion, Burger wrote that the Connecticut law \"provides Sabbath observers with an absolute and unqualified right not to work on their Sabbath.\" Burger said the state law \"thus commands that Sabbath religious concerns automatically control over all secular interests at the workplace; the statute takes no account of the convenience or interests of the employer or those of other employees who do not observe a Sabbath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37922,"name":"Paul Gerwitz","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/paul_gerwitz","view_count":0,"last_name":"Gerwitz","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"paul_gerwitz"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13353"},{"advocate":{"ID":37177,"name":"Nathan Lewin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/nathan_lewin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Lewin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"nathan_lewin"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13354"},{"advocate":{"ID":31633,"name":"Joseph I.

Smith alleged that, while he was being considered for the position of U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, McDonald sent two letters to President Ronald Reagan that contained libelous falsehoods about him. Smith claimed that McDonald knew the accusations in the letters were false and that he mailed the letters with malicious intent to undermine the prospect of Smith’s appointment as U.S. Attorney. Smith’s complaint alleged that the letters had their intended effect—he was not appointed to the position, and he suffered damage to his career and reputation—so he sought compensatory damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcDonald removed the case to the district court on the basis of diverse citizenship and moved for judgment on the pleadings by arguing that the Petition Clause granted him absolute immunity. The district court held that the Petition Clause granted general immunity but not absolute immunity from liability for libel. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Petition Clause of the First Amendment grant absolute immunity to a defendant charged with sending libelous letters to the President of the United States?\u003cbr /\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion of the 8-0 majority. The Supreme Court held that, while the Petition Clause was an important foundation for the ideas of self-government, there is no evidence that the Framers intended it to allow the unchecked expression of false information. Previous cases have also shown that the right to petition is not without limits; baseless litigation is not protected under the Petition Clause. The Court also held that damages may not be recovered without proof that the defendant acted with actual malice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote that the Framers intended the Petition Clause to be a part of the overlapping First Amendment protections of free expression. Since the other parts of the First Amendment do not grant absolute immunity, he argued that there was no reason to assume that the Petition Clause should. Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F.

Even though the Court acknowledged that the efforts of the City of New York were well-intentioned, it found that the funding practices violated the Constitution. As part of New York\u0027s program, teachers were directed to avoid involvement in religious materials and activities in their classrooms. This, as well as the actions of school administrators and field supervisors who monitored classroom activities for religious content, posed constitutional problems for the majority. Involving agents of the city in extensive monitoring increased the potential for \"divisiveness along religious lines\" and violated the intent of the Establishment Clause which is to prevent the intrusion of church and state on each other\u0027s respective domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41388,"name":"Stanley Geller","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/stanley_geller","view_count":0,"last_name":"Geller","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"stanley_geller"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13440"},{"advocate":{"ID":39761,"name":"Rex E.

Harper \u0026amp; Row negotiated a prepublication agreement with Time Magazine for the right to excerpt 7,500 words from Ford\u0027s account of his pardon of former President Richard Nixon. Before Time released its article, an unauthorized source provided The Nation Magazine with the unpublished Ford manuscript. Subsequently, The Nation, using approximately 300 words from the manuscript, scooped Time. Harper \u0026amp; Row sued The Nation, alleging violations of the Copyright Revision Act of 1976. The District Court held that The Nation\u0027s use of the copyrighted material constituted infringement. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that Nation\u0027s use of the copyrighted material was sanctioned as a fair use.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Copyright Revision Act of 1976\u0027s fair use doctrine sanction The Nation\u0027s unauthorized use of quotations from former President Gerald Ford\u0027s unpublished manuscript?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that The Nation\u0027s use of verbatim excerpts from the unpublished manuscript was not a fair use. The Court reasoned that the unpublished nature of a work is a key, though not necessarily determinative, factor tending to negate a defense of fair use. \"Under ordinary circumstances, the author\u0027s right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use,\" wrote Justice O\u0027Connor. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the four statutory factors relevant to determining whether the use was fair were not satisfied. In his dissent, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., argued that the Court was advancing the protection of the copyright owner\u0027s economic interest \"through an exceedingly narrow definition of the scope of fair use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22806,"name":"Edward A.

Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., a Puerto Rico corporation, entered into distribution and sales agreements with Mitsubishi Motors, a Japanese corporation that manufactures automobiles in Japan.  The sales agreement provided for arbitration by the Japanese Commercial Arbitration Association of all disputes arising out of certain articles of the agreement.  A dispute did arise from slowing automobile sales.  When the dispute could not be resolved, Mitsubishi sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking an order to compel arbitration.  Soler filed counterclaims, including Sherman Act antitrust violations.  The district court ordered arbitration of all claims, holding that the international nature of the dispute required enforcement of the arbitration clause.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed as to the antitrust claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould an American court enforce an agreement to arbitrate antitrust claims when that agreement arises from an international transaction?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for a 5-4 majority, affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that claims arising under the Sherman Act and encompassed in a valid arbitration clause in an international commercial transaction are arbitrable under the federal Arbitration Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented, arguing that a fair construction of the arbitration clause does not encompass antitrust claims.  An arbitration clause should be construed to cover a remedy it does not expressly identify, and congress did not intend the federal Arbitration Act of apply to antitrust claims.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the dissent.

Public homosexual activity encompassed physical sexual acts while public homosexual conduct included advocating for or encouraging public or private homosexual activity.  The district court ruled in favor of the Board of Education, holding that the statute did not inhibit First Amendment freedoms, and the right of privacy did not include the activities prohibited by the statute.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit reversed in part, holding that the part of the statute that prohibited public homosexual conduct was unconstitutionally broad and attempted to regulate speech.  The court upheld that part of the statute prohibiting public homosexual activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the Oklahoma statute unconstitutionally infringe on protected free speech rights of public school teachers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was the Oklahoma statute so overbroad that it infringes on the protected free speech rights of public school teachers?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo answer.

Montoya de Hernandez’s passport revealed eight recent trips from Bogota to Miami or Los Angeles.  After further questioning, officials detained Montoya de Hernandez under suspicion that she was smuggling drugs in her alimentary canal.  After 16 hours of detention where Montoya de Hernandez did not speak or use the bathroom, officials obtained a court order for an x-ray and other tests.  At the hospital, a doctor removed a balloon filled with cocaine from her rectum.  Over the next four days, Montoya de Hernandez passed 88 balloons filled with cocaine, totaling 528 grams.  At trial, the district court admitted the cocaine into evidence and convicted Montoya de Hernandez on federal drug charges.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Montoya de Hernandez’s detention violated the Fourth Amendment because customs officials did not have a “clear indication” that she was smuggling drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCould Montoya de Hernandez be lawfully be detained for the period of four days by customs officials who reasonably suspected that she was attempting to smuggle illegal drugs in her body?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for a 7-2 majority, reversed the court of appeals.   The Supreme Court held that detention of a traveler at an international border is justified if customs agents reasonably suspect that the traveler is smuggling illegal drugs in their body.  The facts in this case supported that reasonable suspicion.  Given the manner in which the drugs were concealed, Montoya de Hernandez’s detention was not unreasonably long.  Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the judgment, writing that the detention was justified because Montoya de Hernandez refused to consent to the x-ray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brenan dissented, arguing that government officials should not have a lower standard for detaining someone at an international border than in the interior of the United States.  Indefinite detentions are only reasonable with approval of a magistrate, and that approval can only be given if there is probable cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37970,"name":"Peter Marvin Horstman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/peter_marvin_horstman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Horstman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"peter_marvin_horstman"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13459"},{"advocate":{"ID":15933,"name":"Mr. Andrew L.

When Hamilton Bank attempted to get a layout of the subdivision approved, the Williamson County Regional Planning Commission denied it because the layout violated certain zoning regulations. Hamilton Bank sued the Commission alleging that the zoning laws constituted a \"taking\" under the Fifth Amendment. At trial, the jury awarded Hamilton Bank $350,000 as compensation for the taking. The court issued an injunction against the Commission and awarded judgment notwithstanding the verdict denying money damages because the \"taking\" was only temporary. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the zoning laws denied Hamilton Bank all \"economically viable\" use of the land and that damages were required to compensate for the temporary taking.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a property owner entitled to money damages for the time during which zoning laws affect a temporary taking of the property?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo decision. In a 7-1 decision, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the majority, reversing and remanding to the lower court. The Supreme Court held that even if there was a temporary taking, a decision on money damages was premature because Hamilton Bank had not obtained a final administrative decision on the subdivision layout. The claim was premature under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for the same reason. Justice Byron R.

If a bank from one state seeks to acquire a bank, or substantially all of a bank\u0027s assets, from another state, the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA), 12 U.S.C. Section 1842(d), allows the Board to approve the acquisition only if it \"is specifically authorized by the statute laws of the State in which such [acquired] bank is located.\" Massachusetts and Connecticut have substantially similar laws allowing out-of-state banks to buy in-state banks only if the out-of-state banks (1) have their principal place of business in another New England State, and (2) the other New England State accords equivalent reciprocal privileges. Certain banks from outside of New England opposed the acquisitions, but the Board found that the Douglas Amendment did not prevent their authorization, and approved them.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Douglas Amendment permit states to allow banks only from certain other states to buy in-state banks, and, if so, do such state laws violate the Commerce, the Compact, or the Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes to part 1; no to part 2. Though the Douglas Amendment\u0027s language does not specifically indicate that a state may partially lift the ban on out-of-state banks acquiring in-state banks, the Amendment\u0027s legislative history indicates that Congress intended to allow each state such flexibility. Moreover, the Massachusetts and Connecticut laws favoring out-of-state banks from New England are consistent with the broader purpose underlying the BHCA: to retain local control over banking. As for the constitutionality of these state laws, there is no violation of the dormant Commerce Clause because Congress exercised its commerce power by enacting the BHCA and the Douglas Amendment. There is no violation of the Compact Clause because Massachusetts and Connecticut did not form a compact, and even if they did, they do not pose a threat to federal supremacy. Finally, there is no violation of the Equal Protection Clause because our country has traditionally favored widely dispersed control of banking, and so the concerns Massachusetts and Connecticut had with preserving the local nature of banking meet the traditional rational basis for judging equal protection claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35187,"name":"Laurence H.

Such safeguards include the right of the parents and guardians to participate in the development of an individual education program (IEP) and a procedure for the review of a proposed IEP if there is disagreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the spring of 1979, Michael Panico, who was considered to be “handicapped” under the meaning of the Act, was attending Memorial School, a public school in Burlington. His continued poor performance and the school’s inability to handle his needs led to a discussion between the school district and Michael’s parents about what changes needed to be made to his IEP. In June of 1979, the town presented the Panicos with an IEP that called for Michael to be placed at Pine Glen School. In the meantime, the Panicos had met with specialists at the Massachusetts General Hospital who recommended that Michael’s needs could best be served at the Carroll School in Lincoln, Massachusetts. The Panicos enrolled Michael at the Carroll School at their own expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Massachusetts Department of Education’s Bureau of Special Education Appeals (BSEA) held several hearings on the issue and determined that the town’s proposed placement was inappropriate and that the Carroll School was most adequately equipped to meet Michael’s needs. The BSEA ordered the town to pay for Michael’s tuition and transportation, as well as reimburse the Panicos for money already spent. The town sought judicial review in district court under federal and state statutes. The district court granted summary judgment against the town on the state law claim and set a date for trial on the federal claim. Because the town had refused to comply with the BSEA order, the Panicos and the state moved for preliminary injunctive relief. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the judgment in regards to the state law claim and held that none of the parties were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief because none could show irreparable injury. On remand, the district court found in favor of the town that the proposed IEP was appropriate and that the town should not be required to compensate the Panicos. The case was transferred to a different district judge to rule on the issue of whether or not the town should be required to pay the Panicos for costs incurred while the case was pending. The district court held that the Panicos’ decision to place Michael in the Carroll School without the town’s consent absolved the town of financial responsibility while the case was pending and ordered the Panicos to reimburse the town. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and held that the district court erred in conducting an entirely new trial, gave insufficient weight to the BSEA findings, and did not properly evaluate the IEP in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the Education of the Handicapped Act allow for reimbursement for private school tuition and transportation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does parental rejection of an IEP and the placement of the child in a private school without the agreement of local authorities bar such reimbursement?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the unanimous court. The Supreme Court held that the Education of the Handicapped Act grants the courts broad discretion in overseeing the administrative proceedings of IEP disputes that includes the ability to order reimbursement. Because the courts must ensure appropriate placement for the children in question, there may be situations in which all of the public school options are deemed inappropriate for the needs of a particular child. The Court also held that a reading of the Act that forces parents to waive their right to reimbursement if they place their child in an alternative school from the one recommended in the IEP would defeat the purpose of the Act. Parents who unilaterally change their child’s placement do so at their own financial risk, but they may be reimbursed if the placement is deemed to be the most appropriate available option.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20571,"name":"David Berman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/david_berman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Berman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"david_berman"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13476"},{"advocate":{"ID":21459,"name":"David W.

The Act stipulated that independent political action committees could not spend more than $1,000 to support the election of a presidential candidate. This case was decided together with Democratic Party v.

The Court held that the expenditures prohibited by the Federal Election Campaign Act were \"at the core of the First Amendment\" and could not be restricted by the government. The Court rejected the notion that the PACs\u0027 form of organization diminished their entitlement to First Amendment protection. The Court drew a distinction between contributions to candidates-- which were open to corruption--and contributions to independent organizations in support of candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20154,"name":"Charles Nevett Steele","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/charles_n_steele","view_count":0,"last_name":"Steele","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"charles_n_steele"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the Federal Election Commission","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13488"},{"advocate":{"ID":40552,"name":"Robert R.

CDCB was going through bankruptcy at the time and a trustee was appointed At a deposition related to the Commission\u0027s lawsuit, Gary Weintraub, CDCB\u0027s former counsel, refused to answer certain questions, citing attorney-client privilege. The Commission obtained a waiver of attorney-client privilege from the CDCB\u0027s bankruptcy trustee. The district court directed Weintraub to answer the questions, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that a bankruptcy trustee does not have the power to waive attorney-client privilege for communications that occurred before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the trustee of a corporation in bankruptcy have the power to waive that corporation\u0027s attorney-client privilege with respect to communications that took place before the bankruptcy petition was filed?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall, writing for a unanimous court, reversed the Seventh Circuit. The Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy trustee does have the power to waive attorney client privilege for communications that occurred before filing the bankruptcy petition. This power is held by the management of a corporation, and a bankruptcy trustee is merely a new form of management. If the power to waive attorney-client privilege remained with the corporation\u0027s directors, it would frustrate the goal of the trustee, to uncover fraud and misappropriated corporate assets.

After hiring him as a security guard, the board discovered that he had been convicted for grand larceny and without further consideration fired him for providing false information on his application. Since Loudermill qualified as a \"classified civil servant\" under Ohio law, he obtained a property right to his employment. This meant he could only be dismissed for cause and could obtain an administrative review of the causes for his termination. The Cleveland Civil Service Commission granted him an administrative review after his termination and found it valid. Loudermill filed suit in District Court alleging that the review system was unconstitutional because it only allowed him to respond to the charges against him after his termination. He argued that the board removed his property without giving him a chance to defend himself in violation of his right to Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court agreed that the Ohio statute gave Loudermill a property right to his job, but ruled that the board did not violate his due process rights because it followed the procedures specified by the same statute for removing the property right. In a similar case, Richard Donnelly alleged that post-dismissal hearings violated his due process rights. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit heard both cases together and ruled that the board violated both defendants\u0027 due process rights by removing their property rights to employment before providing an opportunity for them to respond to charges against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a state remove a civil servant\u0027s property rights to employment before providing an opportunity for that worker to respond to the charges offered for his termination?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron White authored the opinion for an 8-1 court. The Ohio statute clearly grants civil servants property rights to their employment. In order to lawfully remove this property, the Due Process Clause requires a procedure that carefully weighs the interests of the government in removing the property against the interests of the private party in retaining the property. This procedure must incorporate the \"essential requirements of due process,\" which \"are notice and an opportunity to respond.\" There was no strong reason to delay the opportunity to respond until after termination. The Court found that \"affording the employee an opportunity to respond prior to termination would impose neither a significant administrative burden nor intolerable delays.\" Accordingly, the significant interests of the employees to retain their jobs outweighed the interests of the state to remove employees quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39234,"name":"Robert M.

During a chase, police officer Elton Hymon shot 15-year-old Edward Eugene Garner with a hollow tip bullet to prevent Garner from escaping over a fence. Garner was suspected of burglarizing a nearby house. Hymon admitted that before he shot he saw no evidence that Garner was armed and \"figured\" he was unarmed. The bullet hit Garner in the back of the head. Garner was taken to the hospital where he died a short time later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarner\u0027s father sued seeking damages for violations of Garner\u0027s constitutional rights. The district court entered judgment for the defendants because Tennessee law authorized Hymon\u0027s actions. The court also felt that Garner had assumed the risk of being shot by recklessly attempting to escape. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that killing a fleeing suspect is a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment and such a seizure would only be reasonable if the suspect posed a threat to the safety of police officers or the community at large.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a statute authorizing use of deadly force to prevent the escape of any fleeing suspected felon violate the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 decision, Justice Byron R. White wrote for the majority affirming the court of appeals decision. The Fourth Amendment prohibits the use of deadly force unless it is necessary to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of violence to the officer or the community. The Tennessee statute was unconstitutional as far as it allowed deadly force to prevent the escape of an unarmed fleeing felon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor wrote a dissent stating that the majority went too far in invalidating long-standing common law and police practices contrary to the holding.

At trial, his behavior was so abnormal that the court ordered a prolonged mental examination to determine his competency to stand trial. After six months of examination, a state psychiatrist declared Ake unfit for trial and in need of a “maximum security facility.” Six weeks after this declaration, the same psychiatrist found that, when Ake was on his anti-psychotic medication, he was stable and competent to stand trial; the state resumed proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAke intended to assert the insanity defense, so a psychiatrist had to determine Ake’s mental state at the time of the killings. Because Ake could not afford to hire a psychiatrist, his attorney requested that the state provide him one. The court refused and rejected Ake’s argument that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the government to provide indigent defendants with a psychiatrist to allow them to raise a meaningful insanity defense. Without a psychiatrist, Ake was unable to provide any evidence as to his mental state at the time of the offense. Absent this evidence, jurors were instructed that Ake was to be presumed sane at the time of the offense. The jury subsequently rejected Ake’s insanity defense and convicted him on all counts. At the sentencing hearing, Ake—still unable to afford a psychiatrist—could not provide expert testimony to mitigate his offense and was sentenced to death. Ake appealed to the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals, which affirmed and held that the government was not responsible for providing psychiatric help to indigent defendants charged with capital crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn capital cases, does the Fourteenth Amendment require the government to provide an indigent defendant with the psychiatric assistance necessary to prepare an effective insanity defense?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the opinion for the 8-1 majority. The Court held that, when a defendant has made a preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense will be at issue during the trial, the Constitution requires the government to provide psychiatric assistance if the defendant cannot afford it. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires state-provided assistance in cases where there is a private interest that will be affected by the state’s actions, value that will be derived from the additional safeguards, and when providing the assistance will only be a minimal burden to the state. All three of these factors were present in this case. Furthermore, both justice and the Fourteenth Amendment require a defendant to be able to participate meaningfully in the judicial proceedings, which is impossible if the government were to deny this type of assistance to Ake and similar defendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a concurring opinion in which he noted that the Court’s decision applies only to capital cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which he, like Justice Burger, argued that this decision should apply only to capital cases.

Rose Marie Tuttle, Albert’s widow, sued the police officer and the city in district court under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which allows an individual to recover damages against a party who “acting under color of state law” deprives another of his constitutional rights. The district court instructed the jury that the city could be held liable only if the incident had been caused by a municipal “policy,” but a single, unusually excessive use of force could support a finding that the city was grossly negligent or deliberately indifferent in the training or supervision of its police force and was therefore liable under Section 1983. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the police officer but against the city and awarded Tuttle’s estate $1.5 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a single, isolated incident of the use of excessive force by a police officer establish an official policy or practice of a municipality that renders it liable for damages under Section 1983?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the four-justice plurality. The plurality held that the district court’s instructions to the jury improperly allowed a plaintiff to impose liability on the city without proof of a single action taken by a municipal policy maker. The plurality further concluded that proof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity is not sufficient to impose liability on a city for a policy that is not in and of itself unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which he argued that Section 1983 does not permit a city to be held liable on a theory of strict responsibility for its non-policy-making employees. Instead, municipalities are liable for constitutional deprivations caused by an official policy or custom. Because the jury could have found the city liable solely because the police officer’s actions were so excessive and out of the ordinary, Justice Brennan concurred with the judgment reached by the Court. Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent in which he argued that cities should be held liable under Section 1983 for the unconstitutional acts of their agents that are performed in the court of their official duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17496,"name":"Burk Bailey","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/burk_bailey","view_count":0,"last_name":"Bailey","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"burk_bailey"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13513"},{"advocate":{"ID":19145,"name":"Carl Hughes","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/carl_hughes","view_count":0,"last_name":"Hughes","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"carl_hughes"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13514"},{"advocate":{"ID":17413,"name":"Burck Bailey","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/burck_bailey","view_count":0,"last_name":"Bailey","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"burck_bailey"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13515"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":19085,"title":"Oral Argument - January 08, 1985","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/19085"}],"citation":{"volume":"471","page":"808","year":"1985","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/16985"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

During Abel’s trial, the prosecution called one of his accomplices, Kurt Ehle, to testify that Abel had participated in the robbery. To counter Ehle’s testimony, Abel called a mutual friend, Robert Mills, to the stand. Mills, Abel, and Ehle knew each other from the time they spent in prison together and their involvement in a prison gang, the Aryan Brotherhood. Mills testified that, in prison, Ehle had talked about his plans to rob the bank and blame it on Abel. To discredit Mills, the prosecution re-called Ehle to the stand to expose the three men’s involvement in the Brotherhood and the gang’s strict code of protection, which required members to lie, cheat, steal, and kill to protect a fellow member. Ehle testified that this code of conduct explained why Mills testified in defense of Abel. Abel’s counsel argued that this testimony was irrelevant, but the district court allowed it into evidence because the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have on Abel. Abel lost and appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed because admitting evidence that Mills belonged to a perjurious organization, to suggest he was committing perjury this time, unfairly prejudiced him by association absent any evidence of his individual willingness to lie. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the evidence regarding respondent’s and Mills’ membership in a prison gang unfairly impeach Mills and prejudice respondent by association?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the unanimous opinion, in which the Court held that the evidence of bias introduced for purposes of impeachment is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Relevant evidence is that which has the tendency to make the existence of any fact more or less probable. The Court determined that a showing of bias on the part of a witness would have a tendency to make the facts to which they testify less probable and is therefore relevant. Furthermore, the district court ensured the admission of only the highly probative evidence about the men’s involvement in the Brotherhood and sustained objections relating to the punishment of unfaithful members and other topics that might have been prejudicial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42180,"name":"Stephen S.

In 1979, she applied to take the 1980 New Hampshire Bar Examination and submitted her statement of intent to become a New Hampshire resident. Piper passed the New Hampshire Bar and was informed she would have to establish a home address in New Hampshire before being sworn in. In May 1980, Piper requested a dispensation from the residency requirement due to special circumstances and the fact that she met all of the other requirements. When her request was denied, she formally petitioned the New Hampshire Supreme Court to become a member of the bar. The New Hampshire Supreme Court denied her petition on December 31, 1980.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 22, 1982, Piper sued the New Hampshire Supreme Court in district court and argued that the residency requirement violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The district court granted Piper’s motion for summary judgment and found that the requirement violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the residency requirement for admission to the New Hampshire Bar violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 8-1 majority. The Court held that the Privileges and Immunities Clause was intended to create one economic union out of a collection of states, and so it was relevant to employment and business regulations. Specifically the legal profession plays a crucial rule in the national economy, and therefore the ability to practice should be considered a “fundamental right” that is protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The Court also held that, because a lawyer is not an officer of the State, there is no substantial reason for New Hampshire to exclude non-residents from the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a concurring opinion and argued that, other than the location of Piper’s home, there was nothing to distinguish her from any other New Hampshire lawyer. He found that the residency requirement should not apply in her case, but he did not think the majority’s opinion needed to reach any finding regarding the Constitutional validity of the residency requirement in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William H. Rehnquist argued that the practice of law differed from other professions in that it does not always readily translate across state lines, as laws and their enforcement often differ in different localities. He also argued that the state had substantial reasons to exclude out-of-state lawyers from the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31947,"name":"Jon Meyer","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jon_meyer","view_count":0,"last_name":"Meyer","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jon_meyer"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Appellee","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13592"},{"advocate":{"ID":35921,"name":"Martin L.

The Shared Time program offered classes during the school day that were intended to “supplement the core curriculum” of the private schools. The Shared Time teachers were full-time public school teachers, and many had previously worked in private schools. The Community Education program was offered for children and adults at many different sites, but the classes at issue took place after the school day in private elementary schools. The Community Education teachers were part-time public school employees, and many also held jobs at private schools. The classrooms for both programs were leased from the private schools. The vast majority of the participating private schools were religious, and there was no evidence that a public school student ever attended a Shared Time or Community Education class held in a private school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Six taxpayers filed suit against the school district and state officials and alleged that they violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by using public funds to pay for private (and religious) education. The district court applied the Lemon test and determined that, although the aim was secular, the effect of the programs conferred benefits to religious institutions and entangled the affairs of church and state. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the Shared Time and Community Education programs of the school district have the primary effect of advancing religion and therefore violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the statute failed the Lemon test because it had the effect of advancing religious agendas and it unnecessarily entangled the government and religion. The statute advanced religion in three ways: the teachers may inadvertently or intentionally instruct from a religious perspective; the programs themselves may serve as a symbolic link between the government and religion in the eyes of impressionable children; and the programs essentially serve as a government subsidy for religious instruction. The Court recognized that the intent of the programs was to provide secular education, but there was too great a risk of the religious environment influencing the children’s instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred in part and dissented in part. He agreed with the Court’s decision on the Community Education program, but dissented regarding the Shared Time program. He argued that there was no way to completely eliminate contact between the government and religion, and to attempt to do so in this case would come at the cost of children’s education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor concurred in part and dissented in part. She argued that there was no evidence to indicate a link between the Shared Time program and religion other than the fact that the classes were taught in private schools. In the case of the Community Education program, she agreed with the majority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissent where he argued that the Court has long engaged in an unnecessarily narrow reading of the Establishment Clause. He held that this decision and others like it were “contrary to the long-range interests of the country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice William H. Rehnquist also dissented and argued that the Establishment Clause was never meant to establish a “wall” between the government and religion but merely to prevent the establishment of a national religion, which these programs do not come close to doing. He also argued that there was no basis for the assumption that teaching secular topics in a religious school would effectively link the government and religion in the minds of schoolchildren.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36378,"name":"Michael W.

Watkinson drew his own weapon, and the two fired at each other. Watkinson was hit in the legs, and the other shooter was wounded on his left side and managed to run away. About 20 minutes later, the police found Rudolph Lee, Jr., bleeding from his left side, eight blocks away from Watkinson’s shop. The police took Lee to the same hospital Watkinson was in, and Watkinson identified Lee as his shooter. Lee was charged with attempted robbery, malicious wounding, and two counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commonwealth of Virginia filed a motion in state court to compel Lee to submit to surgery to recover the bullet still lodged in his side. The court granted the motion based on testimony that the surgery would be relatively noninvasive and accomplished without use of general anesthetic. The Virginia Supreme Court denied the appeal. Lee sued in district court on the ground that the surgery constituted an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment. The court issued a preliminary injunction. After presenting evidence that the surgery would be much more serious than the court originally thought, Lee asked for a rehearing in the state court, which was denied. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. Lee brought the case back to the district court, which ruled against the surgery. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment prevent a state from a forcing a suspect to undergo surgery in order to retrieve evidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that below-the-skin surgery represented such an infringement on the expectation of privacy that it must be justified by a compelling need for the evidence that might be produced. Since the state could not demonstrate a compelling need for the bullet in order to make the case against Lee, the Court held that the intrusion on Lee’s privacy vastly outweighed any state interest. Therefore, the surgery would be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun and Justice William H.
