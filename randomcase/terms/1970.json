The defendants filed for an injunction in federal court to prevent continuation of their case.  They argued that the New York laws violated due process, First Amendment freedoms, and equal protection.  The district court found the laws constitutional and refused to grant the injunction.  The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre the New York criminal anarchy laws unconstitutionally vague?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo decision.  Justice Hugo L. Black, writing for the unanimous Court, affirmed the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that the defendants would not suffer irreparable damages if the state trial continued.  The Court also held that the district court should not have evaluated the case on the merits because of the pending statute court proceedings.  Justice William O. Douglas concurred, writing that the New York laws were not obviously unconstitutional, so it was up to the state court to evaluate the matter.  Justice Potter Stewart wrote a separate concurrence, emphasizing that the majority decision dealt only with the proper procedure for a federal court to follow when a criminal prosecution is pending in state court.  Justice John M. Harlan joined in the concurrence.  Justice William J. Brennan concurred in the result, stating that the defendants did not allege bad-faith harassment by the prosecution, so an injunction would be improper.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43662,"name":"Victor Rabinowitz","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/victor_rabinowitz","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rabinowitz","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"victor_rabinowitz"},"advocate_description":"for the appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21919"},{"advocate":{"ID":22938,"name":"Eleanor Jackson Piel","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/eleanor_jackson_piel","view_count":0,"last_name":"Piel","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"eleanor_jackson_piel"},"advocate_description":"for the appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21920"},{"advocate":{"ID":24241,"name":"Frederick J.

Government agents listened to each of the radio transmissions, thereby overhearing defendant White make self-incriminating remarks regarding his involvement in multiple narcotics transactions.

That charge carried a possible sentence of life imprisonment or the death penalty.  Alford agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a second-degree murder conviction.  When Alford took the stand, he testified that he was innocent and pled guilty to avoid the death penalty.  The judge ensured that Alford made his decision freely after consulting counsel.  Alford maintained his guilty plea, and after receiving evidence of Alford’s extensive criminal history, the judge sentenced Alford to the maximum 30-year sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter unsuccessfully attempting to obtain post-conviction relief, Alford petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.  The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina denied relief on the grounds that Alford’s guilty plea was entirely voluntary.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the plea was involuntary because its primary motivation was the fear of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a guilty plea invalid where the defendant maintains his innocence and testifies that the plea is only to avoid the death penalty?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 6-3 decision, Justice Byron R. White wrote the majority opinion reversing the court of appeals.  The Supreme Court held that there was no constitutional violation where the defendant concluded based on competent counsel that it was in his best interest to plead guilty.  The court saw no difference between a defendant who maintains his innocence with a plea bargain and one who admits to the crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a concurrence, agreeing with the majority, but expressing a belief that \u003ci\u003eUnited States v Jackson\u003c/i\u003e was wrongly decided.  Justice William J. Brennan wrote a dissent, stating that the threat of the death penalty should be a factor considered when determining whether a plea was voluntary.  Justice William O.

Among the questions asked by the Arizona Bar Committee, she answered Question 25, which requested that she list all of the organizations to which she has belonged since the age of 16. She declined to answer Question 27, which asked whether she “had ever been a member of the Communist party or any organization ‘that advocates overthrow of the United States Government by force or violence.’” Because she did not answer that question, the Committee did not process her application any further. The Arizona Supreme Court denied Baird’s petition for the Bar Committee to show cause why she should be denied admittance to the State Bar of Arizona. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment protect against state inquiries into personal beliefs for the purpose of excluding a person from a profession?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Hugo L. Black delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the First Amendment protection of freedom of association prevents a state from denying a person access to a profession based on the exercise of that right. In order for a state to investigate a person’s beliefs for the sake of employment, the state must show the inquiry is necessary “to protect a legitimate state interest.” The Court held that the petitioner had already provided the Bar Committee with enough relevant information about her membership in associations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion where he argued that such a state inquiry must distinguish between being a member of an organization and actively supporting the actions of an anti-governmental group.  He also held that the question on the State Bar Application was unconstitutional because it was clearly used to deny admission to the Bar based on objectionable beliefs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion. He argued that the First Amendment allows a state to make inquiries into the beliefs that will directly impact a professional’s ability to perform the duties of the job. Because a lawyer is an officer of the court, beliefs regarding the government are relevant to the Bar Committee’s inquiry. He wrote that, although being a lawyer is a privilege and not a right, nothing indicated that the Bar Committee would have refused Baird admission to the Bar had she answered the question in the affirmative. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice John M. Harlan, and Justice Byron R. White joined in the dissent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Byron R. White wrote that state Bars had a legitimate interest in preventing applicants who wish to overthrow the United States government from practicing law. He argued that there was no constitutional basis to prevent a state from making relevant inquiries into beliefs that could influence an applicant’s performance of his/her duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37752,"name":"Peter D.

In his application, he answered several questions about his social, religious and political affiliations. When Stolar applied to the Ohio Bar in 1969 he supplied the Ohio Bar Association with all of the information from his New York Bar application. The Ohio Bar also subjected Stolar to an oral interrogation where they asked questions relating to whether he was associated with any organization that advocated the violent overthrow of the government. Stolar refused to answer those questions and the interrogation committee recommended that he be denied admission to the Bar. Stolar had nothing in his record, other than refusal to answer the questions, that showed that he did not have the necessary good character for admission to the Ohio Bar. The Ohio Supreme Court approved the committee’s recommendation without opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the Ohio Bar’s requirement that applicants answer questions about possible Communist Party affiliation violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Though they could not agree on an opinion, five members of the court agreed that the Ohio Bar’s questions violated the First Amendment.  Justice Hugo L. Black delivered the judgment of the court, holding that the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of association and prohibition against a state penalizing a person for their membership in a particular organization made the Ohio Bar questions improper.  Justice Potter Stewart concurred in the judgment, writing that the questions were improper under prior Supreme Court precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White dissented, arguing that the Constitution did not require a state to admit someone to practice law who believed in violence.  The Ohio Bar questions were properly designed to discover whether an applicant expected to actively support illegal violence.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun also dissented, stating that the judgment should be affirmed based on Stolar’s refusal to answer the questions.  Chief Justice Warren Burger, Justice John M. Harlan, and Justice Byron R. White joined in the dissent.  Justice John M. Harlan separately dissented, arguing that the Constitution does prevent a state bar association from denying admission based on theoretical beliefs in a right of revolution, but it does not require admission of someone who seeks entry for the purpose of doing away with the orderly process of law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34199,"name":"Leonard B.

One section of it focused on police brutality and made reference to the Supreme Court case \u003cem\u003eMonroe v. Pape\u003c/em\u003e. The case was based on allegations that Detective Pape and other officers broke into the Monroe apartment, assaulted the Monroes, and took Mr. Monroe to the police station where he was held for ten hours without being charged or advised of his procedural rights. A week after the report was released, Time Magazine published an article that quoted extensively from the report’s coverage of the allegations without ever explicitly stating that they were allegations rather than findings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePape sued Time, Inc. for libel in district court and Time moved for dismissal. The district court granted the motion, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and remanded the case. In the intervening time, the Supreme Court decided \u003cem\u003eNew York Times v. Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e, which stated that a public official may not recover damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his or her official conduct unless there is evidence the statements were made with actual malice. This decision became the basis for the district court granting summary judgment for Time, Inc. The Court of Appeals again reversed, and held that a jury must decide whether actual malice was present. After the third trial, the district court granted Time, Inc.’s motion for a directed verdict. The Court of Appeals reversed for a third time and held that the issue of actual malice was one for the jury to decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit correctly apply the precedent established by \u003cem\u003eNew York Times v. Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion for the 8-1 majority. The Court held that the Time article was reporting on the Commission’s description of the allegations Monroe made against Pape, of which there was no inherent truth value. By not including the word “alleged” or a synonym, Time adopted one of multiple available interpretations, which is not enough to create a jury issue of “malice” under \u003cem\u003eNew York Times v. Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e. The Court held that the Time article reflected an error in judgment, not a reckless disregard of the truth, and the statements are protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice John M. Harlan wrote that the Supreme Court’s judgment of the specific facts of this case is unwarranted. He argued that, if the Court were to treat each case in this way, it would quickly become ineffective as a judicial body. He also argued that doing so would result in an overreach of the Court’s power that would infringe on the states’ rights to regulate defamation laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21443,"name":"Don H.

Griggs challenged Duke\u0027s \"inside\" transfer policy, requiring employees who want to work in all but the company\u0027s lowest paying Labor Department to register a minimum score on two separate aptitude tests in addition to having a high school education. Griggs claimed that Duke\u0027s policy discriminated against African-American employees in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. On appeal from a district court\u0027s dismissal of the claim, the Court of Appeals found no discriminatory practices. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Duke Power Company\u0027s intradepartmental transfer policy, requiring a high school education and the achievement of minimum scores on two separate aptitude tests, violate Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. After noting that Title VII of the Act intended to achieve equality of employment opportunities, the Court held that Duke\u0027s standardized testing requirement prevented a disproportionate number of African-American employees from being hired by, and advancing to higher-paying departments within, the company. Neither the high school graduation requirement nor the two aptitude tests was directed or intended to measure an employee\u0027s ability to learn or perform a particular job or category of jobs within the company. The Court concluded that the subtle, illegal, purpose of these requirements was to safeguard Duke\u0027s long-standing policy of giving job preferences to its white employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30616,"name":"Jack Greenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_greenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_greenberg"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22449"},{"advocate":{"ID":25265,"name":"George W.

R.G. Grady, a citizen of Tennessee, was driving the plaintiffs in the suit along a public highway, when the defendants, acting under the misconception that Grady worked for the organization Civil Rights for Negroes, allegedly pulled their truck into the path of Grady\u0027s car, causing him to stop. The defendants were accused of forcing Grady and his passengers to step out of the car and preventing their escape. According to the plaintiffs, the defendant James Calvin Breckenridge proceeded to beat Grady and the plaintiffs in the head with a club, injuring them. The defendants also threatened the plaintiffs verbally and pointed firearms at them. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi dismissed the plaintiffs\u0027 complaint, basing their decision on a previous case, \u003cem\u003eCollins v. Hardyman\u003c/em\u003e. This case limited section 1985 subsection 3 to apply only to conspiracies somehow related to state laws or state officials, to avoid possible conflict with the U.S. Constitution. The Court of Appeals agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1) What is the scope and constitutionality, primarily with respect to section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment in relation to section 1985 subsection 3? 2) Did the defendants of the civil suit disobey the statute?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court concluded that section 1985 subsection 3 covers conspiracy among private parties, uninvolved in official government business because three indicators pointed to that conclusion: the actual text of the law, the law in relation to the parent law upon which it was based, and the way in which the law had been interpreted in the past. The Court found that the conspirators must intend to deprive someone from a particular demographic group of equal rights to be in violation of section 1985 subsection 3. When these requirements are met, Congress can punish conspirators while acting in compliance with section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment without the limitations of \u003cem\u003eCollins v. Hardyman\u003c/em\u003e. Finally, the Court ruled that, in the civil suit, the defendants did conspire to commit the assault with the purpose of infringing on the plaintiffs\u0027 legal rights because of their race. And, the plaintiffs suffered personal injuries as a result. Thus, the previous judgment is reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":16595,"title":"Oral Argument - January 14, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/16595"},{"id":17319,"title":"Oral Argument - January 13, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/17319"}],"citation":{"volume":"403","page":"88","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26815"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The grants were to be used for the construction of non-religious school facilities. The Act also stipulated that twenty years after the grant had been given, schools were free to use the buildings for any purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Act violate the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that only the 20-year limitation portion of the Act violated the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. The Court invalidated the 20-year clause, arguing that subsidizing the construction of facilities used for non-secular purposes would have the effect of advancing religion. The Court held that the church-related institutions in question had not used their federally-funded facilities for religious activities, and that the facilities were \"indistinguishable from a typical state university facility.\" The Court also held that the Act did not excessively entangle the government with religion, noting that college students were less susceptible to religious indoctrination, that the aid was of \"nonideological character,\" and that one-time grants did not require constant state surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15635,"title":"Oral Argument - March 02, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15635"},{"id":15797,"title":"Oral Argument - March 03, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15797"}],"citation":{"volume":"403","page":"672","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26817"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The affidavit stated that Harris had a reputation with the investigator for being a trafficker in illegal liquor, and a local constable located illegal whiskey on Harris’ property.  The constable had purchased whiskey from Harris in the past and feared for his life if his name were revealed.  When police searched Harris’ residence, they discovered illegal non-tax paid liquor.  At trial, the district court admitted the evidence obtained during the search, and Harris was convicted of possession of non-tax paid liquor.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the conviction, holding that the investigators affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause for the search.  This made the search illegal and any evidence obtained during the search inadmissible at trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the investigator’s affidavit provide sufficient probable cause to issue a search warrant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for a 5-4 majority, delivered the opinion of the court. The Supreme Court held that the affidavit provided enough probable cause to issue a search warrant.  In Part I, Chief Justice Burger expressed that the affidavit provided a factual basis for the search because of the investigator\u0027s personal knowledge of Harris.  In Part II, Chief Justice Burger wrote that the investigator\u0027s knowledge of Harris’ reputation provided reliability for the constable’s information.  In Part III expressed that the constable’s statements could be trusted because they were against his penal interest.  Justices Hugo L. Black and Harry A. Blackmun joined in the entirety of the majority opinion and concurred, writing that they would overrule the cases the Sixth Circuit relied on.  Justice Potter Stewart joined in Part I, and concurred in the judgment.  Justice Byron R White joined in Part III, and concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan dissented, writing that the investigator’s affidavit did not provide probable cause to issue a search warrant.  Justices William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18001,"name":"Beatrice Rosenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/beatrice_rosenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rosenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"beatrice_rosenberg"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21874"},{"advocate":{"ID":42193,"name":"Steven M.

The agents handcuffed Bivens in front of his wife and children and arrested him on narcotics charges.  Later, the agents interrogated Bivens and subjected him to a visual strip search.  Bivens sued the agents for $15,000 in damages each for humiliation and mental suffering.  The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does violation of an individual’s Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure give rise to a federal claim for damages?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does governmental privilege extend to federal agents who clearly violate constitutional rights and act outside their authority?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No answer.  Justice William J. Brennan Jr., writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed the Second Circuit and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that Bivens does have a cause of action for damages arising from the federal agents Fourth Amendment violations.  Bivens must provide proof of his injuries in order to recover.  The Court did not reach the privilege question because the Court of Appeals did not consider the question.  Justice John M. Harlan concurred in the judgment, writing that federal courts have the power to award damages for constitutional violations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented, arguing that the doctrine of separation of powers is better served by leaving the question to Congress.  He also argued that the doctrine of suppressing evidence obtained in illegal searches is insufficient to deter law enforcement.  Justice Hugo L. Black also dissented, arguing that Congress could create the cause of action Bivens stated, but has not, so the majority’s decision is an unconstitutional extension of judicial power.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented, supporting the idea that the question in this case is better left to Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41348,"name":"Stephen A.

The first involves Joseph McKeiver and Edward Terry, fifteen and sixteen year old boys charged with acts of robbery, theft, assault, and escape. At trial before the Juvenile Court of Philadelphia, each was denied a request for a jury trial. A Superior Court affirmed the order, and, after consolidation of their cases, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did likewise, saying there was no constitutional right to a jury trial for juveniles. \u003cem\u003eIn re Burrus\u003c/em\u003e concerns the consolidated cases of more than forty juveniles ranging in age from eleven to fifteen. Most of the juveniles faced misdemeanor charges stemming from protests of school consolidations that took place in November and December, 1968 during which, on six different occasions, they blocked traffic and refused to clear the roadway. Additionally, one sixteen-year-old juvenile faced charges of disorderly conduct for an incident that occurred at the local school. In each case, the judge denied a request for a jury trial. The Court of Appeals and Supreme Court of North Carolina both affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision, finding no constitutional requirement for a jury trial for juvenile defendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, as applied to the states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, apply to juveniles?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 plurality opinion authored by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court concluded that the previous application of other criminal rights to juveniles, like rights to counsel and cross-examination, was done out of an emphasis on factfinding. \"But one cannot say that in our legal system the jury is a necessary component of accurate factfinding.\" Additionally, the Court noted that, because juvenile prosecution is not considered either civil or criminal, the whole of the Sixth Amendment does not necessarily apply. As such, there is no requirement for a jury trial in juvenile cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63026,"name":"Damel E.

When the police applied for a warrant to search suspect Edward Coolidge\u0027s automobile, the Attorney General, acting as a justice of the peace, authorized it. Additionally, local police had taken items from Coolidge\u0027s home during the course of an interview with the suspect\u0027s wife. Coolidge was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the searches of Coolidge\u0027s home and automobile violate the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a decision in which a number of justices chose to concur in part and dissent in part, the Court held that the searches and seizures of Coolidge\u0027s property were unconstitutional. Justice Stewart\u0027s opinion held that the warrant authorizing the seizure of Coolidge\u0027s automobile was invalid because it was not issued by a \"neutral and detatched magistrate.\" Stewart also rejected New Hampshire\u0027s arguments in favor of making an exception to the warrant requirement. Stewart held that neither the \"incident to arrest\" doctrine nor the \"plain view\" doctrine justified the search, and that an \"automobile exception\" was inapplicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":16912,"title":"Oral Argument - January 12, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/16912"}],"citation":{"volume":"403","page":"443","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26841"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The states of Oregon, Arizona, Idaho, and Texas sued, and argued that these Amendments infringe on rights the Constitution reserves for the states.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 infringe on the rights the Constitution reserves for the states?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes in part and no in part. Justice Hugo L. Black delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that Congress had the power to enact the amendments that changed the voting age for federal elections, abolish literary tests at the polling station, and abolish state residency requirements for presidential and vice presidential election. However, the Court held that lowering the voting age for state and local election was beyond Congressional purview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that the Framers intended for Article I Section 4 of the Constitution and the Necessary and Proper Clause to grant the States the power to make the laws that govern elections and for Congress to have the power to alter the laws if necessary. The Court also held that the legislative history surrounding the enactment and enforcement of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Nineteenth Amendments support the role that Congress plays in preventing racial discrimination in the electorate without denying the states their rights. Without evidence that the states use the 21-year-old voting requirement to discriminate based on race in state and local elections, Congress does not have the right to intervene. The Court held that the literacy test bans were constitutional under the enforcement clause of the Fifteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas concurred in part and dissented in part. He disagreed with the majority’s ruling in regards to reducing the voting age in state and local elections. He argued that, because voting is a “fundamental right,” which Congress ensures under the Equal Protection Clause, Congress could legislate voting age at the state level as well as the federal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan concurred in part and dissented in part. He agreed with the majority’s opinion that Congress could prohibit literacy tests but disagreed on the issue of Congress’ ability to impose regulations on voting age and state residency requirements. He argued that the legislative history surrounding the Fourteenth Amendment supported the preeminence of the right of the states to legislate voting. Since the Constitution does not explicitly grant Congress the right to legislate voting requirements, the right is reserved to the states. Without evidence that people between 18 and 21 and people who do not meet state residency requirements are being unconstitutionally discriminated against, Congress cannot intervene. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Byron R. White, and Justice Thurgood Marshall authored an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. They disagreed with the majority’s opinion that Congress cannot legislate voting age in state and local elections. They argued that, while the states have the right to determine qualifications for voting, Congress has the right to legislate the exercise of this power under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since 18-year-olds are treated as full adults under other aspects of the law, there is evidence that 18- to 21-year-olds are being denied voting rights to which they are entitled, and Congress has every right to intervene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart also wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He disagreed with the majority’s opinion that Congress could legislate voting laws in federal elections. He wrote that the Framers clearly intended the right to legislate voting to be reserved for the states and that the Constitution does not allow Congress to supersede that right without a compelling interest. He argued that the age qualification did not represent a compelling interest to allow Congress to enact legislation on the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34663,"name":"Lee Johnson","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/lee_johnson","view_count":0,"last_name":"Johnson","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"lee_johnson"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners, for Oregon","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21775"},{"advocate":{"ID":22386,"name":"Erwin N.

The star witness at trial was Atchley’s insurance agent. The agent met with Atchley after his arrest to talk about the life insurance policy on his wife. During this conversation Atchley admitted to lying in wait for his wife with a gun, but said that the shooting was an accident.  After notifying police, the insurance agent returned with a hidden recording device. Atchley made the same admission. Over Atchley’s objection the tape was admitted at trial. The Supreme Court of California affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtchley then sought habeus corpus relief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, arguing that the tape was an unconstitutional involuntary confession. The district court agreed, ordering a new hearing on the issue of voluntariness. The district court held that the trial could not have reliably determined whether the confession was voluntary. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court err in refusing to apply a presumption of correctness to the California state courts’ finding that Atchley’s tape recorded statement was voluntary?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart, writing for eight members of the court, delivered the majority opinion. The Supreme Court held that an applicant for habeus corpus is not entitled to a new hearing on voluntariness unless he can show that his version of events, if true, would require the conclusion that the confession was involuntary. In this case, Atchley did not do that. He merely pointed to shortcomings in the trial court procedures. The trial court had given full consideration to the issue of voluntariness and applied the correct constitutional standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L.

The plaintiffs claimed that this plan violated the children’s constitutional rights under the Supreme Court’s decision in \u003cem\u003eBrown v. Topeka Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e as well as a North Carolina state statute that prohibited districts from assigning children to schools based on race. The state court issued the injunction, and the defendants moved the case to federal court by arguing that, because the issues in the case dealt with the U.S. Constitution, the federal court had jurisdiction. The district court heard arguments in this case with a similar one, \u003cem\u003eSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e, and subsequently struck down the state court injunction by holding that the state statute was unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a school district policy that seeks to desegregate a public school district unconstitutional and in violation of a statute that forbids a public school from making distinctions in regards to students based on their race?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because, at oral arguments, both litigants argued that the state statute forbidding the assignment of children to schools based on race was constitutional.

In addition, the Bar required the creation of Committees on Character and Fitness to determine whether an applicant “possesses the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law.” The Committees required two affidavits in support of the applicant and a questionnaire filled out by the applicant. The petitioners were organizations and individuals representing a class of law students and recent law school graduates who sued two of the Committees by claiming that the vague and overbroad questions violated the applicants’ First Amendment rights. The questions related to the applicants’ political beliefs, membership in political association, and loyalty to the United States Constitution. A three-judge panel of the district court granted partial relief with respect to specific questions but sustained the validity of the New York system as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the New York system for admission to the state bar violate applicants’ First Amendment rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the character and fitness requirement has long been understood to refer to conduct which would be dishonorable in a legal setting and therefore is not overbroad. The Court also held that there was no burden of proof placed on the applicant, and there was no evidence of any intent to penalize political beliefs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that a state had every right to refuse entrance to the bar to any applicant who professed a desire to overthrow the government or belonged to a group with those goals. While the First Amendment protects the applicants from being refused admission based on unpopular beliefs, it does not prevent them from being questioned about relevant issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that, when depriving an applicant of her right to practice law, a State must be held to a higher standard than when the state wishes to deprive someone of property. Because a state would never ask the same questions of a potential homeowner, the questions are not appropriate in a legal professional context either. Justice Black argued that, even if an applicant were to profess allegiance to a group that wishes to overthrow the government, those beliefs are protected by the First Amendment. Justice William O. Douglas joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissent, Justice Thurgood Marshall argued that the techniques the New York Committees use are intended to weed out political undesirables. He also argued that past practice illustrates that the understanding of the phrase is not narrow enough to prevent First Amendment violations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37075,"name":"Norman Dorsen","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/norman_dorsen","view_count":0,"last_name":"Dorsen","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"norman_dorsen"},"advocate_description":"for the appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21780"},{"advocate":{"ID":21349,"name":"David W.

Prior to this order, a suit had been filed in state court that sought an order enjoining the use of public funds for the transportation of students for desegregation purposes. In the midst of the extensive litigation, the North Carolina legislature enacted an anti-busing bill. Swann and other plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief against the statute, and a three-judge panel was convened to consider the issue. The three-judge panel declared the statute unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the North Carolina anti-busing law violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Court held that, while state officials have a great deal of discretion in formulating school policy, that discretion does not override federal constitutional guarantees. The anti-busing statute flies in the face of the Court’s holding in Brown v. Board of Education and the requirement to provide desegregated education.

The arresting officers seized the material in question.  While the state court proceedings were underway, Perez, and the others arrested, sued in federal district court for a declaration that the statute and the ordinance were unconstitutional.  A three-judge court convened and upheld the Louisiana statute, but found the arrests and seizure of materials invalid.  The court prohibited use of the seized materials in the state criminal proceedings.  The court noted that it had no jurisdiction to consider the ordinance, but expressed that it was probably invalid.  A single federal judge later ruled the ordinance invalid.  Local law enforcement officers directly appealed the district court decisions to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court err when it convened a three-judge court and ruled on the validity of the arrests and seizure of materials while the state criminal proceedings were still pending?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Hugo L. Black, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed in part and remanded the case.  The Supreme Court held that the district court’s ruling on the validity of the arrests and seizure constituted improper federal interference with state criminal proceedings.  The Court reversed that judgment.  The Court also held that it had no jurisdiction to review the order declaring the ordinance invalid on direct appeal.  Justice Potter Stewart concurred, citing several cases in support of his decision.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the concurrence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented in part, agreeing that the court had no jurisdiction to review the ordinance, but disagreeing on the district court’s arrest and seizure ruling.  Justice William J. Brennan also dissented in part, agreeing with the majority on reversing the three-judge court, but disagreeing about the Supreme Court’s ability to review the decision on the ordinance.  Justice Byron R. White and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in this dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19427,"name":"Charles H.

In 1969, Carmen Richardson, a resident alien of Arizona who met all requirements for welfare eligibility except the residency requirement, filed a class action lawsuit against the Commissioner of the State\u0027s Department of Public Welfare questioning the constitutionality of that requirement. The three-judge court in the District of Arizona found in favor of Richardson, but the Commissioner appealed. In the same year, a similar class action suit was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In this case, resident aliens of Pennsylvania challenged state law which dictated that if a Pennsylvania resident did not qualify for federal aid then he or she could only receive welfare benefits from the state if he or she were a citizen or had applied for citizenship. This three-judge court also found in favor of the resident aliens. However, one judge disagreed, and the defendants, namely the Executive Director of the Philadelphia County Board of Assistance and the Secretary of the Commonwealth\u0027s Department of Public Welfare, appealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state, like Arizona or Pennsylvania, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it denies welfare benefits to those who are not United States citizens or to aliens who have not lived in this country for a certain number of years?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court asserted that to classify state residents solely based on alienage was inherently questionable, because aliens constitute a minority, separate from the rest of the population. The Court conceded that there had been instances in which state laws could treat citizens and non-citizens differently. However, it maintained that a state\u0027s aim to conserve welfare benefits for citizens would not legitimize the denial of welfare benefits to aliens. Their justification was that the aliens pay taxes and, consequently, contribute to the pool of money from which welfare benefits are drawn. As a result, the Supreme Court concluded that the welfare benefit restrictions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":17807,"title":"Oral Argument - March 22, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/17807"},{"id":23673,"title":"Oral Argument - March 22, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23673"}],"citation":{"volume":"403","page":"365","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26894"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Police arrested him at his home on obscenity charges and seized several of the magazines.  A local news broadcast, run by Metromedia, Inc., reported on the arrest, but failed to use the words “allegedly” or “reportedly” in during one broadcast.  In subsequent broadcasts, the reporters called Rosenbloom and other similar distributors “girlie look peddlers” and “smut distributors”.  Eventually, Rosenbloom was acquitted on the obscenity charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosenbloom then sued Metromedia for libel.  The district court held that the First Amendment standard, which allowed recovery of damages only for knowingly and recklessly false statements, did not apply because Rosenbloom was not a public official or figure.  The court instead instructed the jury to award damages where Metromedia did not use reasonable care to discern the truth before broadcasting.  The jury awarded Rosenbloom general and punitive damages, although the district court reduced the punitive damages.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the knowingly and recklessly false standard applied.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Should the knowingly and recklessly false standard for defamatory statements apply to private individuals?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) If so, is the evidence presented at trial enough to support the damages originally awarded to Rosenbloom?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No.  In a 5-3 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the judgment of the court affirming the Third Circuit decision.  The Supreme Court held that the knowingly and recklessly false standard applied because the story was a matter of public concern.  It did not matter that Rosenbloom was a private citizen.  The Court also held that the evidence in the case did not support the damages award under the proper constitutional standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a special concurrence, stating that the First Amendment protected the news media from libel judgments even where the broadcaster knows their statements were false.  Justice Byron R. White also wrote a special concurrence, asserting that the press have the privilege to comment on official actions of public servants, such as the police, in full detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a dissent, expressing that states should be free to impose a duty of reasonable care in defamation actions involving private citizens.  He would remand the case for further consideration of whether Rosenbloom sustained actual harm and whether Metromedia acted with actual malice.  Justice Thurgood Marshall also wrote a dissent, stating that the court should limit damages in libel actions by private citizens to actual losses.  Justice William O. Douglas did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38940,"name":"Ramsey Clark","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/ramsey_clark","view_count":0,"last_name":"Clark","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"ramsey_clark"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22034"},{"advocate":{"ID":18058,"name":"Bernard G.

Shortly after Maurice\u0027s birth, Barbara James applied for assistance under New York State\u0027s Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). James began receiving assistance after a caseworker visited her apartment. Two years later, James was scheduled to be visited again by a caseworker. This visit was required under New York State law and would affect her benefits under AFDC. She refused to allow this visit. In a procedural hearing, she continued her refusal, and her AFDC assistance was terminated by New York State as a result. James then filed suit under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the caseworker visit was a search and would violate her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The District Court ruled in her favor. New York appealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid New York violate James\u0027 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in terminating her AFDC benefits when she refused the caseworker visit?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion, the Court held that a caseworker visit was not a \"search\" under the Fourth Amendment. Writing for the majority, Justice Harry A. Blackmun reasoned that \"the visitation in itself is not forced or compelled,\" and as a result, \"there is no entry of the home and there is no search.\" Even if the caseworker visit \"does possess some of the characteristics of a search in the traditional sense,\" the visit still would not violate the Fourth Amendment, under the unreasonableness standard set forth in \u003cem\u003eTerry v. Ohio\u003c/em\u003e. The Court concluded that the caseworker visit was not unreasonable, as the visit allowed the state to focus on the child and to ensure that its welfare funds were being used properly. Moreover, the visit was not confrontational and James\u0027 refusal did not lead to criminal prosecution. Justice Byron R. White concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":17272,"title":"Oral Argument - October 20, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/17272"}],"citation":{"volume":"400","page":"309","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26902"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Justice White argued that a minority opposing conviction does not prevent the other jurors from reaching their decisions beyond a reasonable doubt.

(Martin) informed Ida Phillips that it was not accepting job applications from women with preschool-age children; however, at this time, Martin employed men with preschool-age children. Phillips sued and alleged she had been denied employment because of her sex in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment by holding that, because seventy-five to eighty percent of the applicants hired for the position for which Phillips applied were women, there was insufficient evidence that there was bias against women. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a refusal to hire women with preschool-age children while hiring men with such children, in the absence of business necessity, violate of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn the absence of evidence that having preschool-age children is demonstrably more relevant to female job performance than to male job performance, refusal to hire women with preschool-age children violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 required that persons with similar qualifications be given equal employment opportunities regardless of their sex. Because there was inadequate evidence to determine whether having preschool-age children was actually relevant to the business qualifications of the female candidates, the Court held that summary judgment was inappropriate in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires uniform minimum qualifications for both male and female candidates. The exception for qualifications that may be different based on actual business necessity was only intended to apply to jobs that require specific physical characteristics; it was not intended to justify stereotypical characterizations of traditional gender roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45962,"name":"William L.

The increases were issued at the request of several railroads because of a need for revenue to offset increased operating costs.  Seven public utilities, who use large amounts of bituminous coal, sued to enjoin and set aside the order, claiming that the rates were unreasonable and the ICC’s order deprived them of due process of law.  Several state departments of agriculture intervened as parties plaintiff, and several railroads intervened in support of the ICC.  The district court granted the ICC’s motion to dismiss, holding that the utilities failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Interstate Commerce Act.

Clay then took an administrative appeal to the Kentucky Appeal Board, which tentatively classified him I-A, or eligible for unrestricted military service, and referred his file to the Justice Department for an advisory recommendation. The Justice Department concluded, contrary to a hearing officer\u0027s recommendation, that Clay\u0027s claim should be denied. The Department wrote that Clay did not meet any of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status; that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form, that this opposition is based upon religious training and belief, and that this objection is sincere. Subsequently, the Appeal Board denied Clay\u0027s claim, but without stating its reasons. When Clay refused to report for induction, he was tried and convicted of willful refusal to submit to induction. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Cassius Clay\u0027s induction notice invalid because it was grounded upon an erroneous denial of his claim to be classified as a conscientious objector?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that since the Appeal Board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to Clay, and that it was impossible to determine on which of the three grounds offered in the Justice Department\u0027s letter that board relied, Clay\u0027s conviction must be reversed. The Court reasoned that Clay satisfied the first two tests of conscientious objection. Regarding the third test, the Court concluded that whether or not Clay met the test of conscientious objection to war in any form, it was not clear that the Appeal Board relied on some legitimate ground in denying the claim, and therefore the conviction could not stand. In separate opinions, Justices William O. Douglas and John M. Harlan concurred. Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":16975,"title":"Oral Argument - April 19, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/16975"}],"citation":{"volume":"403","page":"698","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26917"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Connell was employed as a substitute teacher, and later dismissed from her position for refusing to sign the loyalty oath required of all Florida public employees. The oath stated that the employees “will support the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Florida” and “do not believe in the overthrow of the government of the United States or of the State of Florida by force or violence.” The district court held that the provision of the oath that employees will support the Constitution is valid, but the provision not to overthrow the government is unconstitutional. Connell appealed directly to the Supreme Court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the requirement of a pledge to support the Constitution of the United States and the state invalid? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes a school board’s decision to dismiss an employee based on the refusal to sign the loyalty oath denying belief in the overthrow of the United States government or that of the state violate the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that requiring all employee applicants to pledge to support the federal Constitution and that of the state was valid because it demands no more than what is required of all state and federal employees. However, the Court held the dismissal from public employment for refusing to sign the oath without hearing or inquiry violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a concurring opinion in which he stated the “overthrow” clause of the oath was invalid because the state could not show that an applicant believed in an overthrow. Justice William O. Douglas and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the concurrence. Justice Potter Stewart wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he agreed the with the validity of the section of the oath that required support of the federal and state Constitutions. However, Justice Stewart would remand the case to discover the state’s meaning behind the “overthrow” clause. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41969,"name":"Sanford Jay Rosen","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sanford_jay_rosen","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rosen","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"sanford_jay_rosen"},"advocate_description":"For the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21522"},{"advocate":{"ID":42110,"name":"Stephen Marc Slepin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/stephen_marc_slepin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Slepin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"stephen_marc_slepin"},"advocate_description":"For the appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21523"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":17288,"title":"Oral Argument - November 19, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/17288"}],"citation":{"volume":"403","page":"207","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26919"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Zenith counterclaimed, alleging anti-trust violations, misuse of patents, and a conspiracy to restrain trade in Canada, England, and Australia. Zenith asked for treble damages and injunctive relief. Zenith contended that Hazeltine\u0027s license forced them to pay for use of unpatented products and that Hazeltine had illegally conspired with foreign patent pools to prevent Zenith from expanding into those markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore trial, Zenith had stipulated that Hazeltine and its parent corporation were one entity for the purposes of litigation. The District Court entered judgment against Hazeltine and its parent corporation, awarding Zenith treble damages and injunctive relief. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the damages award, but otherwise reversed the District Court\u0027s judgment. The Court of Appeals vacated all judgments against Hazeltine\u0027s parent corporation because Zenith\u0027s pretrial stipulation did not properly designate the parent corporation as a party to the litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould Hazeltine\u0027s parent corporation be bound by the District Court\u0027s judgment? Was Zenith injured by Hazeltine\u0027s conspiracy with foreign patent pools?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Yes as to Canada. In a 7-1 decision Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the court, affirming the Court of Appeals decision to vacate the judgments against Hazeltine\u0027s parent corporation. The Supreme Court also held that damages were only proper with respect to the Canadian market because it was the only market in which Zenith had sustained injury. The Supreme Court reinstated the District Court\u0027s injunction against Hazeltine\u0027s conspiracy to restrict trade in foreign markets. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to determine whether Hazeltine conditioned the grant of its licenses on the payment of royalties for unpatented products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan concurred in part and dissented in part, objecting to the majority\u0027s apparent double standard that royalties provisions that measure royalties by a percentage of the licensees sales is lawful if included for the convenience of both parties, but unlawful if insisted on by the patentee.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":17528,"title":"Oral Argument - November 10, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/17528"}],"citation":{"volume":"401","page":"321","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26921"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

In 81, Clarence Williams was arrested in his house in 1967. Police searched the house for an hour and 45 minutes, discovering heroin on a shelf in a bedroom. The heroin was admitted at trial and Williams was convicted of concealing illegally imported heroin. Williams appealed, arguing that the search of his house was illegal under Chimel v. California, a case decided on June 23, 1969 that narrowed the permissible scope of searches incidental to an arrest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that Chimel did not apply retroactively, and the search was valid under pre-Chimel standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 82, Joseph Elkanich was convicted on three counts of selling narcotics in 1962. At trial, evidence included marked bills planted by a federal narcotics agent. The bills were seized during a search of Elkanich’s apartment after his arrest. The arrest and search were upheld at trial and on appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. Elkanich then unsuccessfully applied for post-conviction relief in the district court. While the appeal of that decision was pending, \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Chimel\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; was decided. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Chimel v. California apply retroactively to arrests and searches that occurred before June 23, 1969?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Though not agreeing on an opinion, six members of the Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit in both cases. Justice Byron R. White delivered the judgment of the Court, holding that Chimel did not apply retroactively whether a conviction is challenged on direct review, as in 81, or in collateral proceedings, as in 82. Justice Potter Stewart concurred, writing that he would affirm 82 because the question presented was not permitted in post-conviction relief proceedings. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. concurred in the result, agreeing that Chimel did not apply to searches conducted before June 23, 1969 following the three-factor analysis from Stoval v. Denno. Justice Hugo L. Black, concurred in the result, stating that Chimel was wrongly decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John. M. Harlan concurred in part and dissented in part, writing that he would affirm the conviction on 82, but would reverse on 81 because Chimel could apply retroactively to a direct review. Justice Thurgood Marshall also concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice William O. Douglas did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27034,"name":"Henry J.

The district court held the abortion statute was unconstitutionally vague.  The United States appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the United States Supreme Court have jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act to determine if the District of Columbia’s abortion statute is unconstitutionally vague? \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Is a statute that prohibits abortion unless necessary for the preservation for the mother’s life or health unconstitutionally vague?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no. Justice Hugo L. Black delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to determine if the District of Columbia’s abortion statute is unconstitutionally vague because, although the law only applies to the District of Columbia, the law was enacted by both Houses of Congress and signed into law by the President. The Court also held that the word “health” in the statute refers to the state of being in body or mind and includes psychological wellbeing; therefore, the abortion law is not unconstitutionally vague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he argued that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the case. However the statute leaves the physician too much discretion to determine what is necessary for the preservation for the mother’s health. Justice John M. Harlan wrote a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in par in which he argued that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction over this case because the statute only applies to the District of Columbia. Justice William J. Brennan Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the partial concurrence and partial dissent. In his separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Potter Stewart agreed that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction but argued that the physicians who performed abortions should be wholly immune from being charged with criminal offenses under this law if they performed abortions in order to preserve the mother’s life or health.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41969,"name":"Sanford Jay Rosen","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sanford_jay_rosen","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rosen","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"sanford_jay_rosen"},"advocate_description":"for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21524"},{"advocate":{"ID":42110,"name":"Stephen Marc Slepin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/stephen_marc_slepin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Slepin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"stephen_marc_slepin"},"advocate_description":"for the appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21525"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15914,"title":"Oral Argument - January 12, 1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15914"}],"citation":{"volume":"402","page":"62","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26927"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15073,"name":"Warren E.

The Pennsylvania statute was passed in 1968 and provided funding for non-public elementary and secondary school teachers’ salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials for secular subjects. Rhode Island’s statute was passed in 1969 and provided state financial support for non-public elementary schools in the form of supplementing 15% of teachers’ annual salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appellants in the Pennsylvania case represented citizens and taxpayers in Pennsylvania who believed that the statute violated the separation of church and state described in the First Amendment. Appellant Lemon also had a child in Pennsylvania public school. The district court granted the state officials’ motion to dismiss the case. In the Rhode Island case, the appellees were citizens and tax payers of Rhode Island who sued to have the statute in question declared unconstitutional by arguing that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The district court found in favor of the appellees and held that the statute violated the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo statutes that provide state funding for non-public, non-secular schools violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority as to the Pennsylvania statute and 8-1 as to the Rhode Island statute. The Court held that a statute must pass a three-pronged test in order to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. The statute must have a secular legislative purpose, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither promotes nor inhibits religion, and it must not foster “excessive government entanglement with religion.” The Court held that both the state statutes in question had secular legislative purposes because they reflected the desire of the states to ensure minimum secular education requirements were being met in the non-public schools. The Court did not reach a holding regarding the second prong of the test, but it did find that the statutes constituted an excessive government entanglement with religion. In the Rhode Island program, the amount of oversight of teachers and curricula required to ensure that there is no unnecessary injection of religion into secular topics would require the government to become excessively involved in the nuances of religious education. The same danger holds true for the Pennsylvania statute, which additionally provides state funding directly to a church-related organization. Government financial involvement in such institutions inevitably leads to “an intimate and continuing relationship” between church and state. The Court also noted the potential political implications of public funding, as there is a risk of religious issues becoming politically divisive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the intrusion of the government into the running of non-public schools through grants and other funding creates the entanglement that the Establishment Clause prohibits. He also argued that non-secular schools are so thoroughly governed by religious ideologies that any amount of public funding supports those doctrines, which the Framers of the Constitution dictated the government must not do. Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the concurrence, and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the parts relating to case numbers 569 and 570. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a separate concurrence in which he argued that the danger was not only that religion would infiltrate the government, but also that the government would push secularization onto religious creeds. An analysis of the statutes in question shows that they impermissible involve the government in “essentially religious activities,” which the Establishment Clause is meant to prevent. In his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Byron R. White wrote that the majority opinion goes too far and, in restricting the use of state funds in non-secular schools, creates an obstacle to the use of public funds for secular education. He argued that there was no proof that religion would invade secular education or that the government oversight of the use of public funds would be so extensive as to constitute entanglement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall did not participate in the discussion or decision of case number 89.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28029,"name":"Henry W.
