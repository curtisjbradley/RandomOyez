Lee, a middle school principal, invited a rabbi to speak at his school\u0027s graduation ceremony. Daniel Weisman\u0027s daughter, Deborah, was among the graduates. Hoping to stop the rabbi from speaking at his daughter\u0027s graduation, Weisman sought a temporary restaining order in District Court - but was denied. After the ceremony, where prayers were recited, Weisman filed for a permanent injunction barring Lee and other Providence public school officials from inviting clergy to deliver invocations and benedictions at their schools\u0027 ceremonies. When the Court of Appeals affirmed a District Court ruling against the schools, Lee appealed to the Supreme Court and was granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the inclusion of clergy who offer prayers at official public school ceremonies violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that government involvement in this case creates \"a state-sponsored and state-directed religious exercise in a public school.\" Such conduct conflicts with settled rules proscribing prayer for students. The school\u0027s rule creates subtle and indirect coercion (students must stand respectfully and silently), forcing students to act in ways which establish a state religion. The cornerstone principle of the Establishment Clause is that government may not compose official prayers to recite as part of a religious program carried on by government.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18687,"name":"Charles J.

The census is designed and carried out by the Secretary of Commerce before the results are forwarded to the President, who determines the number of Representatives each state will receive. In 1990, for only the second time since 1900, the census allocated employees of the Department of Defense who were stationed overseas to the states designated their \"homes of record.\" Massachusetts claimed that this adjustment of the census shifted one Representative from Massachusetts to Washington state. They brought suit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution, arguing that the allocation of overseas personnel to their \"homes of record\" was arbitrary and capricious under the APA standards and did not meet the constitutional requirement of counting the number of people \"in each State.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Secretary of Commerce\u0027s decision to apportion overseas personnel of the Department of Defense to their \"homes of record\" for census purposes meet the constitutional requirement of a census counting the number of people \"in each State,\" or was the procedure \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary\u0027s decision was not reviewable under the APA because it was not a \"final agency action.\" Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, in the majority opinion, wrote that only agency decisions that complete the decision-making process and directly affect the party bring suit may be challenged under the APA. In this case the Secretary\u0027s decision resulted merely in a set of findings reported to the President that he could ask to have revised using a different formula. Also, the recommendation (and therefore the procedure used to arrive at it) did not directly affect Massachusetts; the President had to take action before the findings would affect the number of Representatives apportioned to the State. The procedure and the findings that resulted from it, therefore, was not a \"final agency action\" challengeable under the APA, and the actions of the President are also not challengeable under the APA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvaluating the Secretary\u0027s chosen procedure under Article I Section 2 of the Constitution, however, Justice O\u0027Connor ruled that the decision to include overseas personnel of the Department of Defense was a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution\u0027s intent. \"The Secretary\u0027s judgment does not hamper the underlying constitutional goal of equal representation, but, assuming that employees temporarily stationed abroad have indeed retained their ties to their home states, actually promotes equality,\" wrote Justice O\u0027Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20921,"name":"Dwight Golann","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/dwight_golann","view_count":0,"last_name":"Golann","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"dwight_golann"},"advocate_description":"Argued the case for the appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15502"},{"advocate":{"ID":15086,"name":"John G.

Article XIIIA\u0027s \"acquisition value\" provision limited property assessment value increases to two percent, if caused by changes in ownership or new construction improvements. Article XIIIA exempted two types of transfers from this reassessment limit: first, if the principal seller is 55 or older and moved to a home of equal or lower value, and second, when a transfer occurred between parents and children. One of Article XIIIA\u0027s effects is that over time the taxes of new property owners, adjusted to reflect recent values, would be substantially higher than long-term property owner\u0027s taxes. A new property owner filed suit to challenge the state constitutional amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Article XIIIA\u0027s \"acquisition value provision,\" which created a dramatic disparity in the property taxes paid by long-term property owners as compared with new property owners, violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against new property owners?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court, through Justice Blackmun, held that California\u0027s new property tax system rationally and plausibly furthered legitimate state interests in restraining increasing property taxes and preserving local neighborhood stability. The discrepancy which Article XIIIA created between new and long time property owners is warranted, because the latter had a far greater reliance interest in their property than the former. Thus, long-time property owners deserved more protection from higher property taxes than new property owners. This demonstrated a significant difference between the two property owner types. In addition, both of Article XIIIA\u0027s exemptions rationally promoted a legitimate state interest. The first exemption did not discourage older people from moving to a smaller home that is likely to better suit their smaller family and income. The second exemption aimed at preserving family unity and neighborhood stability. Accordingly, the Court held that Article XIIIA did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19222,"name":"Carlyle W.

In the decree, the parties agreed single-occupancy cells would be provided for pretrial inmates. During the delay of the construction, the sheriff of Suffolk County moved to modify the decree to allow double bunking in certain cells to raise the jail’s occupancy. The sheriff argued that with the increasing number of pretrial detainees and a recent court decision, there was a change in fact and in law that was required to modify the decree. The district court refused the modification because the sheriff is required to show a grievous wrong by new and unforeseen circumstances to modify the decree and that the increase of pretrial detainees was neither new nor unforeseen. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the court require a grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen change of facts in order to modify a consented decree?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 6-2 majority. The Court held that the grievous wrong standard does not apply to requests to modify consent decrees and that changes of conduct or conditions may be revised if necessary for future events based on a flexible standard. Under a flexible standard, the party seeking modification of an institutional reform consent decree must establish that a significant change in facts or law warrants a revision of the decree and that the proposed modification is tailored to that change of circumstances. This requirement will be satisfied if the change was unforeseen or would be detrimental to public interests without the modification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens, with whom Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined, wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that after the institution was found by the district court to be deficient, it is the district court’s duty to command an effective remedy. In this case, the remedy was to have single-occupancy cells for pretrial detainees and it is important that the court apply a strict standard when considering modification request that undermines the central purpose of a consent decree. The modification of the consent decree should be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31738,"name":"John T.

The ADA was enacted to ensure that states would not undo the anticipated benefits of federal deregulation of the airline industry. In 1987, the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) adopted Air Travel Industry Enforcement Guidelines, which govern the content and format of airline advertising and award frequent flyers and payment to passengers who voluntarily gave up their seats on overbooked flights. The Attorney General of Texas sent letters to airlines, including Trans World Airlines, notifying them of the intent to sue if they did not follow the guidelines. Trans World Airlines sued and claimed that state regulation of fare advertisements is prohibited by the ADA. The district court found in favor of Trans World Airlines and held that states cannot take any enforcement action, which would restrict any aspect of the fare advertising or operations relating to rate, routes, or services. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 prevent states from prohibiting deceptive airline fare advertisements through enforcement of their general consumer protection statuses?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the 5-3 majority. The Court held that the ADA prevents the enforcement of the NAAG fare-advertising guidelines through a state’s general consumer protection. When the ADA was enacted, Congress intended to prevent the state enforcement action if it has a connection with, or references airline rates, routes, or services, including advertisements. The NAAG guidelines explicitly refer to the rates within the meaning of the ADA and would have a significant impact on the airline’s ability to market their product and upon the fares they charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued the words “relate to” in the ADA should not be given a broad meaning because it gives the ADA pre-emption provision a meaning beyond the words and the legislative history behind the enactment. Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined the dissent\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice David H.

Among the new provisions, the law required informed consent and a 24 hour waiting period prior to the procedure. A minor seeking an abortion required the consent of one parent (the law allows for a judicial bypass procedure). A married woman seeking an abortion had to indicate that she notified her husband of her intention to abort the fetus. These provisions were challenged by several abortion clinics and physicians. A federal appeals court upheld all the provisions except for the husband notification requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a state require women who want an abortion to obtain informed consent, wait 24 hours, if married, notify their husbands, and, if minors, obtain parental consent, without violating their right to abortion as guaranteed by Roe v. Wade?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a bitter 5-to-4 decision, the Court again reaffirmed Roe, but it upheld most of the Pennsylvania provisions. For the first time, the justices imposed a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The new standard asks whether a state abortion regulation has the purpose or effect of imposing an \"undue burden,\" which is defined as a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" Under this standard, the only provision to fail the undue-burden test was the husband notification requirement. In a rare step, the opinion for the Court was crafted and authored by three justices: O\u0027Connor, Kennedy, and Souter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearn more about the Supreme Court and abortion law in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://projects.oyez.org/body-politic\"\u003eBody Politic\u003c/a\u003e, a nonpartisan Oyez resource.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33884,"name":"Kathryn Kolbert","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/kathryn_kolbert","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kolbert","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"kathryn_kolbert"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15523"},{"advocate":{"ID":22936,"name":"Ernest D.

The state had operated legally segregated universities, but had since adopted race-neutral policies to dismantle its de jure segregated system. All students could choose which school to attend, though the choices produced nearly all white and all black institutions of higher learning. This case was decided together with that of Ayers v. Fordice.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eHas Mississippi met its affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause to dismantle its prior dual university system?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. A state\u0027s duty is not discharged \"until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continues to foster segregation.\" Race-neutral admissions are not a sufficient corrective to constitutional violations of a dual system. Different admissions criteria, and different missions for university system components, may have racially discriminatory effects perpetuating the old system. The Court did not declare the present system unconstitutional, only that Mississippi had not done enough to eliminate segregation. The Justices turned the matter back to state officials -- and to the courts -- to determine what must be done to fulfill its duty under the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15763,"name":"Alvin O.

The suits challenged five federal statutes.  In response, Congress enacted §318 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which required harvesting in certain areas, while prohibiting it in others.  §318 included the names of the lawsuits and specifically stated that it was enacted to address the challenges from the lawsuits.  Respondents argued that §318 violated Article III of the Constitution because it directed the results of the two pending cases, a job for the judiciary, not the legislature.  The district courts rejected that claim, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit consolidated the cases and reversed, holding that Congress was directing the result in pending cases without repealing or amending the underlying litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes § 318 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, violate Article III of the U.S. Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for a unanimous court, reversed the Ninth Circuit and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that §318 did not violate Article III because it made changes to the law by replacing the legal standards of the five challenged statutes.  It did not make any findings of law or fact, or compel any results in the pending cases.  The explicit reference to the cases only served to identify the statutes underlying those cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43372,"name":"Todd D.

Forty-five hours later, David Riggins was arrested and charged with the murder. A few days after being taken into custody, Riggins complained to Dr. R. Edward Quass, the psychiatrist who treated patients in jail, that he was hearing voices. Dr. Quass prescribed the antipsychotic drug Mellaril and, when the voices did not stop, gradually increased the dosage. In January of 1988, Riggins successfully moved for determination of his competence to stand trial, and he was found to be competent. As the trial moved forward, Riggins moved to suspend his treatment with Mellaril because he planned to offer an insanity defense at trial and asserted that he had the right to show the jury his true mental state. The district court denied Riggins motion. Riggins was found guilty and sentenced to death. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs during trial violate the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Supreme Court held that an individual has the right to freedom from an unwanted antipsychotic drug. In order for the state to administer an antipsychotic drug against the patient’s wishes, the state must establish the pressing need for the administration of the drug. Because the district court did not reach a finding on the necessity of the Mellaril, the Court held that its administration was an error that infringed on Riggins’ constitutional rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s concurring opinion, he wrote that the Due Process Clause prohibits the state from administering unwanted psychotic drugs to a defendant in order to make the defendant competent to stand trial. He argued that, since the administration of the antipsychotic drug can significantly alter the demeanor of the defendant during the trial and on the stand, it can amount to a manipulation of evidence by the state. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent where he argued that the issue of whether or not the state should have issued the antipsychotic medication without Riggins’ consent is a separate legal issue from his trial. He argued that there was no evidence that the Mellaril rendered Riggins’ trial anything less than “full and fair,” and therefore Riggins was not entitled to have his conviction reversed. Because he was found to be competent to stand trial under the influence of Mellaril, the Mellaril could not have significantly interfered with his ability to take part in his own defense. Justice Thomas also argued that, since Riggins approached the jail psychiatrist for medication because he was hearing voices, the district court did not order Riggins to take the Mellaril. Justice Antonin Scalia joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33236,"name":"James Tufteland","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/james_tufteland","view_count":0,"last_name":"Tufteland","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"james_tufteland"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15569"},{"advocate":{"ID":36963,"name":"Mace J.

Two Pesos, another similar restaurant chain based in Houston, Texas, opened a few years later with a remarkably similar look.  Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act.  Two Pesos allegedly copied Taco Cabana’s distinctive trade dress.  The judge instructed the jury that trade dress must be inherently distinctive of have acquired a secondary meaning.  The jury found that Taco Cabana’s trade dress was inherently distinctive, but had not acquired a secondary meaning.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  The court rejected Two Pesos argument that a finding of no secondary meaning necessarily means the trade dress is not inherently distinctive and is not protected under the Lanham Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs proof of a secondary meaning required to show that trade dress is inherently distinctive and protected by the Lanham Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision.  The Supreme Court held that trade dress can be protected under the Lanham Act based on inherent distinctiveness even if there is no proof of a secondary meaning.  Recovery is usually available for trademark infringement without a secondary meaning, and there is no persuasive reason for treating trade dress differently from other types of trademark.  Requiring a secondary meaning would go against the purposes of the Lanham Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia concurred, stating that the Lanham Act and its common law counterpart were broad enough to cover trade dress.  Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the judgment, expressing that the majority’s decision was supported by stare decisis.  Justice Clarence Thomas also concurred in the judgment, arguing that the common law roots of the Lanham Act justify this decision better than the majority’s reasoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33792,"name":"Kimball J.

The state court ruled in favor of Quill, grounding its decision on \u003cem\u003eBellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Illinois, 386 U.S. 753\u003c/em\u003e. In this 1967 case, the United States Supreme Court found a similar Illinois statute to be in violation of both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The North Dakota Supreme Court reversed, basing its decision on a rejection of \u003cem\u003eBellas Hess\u003c/em\u003e in light of the \"tremendous social, economic, commercial, and legal innovations\" since it had been decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1) Had \u003cem\u003eBellas Hess\u003c/em\u003e become obsolete? 2) Was North Dakota\u0027s imposition of a use tax upon the merchandise of the Quill Corporation in compliance with the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and No. In a majority opinion authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court admitted that, over time, subsequent cases have allowed for more flexibility than \u003cem\u003eBellas Hess\u003c/em\u003e. Nevertheless, the Court maintained that this evolution does not suggest a rejection of \u003cem\u003eBellas Hess\u003c/em\u003e. The Court also determined that North Dakota\u0027s imposition of the use tax did not constitute a breach of the Due Process Clause because the Quill Corporation had sufficient contact with the state\u0027s residents and benefited from the state\u0027s tax revenue. However, it found the use tax to be unconstitutional because it interfered with interstate commerce, rendering it a violation of the Commerce Clause. Consequently, the Court reversed the North Dakota Supreme Court\u0027s decision by ruling in favor of the Quill Corporation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30651,"name":"John E.

In 1987, Etowah County Commission passed the \"Common Fund Resolution\", combining all of the commission\u0027s funds into one county-wide budget and eliminating each commissioner\u0027s power over the distribution of funds allocated for his or her own road district. Newly elected black member, Commissioner Lawrence C. Presley, claimed that the changes in the distribution of authority were a form of racial discrimination and a violation of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which permits a state government to alter practices related to voting only after receiving judicial preclearance. The Etowah County Commission had not received this preclearance, and neither had the Russell County Commission when, in 1979, its members instituted the \"Unit System.\" This system transferred full authority over Russell County roads, highways, bridges, and ferries from the commissioners to the appointed county engineer. When the first 2 black commissioners were elected in Russell County, they joined Presley in filing a suit against Etowah and Russell Counties in the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The District Court determined that preclearance was unnecessary in both 2 instances, but Presley appealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the alterations imposed by the Etowah County Commission and the Russell County Commission regarding the scope of commissioner authority constitute changes \"with respect to voting\" according to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a majority opinion authored by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court determined that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act covers only changes that directly relate to voting. More specifically, the Court found that case law outlines 4 areas in which alterations require preclearance under section 5: the method of voting, the requirements for candidacy, the composition of the electorate, and the formation or elimination of an elected office. In the Court\u0027s opinion, neither the \"Common Fund Resolution\" nor the \"Unit System\" fell in any of the 4 categories. Instead, those 2 changes merely concern the \"internal operation of an elected body\". Thus, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23085,"name":"Edward Still","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/edward_still","view_count":0,"last_name":"Still","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"edward_still"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15615"},{"advocate":{"ID":39797,"name":"Robert A.

Section 562(d) of the act also states that Amtrak may buy tracks from private railroads, and may ask the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to condemn tracks owned by those railroads if they cannot agree on sale terms, provided that the tracks in question are \"required for intercity rail passenger service.\" Amtrak\u0027s need for the tracks is established unless the private railroad can show either that its ability to carry out its obligations as a common carrier (that is, a transporter of public goods) will be seriously hampered or that Amtrak\u0027s needs can be met by the purchase of alternative property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmtrak had a \"trackage rights\" agreement with Boston and Maine Railroad (B \u0026amp; M). Amtrak claimed that it was forced to discontinue this agreement because B \u0026amp; M did not properly maintain its tracks. Amtrak then entered into an agreement with the Central Vermont Railroad (CV), under which it would acquire the B \u0026amp; M track and sell it to CV, which would take over maintenance of the track but grant \"trackage rights\" to Amtrak and usage rights to B \u0026amp; M. When B \u0026amp; M declined Amtrak\u0027s offer to purchase the track, Amtrak asked the ICC to condemn the track (thus allowing Amtrak to seize it). The ICC granted Amtrak\u0027s request. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, sent the case back to the ICC for reconsideration, because Amtrak had not demonstrated the need for ownership, just for use (demonstrated by its intent to convey the property to CV). Amtrak petitioned the appeals court to rehear the case, and while the petition was pending Congress amended the RPSA to explicitly allow Amtrak to seize property with the ICC\u0027s permission and then convey it to another party if that would further its mission. The appeals court denied rehearing, however, holding that the condemnation had been invalid because it was not \"required for intercity rail passenger service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the Interstate Commerce Commission\u0027s decision to permit Amtrak to seize the property of B \u0026amp; M Railroad under the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 reasonable?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that the ICC was entitled to deference and that its decision had been reasonable. In the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that by interpreting the statute\u0027s use of \"required\" to mean that the track must be useful but not absolutely indispensable to Amtrak\u0027s operation, the ICC had better accommodated the underlying intention of the RPSA than the appeals court. That finding was reinforced by Congress\u0027s amendment to the act, which would only be effective under the ICC\u0027s interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28555,"name":"Irwin Goldbloom","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/irwin_goldbloom","view_count":0,"last_name":"Goldbloom","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"irwin_goldbloom"},"advocate_description":"Argued the case for the respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15626"},{"advocate":{"ID":15086,"name":"John G.

Before the criminal trial, the prosecution moved to bar the defense from using its peremptory challenges to eliminate black people from the juror pool. The term \"preemptory challenge\" refers to the right to reject a potential juror during jury selection without giving a reason. The trial judge denied the prosecution\u0027s motion, and, when the prosecution appealed, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the trial judge\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibit a criminal defendant\u0027s use of peremptory challenges to discriminate against potential jurors on the basis of race?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a majority opinion authored by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court found that the exercise of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner not only violates the rights of potential jurors, but also undermines the integrity of the judicial system. Since the Court also determined that a peremptory challenge did constitute state action, it found the use of peremptory challenge for the purpose of racial discrimination to be a breach of the Equal Protection Clause. Consequently, the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court was reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27445,"name":"Harrison W.

In order to be approved, the plan must be \"in effect in all\" a state\u0027s political subdivisions and \"be mandatory upon them,\" and must state that \"reasonable efforts will be made\" to prevent removal of children from their homes and to facilitate reunification of families where removal has occurred. Several children in the Illinois foster care program brought suit against the Director and the Guardianship Administrator of the Illinois program under 42 U.S.C. 1983, which provides private individuals a right to sue for \"deprivation of any rights ... secured by [federal] laws.\" They charged that Illinois had failed to make reasonable efforts to preserve and reunite families, and that it was required to do so by the AACW. The Director and Guardianship Administrator argued that the children had no standing to sue because the AACW did not create substantive rights that had to be reinforced, but merely stated what contents an administrative plan needed to have in order to receive approval. The federal District Court sided with the children, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 create a \"right\" for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. 1983, allowing children affected by a state\u0027s adoption program to bring a private suit against its administrators?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 7-to-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 only required that a state have a plan for the administration of adoption and foster care programs in order to receive federal reimbursement, not that the plan be correctly carried out. The language of the statute requiring that the plan be \"in effect in all\" political subdivisions of the state meant only that the plan had to apply to all of them, not that they were actually required to carry it out. The Secretary of Health and Human Services could reasonably withhold approval of a plan if it was clear that the plan would not be applied, but nothing in the Act suggested that Congress had intended to create a private right to sue for the enforcement of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20189,"name":"Christina M.

And, the trial court, not the attorneys, performed \u003cem\u003evoir dire\u003c/em\u003e, which involves questioning potential jurors during jury selection to determine their ability to be impartial. Before Derrick Morgan\u0027s capital murder trial, he requested that the court ask the potential jurors whether they would automatically sentence him to the death penalty upon conviction. The trial court denied Morgan\u0027s request, and he was convicted and sentenced to death. When he appealed, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u0027s decision, Morgan\u0027s conviction, and his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment\u0027s impartial jury requirement bar a state from refusing to ask whether a potential juror would automatically vote to impose the death penalty upon a defendant convicted of a capital offense?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a majority opinion authored by Justice Byron R. White, the Court noted that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the impartial jury requirement of the Sixth Amendment, in combination, indicate that the criminally accused have a right to an impartial jury. It found that a juror who would automatically vote for the death penalty in criminal sentencing would be prejudiced. The Court also concluded that, in order to detect this prejudice, an adequate \u003cem\u003evoir dire\u003c/em\u003e is necessary. Therefore, an adequate \u003cem\u003evoir dire\u003c/em\u003e would include a question to determine whether a juror would automatically vote for the death penalty, upon request. Thus, the decision of the Illinois State Supreme Court was reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33837,"name":"Kenneth L.

Hudson sued the guards in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. 1983, which allows individuals to bring suit for the \"deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.\" Hudson argued that they had violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The District Court ruled that the guards had used force when there was no need to do so, violating the Eighth Amendment, and that Hudson was therefore entitled to damages. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, however, finding that an inmate must demonstrate \"significant injury\" when he claims that his Eighth Amendment rights have been violated by the use of excessive force.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust an inmate alleging that his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment has been violated by the excessive use of force demonstrate \"significant injury\" to prevail on his claim?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that the degree of injury suffered by an inmate is one of several important factors in an Eighth Amendment claim of cruel and unusual punishment, but that the absence of \"significant injury\" alone does not mean his rights have not been violated. Instead, the Court should consider whether the punishment inflicted was malicious and sadistic. \"When prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decency are always violated,\" Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor wrote in the majority opinion. \"This is true whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury. Such a result would have been as unacceptable to the drafters of the Eighth Amendment as it is today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15610,"name":"Alvin J.

The clinics claimed that the protesters had violated 42 U.S.C. 1985(3), which prohibits conspiracies to deprive \"any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.\" The protesters had sought to deny women their \"right to abortion\" and their right to interstate travel, the clinics argued. The District Court agreed, holding that Bray and others, by blocking access to the clinics, had conspired to deprive women seeking abortions of their right to interstate travel. The District Court also ruled for the clinics on state law trespassing and public nuisance claims, ordering the protesters to stop trespassing on or obstructing access to clinics. Finally, the District Court ordered the protesters to pay the clinics\u0027 attorney\u0027s fees and costs on the 1985(3) claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid anti-abortion protesters who obstructed access to Washington, D.C. abortion clinics violate 42 U.S.C. 1985(3) by conspiring to deny women their \"right to abortion\" or right to interstate travel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the protesters had not violated section 1985(3) by obstructing access to the abortion clinics. Justice Antonin Scalia, in the majority opinion, wrote that under the Court\u0027s decision in \u003cem\u003eGriffin v. Breckenridge\u003c/em\u003e, 403 U.S. 88, there must be a \"class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus [underlying] the conspirators\u0027 action\" for it to violate 1985(3). The clinics\u0027 claim that the protesters had demonstrated \"animus\" toward women as a class was unfounded because the demonstrations were not directed at women but rather were intended to protect the victims of abortion, stop its practice, and reverse its legalization. Opposition to abortion cannot reasonably be presumed to reflect gender-based intent, Justice Scalia wrote, because there are common and respectable reasons for opposing abortion other than a derogatory view of women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to holding that the protesters did not exercise discriminatory animus, Scalia also addressed the specific rights on which the clinics based their arguments. The right to interstate travel, Scalia pointed out, was not affected here because the protests were carried out entirely within the District of Columbia and were not aimed specifically at interstate travelers. Nor was the \"right to abortion\" implicated, he wrote, because that right was merely one to be free of governmental interference in the decision. The protesters, acting as private individuals, could not possibly violate that right.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33043,"name":"Jay Alan Sekulow","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jay_alan_sekulow","view_count":0,"last_name":"Sekulow","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jay_alan_sekulow"},"advocate_description":"Argued and reargued the case for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15651"},{"advocate":{"ID":32923,"name":"John H.

In 1985, government agencies began investigating Jacobson\u0027s interest in child pornography. Over the course of about 2 ½ years, they sent him mailings from 5 fictitious organizations and one non-existent pen pal all promoting sexual liberation and challenging government censorship. After Jacobson was somewhat responsive, a government agency attempted to sting him by selling him child pornography which he purchased, resulting in his arrest and conviction. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the prosecution against Jacobson prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that agencies of the United States Government did not incite his violation of the Child Protection Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a majority decision authored by Justice Byron R. White, the Court determined that, the prosecution was unable to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Jacobson was inclined to commit the criminal act of purchasing child pornography independent of government interference. Doubt stems from the fact that government agencies may have actually encouraged Jacobson to break the law in their effort to prosecute him. Since the Court found that the prosecution failed, the decision of the Court of Appeals and Jacobson\u0027s conviction were reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25717,"name":"George H.

When Argentina could not cover the FEIC contracts, it issued \"Bonods,\" which provided for repayment in U.S. dollars through transfer on the market in one of several locations. Subsequently, when Argentina concluded that it lacked sufficient foreign exchange to retire the Bonods, it unilaterally extended the time for payment and offered bondholders substitute instruments as a means of rescheduling the debts. Ultimately, two Panamanian corporations and a Swiss bank brought a breach-of-contract action in Federal District Court. The court denied Argentina\u0027s motion to dismiss. In affirming, the Court of Appeals ruled that the District Court had jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), which subjects foreign states to suit in American courts for acts taken \"in connection with a commercial activity\" that have \"a direct effect in the United States.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the Republic of Argentina\u0027s default on certain bonds an act taken \"in connection with a commercial activity\" that had a \"direct effect in the United States\" so as to subject Argentina to suit in an American court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that the District Court properly asserted jurisdiction under the FSIA. The Court reasoned that the issuance of the Bonods was a \"commercial activity\" and that the rescheduling of the maturity dates on those instruments was taken \"in connection with\" that activity because Argentina had acted as a private player within a market and not as a regulator of that market. Moreover, the Court concluded that the unilateral rescheduling of the Bonods had a \"direct effect in the United States\" because Argentina had designated their accounts in New York as the place of payment and had made some interest payments into those accounts before announcing that it was rescheduling the payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39032,"name":"Richard W.

White’s trial on charges related to a sexual assault of a 4-year-old girl, Illinois state prosecutors twice-attempted to call the child, who was by then five years old, as a witness, but each time she experienced emotional difficulty and left the stand without testifying. The trial court then allowed the admission of testimony by the girl’s babysitter, mother, emergency room nurse, doctor and an investigating officer that recounted statements she made describing the crime. This testimony was allowed into evidence under state-law hearsay exceptions for spontaneous declarations and statements made in the course of a medical examination. The jury subsequently convicted White. On appeal, the Illinois Appellate Court rejected White’s claims that the introduction of the out-of-court statements violated his right to confront and cross-examine witnesses under the Sixth Amendment and affirmed the conviction. The Illinois Supreme Court denied discretionary review of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment require either that the prosecution produce a declarant at trial or show that the declarant is unavailable before admitting his or her out-of-court statements under the “spontaneous declaration” and “medical examination” exceptions to the hearsay rule?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that the Confrontation Clause does not require that a declarant be produced at trial or found unavailable before his out-of-court statements may be admitted into evidence. Instead, when the statements fall within a “firmly-rooted” exception to the hearsay rule, they satisfy the Confrontation Clause. Statements made in certain contexts carry special guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness, such as when the prospect of misdiagnosis or mistreatment deters a declarant from making false statements while obtaining medical treatment. Consequently, the Court held that cross-examination does not aid the truth-finding process with respect to these types of statements as much as it might for out-of-court statements that do not come under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in part and concurring the judgment in which he urged that the Confrontation Clause be applied more narrowly and only to extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, or confessions. According to Justice Thomas, the Court’s interpretation of the Confrontation Clause as permitting out-of-court statements that fall within a “firmly-established” hearsay exception does not comport with the text of the Sixth Amendment or with the history of extending cross-examination rights to defendants. Justice Antonin Scalia joined in the opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41813,"name":"Stephen L.

Section 2, conferred original jurisdiction on the federal district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the \"sue and be sued\" provision in the Red Cross\u0027 charter confer original jurisdiction on federal courts over all cases to which the Red Cross is a party?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. A congressional charter\u0027s \"sue and be sued\" provision confers federal-court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts. The Red Cross Charter provision does specifically mention the federal courts. This holding leaves the jurisdiction of the federal courts well within the Article III limits, because the Court has consistently held that Article III\u0027s \"arising under\" jurisdiction is broad enough to authorize Congress to confer federal-court jurisdiction over actions involving federally chartered corporations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39134,"name":"Roy T.

However, in 1986, DCSS officials filed a motion, intending for the District Court to declare the DCSS officially desegregated and withdraw supervision. \u003cem\u003eGreen v. School Board of New Kent County\u003c/em\u003e, outlines 6 categories in which a school district should achieve desegregation, and the District Court found that the DCSS was successful in 4 of these categories. Consequently, the court decided to relinquish control over the DCSS in these 4 areas, while it maintained control and mandated further improvements in the areas in which segregation still existed. Both the respondents, black schoolchildren and their parents, and the petitioners, the DCSS officials, appealed the District Court\u0027s decision, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed it. The Court of Appeals argued that the District Court should have authority over the DCSS until it is fully desegregated in all 6 categories for several years.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1) Is a district court permitted to withdraw supervision of a school system that is under a court-ordered desegregation decree in the areas in which the school system complies with its decree if it does not comply in every area? 2) In the case of the DCSS, was the Court of Appeals correct in reversing the District Court\u0027s decision to withdraw supervision incrementally?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and No. In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court found that a district court must only maintain control over a school system in the categories in which it has failed to abide by its court-ordered desegregation plan. The Court argued that this incremental approach provides district courts with a systematic and orderly means to their ultimate goal: to fully withdraw supervision. In addition, it allows the district court to focus more attention and resources where they are needed most. In compliance with the Court\u0027s determination, it reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39761,"name":"Rex E.

On April 18, 1992, three days before his scheduled execution date, Harris and other death-row inmates filed a civil rights class action lawsuit in federal district court. The complaint alleged that execution by lethal gas constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Just hours before Harris was scheduled to be executed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an order to stay the execution, and the state appealed the stay to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the order staying Harris’ execution be vacated?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam opinion, the Court vacated the stay of execution because Harris’s decision to wait so long to raise his cruel and unusual punishment claim represented an “obvious attempt” to manipulate the judicial process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent in which he argued that the lower court should hear and rule on Harris’s claim that execution by cyanide gas inflicts extreme and unnecessary pain. Because the state’s authority to impose a punishment depends entirely on its constitutionality, Harris’ delay in raising the claim was immaterial in Justice Stevens’ view. Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"503","page":"653","year":"1992","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/17979"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15071,"name":"Byron R.

The law allowed the administrator to adjust the fee to correspond with the estimated cost of maintaining public order during the activity. In January 1989, The Nationalist Movement (Movement) applied for a permit to hold a rally on the courthouse steps in Cumming, Georgia, to protest the federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. The county charged $100 for the permit, but that amount that did not include a calculation for expected law enforcement expenses during the rally. The Movement did not pay the fee and did not hold the rally; instead the Movement sued the county in federal district court and challenged its authority to interfere with the Movement’s free speech and assembly rights. The district court found that the county administrator did not unconstitutionally apply the ordinance to the Movement’s permit application because the fee was based solely on content-neutral criteria such as the costs of processing the application. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and held that the permit fee of up to $1,000 a day exceeded the constitutional requirement that governments charge only a nominal fee for using public forums.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an ordinance that permits a government administrator to vary the fee for assembling or parading to reflect the estimated cost of maintaining public order violate the free speech guarantees under the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the ordinance violated the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it contained no reasonable or definite standards to guide the county administrator’s calculation of permit fees. Additionally, the ordinance required the administrator to examine the speech’s content to assess the likelihood of public hostility to the message and adjust the fee accordingly to account for security and law enforcement costs. In the Court’s view, a nominal fee lower than $1000 could not save the ordinance from the constitutional infirmities it found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissent in which he disagreed with the argument that the Constitution limits a parade license fee to a nominal amount and argued that the Court should have remanded the case to determine the scope of the ordinance and how it was administered. Justice Byron R.

Franklin reported the harassment to teachers and school district administrators, but the administration did nothing.  They also encouraged Franklin to refrain from pressing charges.  Hill resigned in 1988 on the condition that all matters pending against him were dropped.  After Hill’s resignation the school closed its investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFranklin brought this action against the school district under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for failing to take action against Hill.   The district court dismissed the suit, holding that Title IX did not authorize an award for damages.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Title IX allow recovery of monetary damages?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Byron R. White wrote the Court\u0027s unanimous decision, holding that monetary damages are available under Title IX because there is a presumption that any appropriate relief is available to remedy the violation of a federal right. In this case, back pay and prospective relief were not sufficient remedies.  Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a special concurrence, stating that when causes of action are judicially implied, it is proper to imply limitations on the remedies for those actions as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31305,"name":"Joel I.

When Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents went to his home to arrest him, they found he had left for Colombia four days earlier.  The DEA later found out that Doggett was in custody in Panama on unrelated charges.  While the Panamanian government promised to expel Doggett back to the United States after the proceedings in Panama were over, Doggett was allowed to continue on to Colombia.  The DEA agent in charge did not follow up on the case and Doggett reentered the United States without issue in 1982 where he lived openly under his own name and in accordance with the law.  No one looked into Doggett’s whereabouts, but in 1988 a random credit check of individuals with outstanding warrants revealed his place of residence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being arrested, Doggett moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the government’s failure to prosecute him earlier violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.  A federal magistrate found that the length of time between indictment and arrest was presumptively prejudicial, but recommended dismissal of Doggett’s motion because he did not show actual prejudice.  The district court followed the magistrate’s recommendation.  Doggett then entered a conditional guilty plea, allowing him to appeal the subsequent conviction on the speedy trial claim.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould a mandatory requirement of actual prejudice be imposed in order for the accused to prevail on a claim that his right to a speedy trial has been violated?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHas \u003ci\u003eMoore v. Arizona\u003c/i\u003e, which holds that an affirmative demonstration of prejudice is not required, been reversed?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No.  Justice David H. Souter, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that the government’s egregious failure to locate and prosecute Doggett warranted relief even without showing actual prejudice.  Doggett was unaware of the indictment prior to be arrested 8 ½ years later, so he could not be penalized for failing to raise the speedy trial defense earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor dissented, arguing that the possibility of prejudice is not enough to prove that the right to a speedy trial has been violated.  Justice Clarence Thomas also dissented, arguing that the right to a speedy trial was meant to prevent oppressive incarceration and the anxiety accompanying public accusation.  Because Doggett was never incarcerated and had no knowledge of the charges against him until his arrest, neither of those purposes were served by this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":46262,"name":"William J.
