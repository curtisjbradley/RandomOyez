After pleading guilty to pool selling, a misdemeanor, he was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $500, but the sentence was suspended after 90 days and Malloy was placed on two years probation. Some 16 months following his plea, a Superior Court appointed referee ordered Malloy to testify about gambling and other criminal activities in Hartford County. When Malloy refused, \"on grounds it may tend to incriminate [him]\" he was imprisoned for contempt and held until willing to answer questions. Malloy filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his confinement. On appeal from the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors ruling, upholding an adverse Superior Court denial, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourteenth Amendment protect a state witness\u0027s Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination in a criminal proceeding?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 opinion, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment\u0027s exception from compulsory self-incrimination is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgement by a state. When determining if state officers properly obtained a confession, one must focus on whether the statements were made freely and voluntarily without any direct or implied promised or improper influence. Noting that the American judicial system is accusatorial, not inquisitorial, the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment secures defendants against self-incrimination and compels state and federal officials to establish guilt by evidence that is free and independent of a suspect\u0027s or witnesses\u0027 statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14466,"title":"Oral Argument - March 05, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14466"}],"citation":{"volume":"378","page":"1","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25394"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

They refused to leave when requested to do so by the hostess on behalf of Mr. Hooper, the president of the corporation that owned the restaurant. Mr. Hooper called the police, who told him that they needed a warrant to be able to do anything. After Mr. Hooper swore out a warrant, the students were arrested for violating a Maryland statute prohibiting trespassing. The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the students\u0027 convictions be upheld in the light of intervening state laws?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that, since the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions on January 9, 1962, Maryland had passed state and local laws that criminalized the conduct of Hooper\u0027s restaurant employees in refusing to serve the students because of their race. Under these statutes, the students\u0027 actions would not be illegal and their right to obtain service in the restaurant would be protected. The Court held that these laws supervened in this case because, although the convictions were affirmed in the Maryland Court of Appeals, the judgment was still not final as the case was before the Supreme Court. The Court reversed the ruling and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the new laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that the majority opinion should have reversed the judgment and directed the dismissal of the indictment. He wrote that the case should be decided on the merits and argued that policies allowing people to be refused service based on their race creates a second class of citizens, which the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments were enacted to prevent. Justice Arthur J. Goldberg partially joined in the concurrence. In his separate concurrence, Justice Goldberg wrote that the Constitution guarantees all Americans the right to be treated equally with respect to public accommodations. He argued that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments have the express purpose of preventing any group from being treated as second-class citizens due to their race. Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Douglas joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent the application of a state\u0027s trespass laws in this case. He wrote that the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit a state from prosecuting crimes against a person or person\u0027s property, as in the case of a trespass. Because the Fourteenth Amendment does not compel a private business owner to trade with anyone against his will, it does not prohibit a business owner from establishing rules regarding which customers he will or will not serve. Justice John M. Harlan and Justice Byron R. White joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30616,"name":"Jack Greenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_greenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_greenberg"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21550"},{"advocate":{"ID":34610,"name":"Loring E.

The corporation loaded the sugar on to the S.S. Hornfels, but in response to President Eisenhower reducing the Cuban sugar quota, Cuba issued a decree taking possession of the sugar.  The Cuban government would only allow the sugar to leave Cuba if Farr, Whitlock entered into a new contract with Banco Nacional de Cuba, an instrumentality of the Cuban government.  After the sugar left Cuba, Farr, Whitlock refused to pay Banco Nacional.  Banco Nacional sued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover payment.  The court granted summary judgment for Far, Whitlock, holding that Cuba’s taking of the sugar violated international law.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay the courts of the United States refuse to give effect to decrees of a foreign sovereign government where the decree violates common international law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In an 8-1 decision, Justice John M. Harlan wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that it will not decide the validity of a decree by a foreign government absent a treaty or other agreement.  It did not matter that the taking violated customary international law.  The majority noted that a judicial decision on this issue without a treaty would strain U.S.-Cuba relations.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, stating that he would decide the case on the merits, absent any specific objection to examining Cuba’s law under international law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43662,"name":"Victor Rabinowitz","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/victor_rabinowitz","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rabinowitz","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"victor_rabinowitz"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21967"},{"advocate":{"ID":20299,"name":"C.

Patterson, filed suit against the NAACP, a New York corporation advocating for equal rights for black Americans. He filed the action as an attempt to oust the association from the state. The claim alleged that the NAACP failed to comply with Alabama statutes requiring foreign corporations to register with the Alabama Secretary of State, along with other acts more clearly related to the NAACP’s political mission. That same day, the Attorney General obtained a restraining order barring the NAACP from conducting business in the state or attempting to comply with the statutory requirements in question. Before the case was heard on the merits, the court found the NAACP to be in contempt, in part for failing to comply with a court order requiring the NAACP to produce records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court of Alabama dismissed the NAACP’s petition for a writ of certiorari. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States held that requiring the NAACP to produce records including names and addresses of its members was a violation of those members’ freedom of association. The Supreme Court of Alabama, however, again affirmed the judgment of contempt, arguing that the Supreme Court’s judgment rested on the mistaken premise that Alabama had incorrectly interpreted its own procedural rules. The Supreme Court of the United States again remanded the case in a per curiam opinion, holding that the NAACP had satisfied the district court’s order even though the NAACP did not produce the membership lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NAACP then filed an action in federal court, alleging that the Alabama courts were depriving the organization of its constitutional rights and seeking to enjoin enforcement of the trial court’s restraining order. The district court dismissed the action, but the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded to the district court, instructing the district court to retain jurisdiction only if Alabama state courts did not promptly try the NAACP’s case. The Supreme Court of the United States then ordered the district court to try the NAACP’s case unless the State of Alabama gave the NAACP a hearing before January 2, 1962. In December 1961, an Alabama circuit court decreed that the NAACP continued its activities in Alabama in violation of the laws and constitution of Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWas the NAACP properly barred from obtaining a hearing in Alabama courts because its brief did not conform to the rules of the Supreme Court of Alabama?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWas this a state question barring federal review?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid Alabama properly enjoin the NAACP from acting in Alabama because the NAACP failed to comply with statutory requirements for foreign corporations?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid Alabama properly enjoin the NAACP from acting in Alabama because its political activities violated Alabama law?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion written by Justice John Harlan, the Court held that the form of the NAACP’s brief should not prevent it from obtaining a hearing in Alabama courts. Justice Harlan first determined whether the form of the NAACP\u0027s brief was a state question barring federal review. He noted that the Court had already ruled that most of the formal requirements deprived the NAACP of its federal constitutional rights. Justice Harlan cited the Court’s prior reasoning on the NAACP’s claim, confirming that novelty in state procedural requirements cannot prevent parties from seeking to vindicate their federal constitutional rights in state courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan also held that Alabama improperly applied the state registration requirements. He looked to the language of the statute, noting that the stated penalty for failure to comply was a forfeiture of one thousand dollars for each offense; there was no mention of permanent ouster in the statutory language. Justice Harlan determined that the purpose of the requirements was simply to ensure that foreign corporations would be amenable to suit in Alabama, and confirmed this interpretation through a brief overview of Alabama case law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to Alabama’s other allegations, Justice Harlan held that the vast majority of the NAACP’s actions did not violate any particular Alabama law, and all of its actions were constitutionally protected or controllable by other, more appropriate public remedies. Justice Harlan rejected Alabama’s contentions that the NAACP illegally 1) paid for two black students to attend the University of Alabama, 2) failed to disclose membership information, 3) made false allegations against state officials, 4) violated Alabama’s injunction, and 5) breached the peace, along with several other allegations. He argued that these activities were more related to the NAACP’s members’ freedom to associate for the collective advocacy of their ideas than to the NAACP’s privilege to do business in Alabama.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38936,"name":"Robert L.

Under the amended statute, contractors must pay a contractor’s tax, regardless of the source or destination of the product. Union Carbide Corp, H.K. Ferguson Co. — both of which hold AEC contracts — and the AEC sued Tennessee to recover the sales and contractor’s tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trial court dismissed the suit due to the existing statute, and the plaintiffs appealed. The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld state’s right to collect a contractor’s tax, but found that the companies should be reimbursed for the sales tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the imposition of the contractor’s tax violate the federal immunity from state taxation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the Constitution creates immunity from state taxes for the federal government and its properties, but that protection does not extend to federal contractors. Although a contractor may provide goods only to the federal government, the company still enters into a contract that results in financial compensation. Therefore, the contractor always stands to benefit financially and should not be immune from taxation. In this case, the Atomic Energy Commission chose to contract to separate companies rather than hire its own employees, so it may not confer tax immunities onto those contractors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice John M. Harlan wrote that this case might have been a good opportunity to reconsider the issue of federal immunity from state taxes. However, given the legislative history surrounding this case, he concurred in the judgment of the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15651,"name":"Archibald Cox, Jr.","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/archibald_cox_jr","view_count":0,"last_name":"Cox,","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"archibald_cox_jr"},"advocate_description":"for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21818"},{"advocate":{"ID":39658,"name":"R.

The judge admitted a can of black paint and a paintbrush into evidence.  A police officer obtained these items during a warrantless search of Fahy’s garage.  The Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut found that the brush and paint were products of an illegal search and should not have been admitted.  The court affirmed the convictions, however, holding that the error in admitting the evidence was harmless.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the trial court\u0027s error in admitting evidence obtained during an unlawful search harmless?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed the convictions, holding that the error was prejudicial.  The evidence itself was incriminating and the prosecution used it to corroborate opinion testimony that the brush matched the markings on the synagogue.  Justice John M. Harlan dissented, expressing that the U.S. Supreme Court should not interfere with state court findings on harmless errors.  Justice Tom C. Clark, Justice Potter Stewart, and Justice Byron R.

While on bail, Massiah had a conversation with one of his codefendants in the absence of counsel.  Unknown to Massiah, the codefendant became a government informer and allowed police to install a radio transmitter under the seat of his car.  A nearby government agent listened to the entire conversation by way of this transmitter.  Massiah made several incriminating statements.  At trial, the agent who listened to the conversation testified to the incriminating statements over Massiah’s objection.  The codefendant never testified.  A jury convicted Massiah and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre a defendant’s incriminating statements made without the presence of counsel after a criminal proceeding has begun admissible as evidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay a government agent testify to defendant’s incriminating statements that the agent overheard, via an informer with an electronic recording device, without the knowledge of defendant, when the informer does not testify at trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that incriminating statements deliberately elicited by federal agents in the absence of counsel after the proceeding has begun violate the Sixth Amendment.  The prosecution could not use these statements as evidence against Massiah.  Justice Byron R. White dissented, arguing that the statements should be admitted because they were voluntarily made and not coerced.  The absence of counsel was only one factor among many the court should consider in this situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38972,"name":"Robert J.

On appeal from a dismissal of their complaint by a three-judge district court, the Supreme Court granted the WMCA certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the apportionment formula contained in Article III, Sections 2-5, of the New York State constitution violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-to-3 decision, the Court began by noting that this case was property before it since no other political relief was available to the WMCA. The Court then held that New York\u0027s apportionment formula violated the Equal Protection Clause since it did not apportion the state\u0027s senate and assembly substantially on a population basis. Consequently, New York\u0027s legislative apportionment scheme significantly undervalued the weight of urban area voters as compared with their rural and less densely populated counterparts. This practice constituted a form of geographical discrimination that violated notions of equal protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14072,"title":"Oral Argument - November 12, 1963 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14072"},{"id":14390,"title":"Oral Argument - November 13, 1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14390"},{"id":14758,"title":"Oral Argument - November 12, 1963 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14758"}],"citation":{"volume":"377","page":"633","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25421"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Wesberry resided in a Georgia congressional district with a population two to three times greater than that of other congressional districts in the state. He asserted that because there was only one congressman for each district, his vote was debased as a result of the state apportionment statute and the state\u0027s failure to realign the congressional districts. Wesberry sought to invalidate the apportionment statute and enjoin defendants, the Governor and Secretary of State, from conducting elections under it. The district court dismissed the complaint for non-justiciability and want of equity. Wesberry appealed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Georgia\u0027s congressional districts violate the Fourteenth Amendment or deprive citizens of the full benefit of their right to vote?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eCongressional districts must have roughly equal populations if this is feasible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Hugo L. Black, the 6-3 majority held that the district court had jurisdiction because debasement of the right to vote as a result of a state congressional apportionment law was justiciable and not subject to dismissal for \"want of equity.\" The Court further held that the apportionment statute was invalid because it abridged the requirement of Article 1, section 2 of the Constitution that The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states, and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clark concurred in part and dissented in part. He agreed with the majority that the trial court erred in dismissing the case for nonjusticiability and want of equity, but stated further that Article 1, section 2, does not forbid disproportionate congressional districts and that the case should be remanded for a hearing to determine whether the apportionment statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan dissented on the ground that the Constitution expressly provides that state legislatures and Congress have exclusive jurisdiction over problems of congressional apportionment of the type involved in the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart stated that he joined with Mr. Justice Harlan\u0027s dissent except insofar as there might be implied in that dissent the view that the issues were not justiciable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14395,"title":"Oral Argument - November 18, 1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14395"},{"id":14581,"title":"Oral Argument - November 19, 1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14581"}],"citation":{"volume":"376","page":"1","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25428"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Sims, David J. Vann (of Vann v. Baggett), John McConnell (McConnell v. Baggett), and other voters from Jefferson County, Alabama, challenged the apportionment of the state legislature. Lines dividing electoral districts had resulted in dramatic population discrepancies among the districts. The state constitution required at least one representative per county and senatorial district. However, the district in Jefferson County, which is near Birmingham, contained 41 times as many eligible voters as those in another district of the state. Sims and the other voters argued that this lack of proportionality prevented them from effectively participating in a republican form of government.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Alabama\u0027s apportionment scheme violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause by mandating at least one representative per county and creating as many senatorial districts as there were senators, regardless of population variances?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eEqual protection requires that state legislative districts should be comprised of roughly equal populations if possible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an 8-to-1 decision authored by Justice Earl Warren, the Court upheld the challenge to the Alabama system, holding that Equal Protection Clause demanded \"no less than substantially equal state legislative representation for all citizens....\" Noting that the right to direct representation was \"a bedrock of our political system,\" the Court held that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned on a population basis. States were required to \"honest and good faith\" efforts to construct districts as nearly of equal population as practicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart concurred, agreeing with Warren that the Court could intervene to address egregious situations of misapportionment, Stewart sought to limit the application of this decision to clear violations of equal protection. He felt wary of imposing specific guidelines on states for how to redraw the district lines or setting a certain range of ratios that would be acceptable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan dissented, applying an originalist interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which in his opinion had not been meant by the drafters to protect voting rights. He suggested that the Court was intruding on federalism principles protecting the states in their control of local matters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clark concurred in a separate opinion. \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14097,"title":"Oral Argument - November 13, 1963 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14097"},{"id":14756,"title":"Oral Argument - November 13, 1963 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14756"}],"citation":{"volume":"377","page":"533","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25432"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The State\u0027s five most populous political subdivisions with over three-fourths of the 1960 population are represented by only slightly over one-third of the Senate\u0027s membership. In the House of Delegates, after temporary legislation in 1962, there existed a maximum population-variance ratio of almost 6-to-1. A group of residents, taxpayers, and voters brought suit, alleging that the legislative malapportionment violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ultimately, the circuit court held that as to certain counties there was invidious discrimination in the apportionment of the House and that the senatorial apportionment was constitutional. The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Maryland\u0027s apportionment scheme violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause by mandating one senator per county and legislative district of Baltimore, regardless of population variances?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 opinion deliver by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court held that neither house of the Maryland Legislature is apportioned sufficiently on a population basis to be constitutionally sustainable, based on the Court\u0027s ruling in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964). Finding that the validity of the apportionment of both houses of the Maryland legislature were before it, the Court found that neither house could be sustained under the Equal Protection Clause because of the gross disparities from population-based representation in the apportionment of Senate seats. \"Maryland\u0027s plan is plainly insufficient under the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause as spelled out in our opinion in Reynolds,\" wrote Chief Justice Warren.

Carr (369 U.S. 186) Richard Sincock and several other New Castle County residents, taxpayers, and qualified voters, challenged the constitutionality of Delaware\u0027s apportionment scheme. The suit alleged that under Delaware\u0027s 1897 state constitution, no provisions existed for reapportionment that would reflect the changing demographic face of New Castle County and the City of Wilmington. On a appeal from a three-judge district court ruling against the state of Delaware, the Supreme Court granted Mabel Roman, Delaware\u0027s elections clerk, certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Delaware\u0027s apportionment scheme violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause, by disregarding population as a basis for determining congressional districts?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-to-1 decision the Court held that Delaware\u0027s apportionment practices, as codified in its state constitution both before and after a 1963 amendment, violated the Due Process Clause. Delaware\u0027s system of having one upper house apportioned on a geographical basis and one lower house apportioned on population basis was unconstitutional since population is the only permissible guide to apportionment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14122,"title":"Oral Argument - December 09, 1963 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14122"},{"id":14706,"title":"Oral Argument - December 09, 1963 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14706"}],"citation":{"volume":"377","page":"695","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25451"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The ad contained several minor factual inaccuracies. The city Public Safety Commissioner, L.B. Sullivan, felt that the criticism of his subordinates reflected on him, even though he was not mentioned in the ad. Sullivan sent a written request to the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e to publicly retract the information, as required for a public figure to seek punitive damages in a libel action under Alabama law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e refused and claimed that they were puzzled by the request, Sullivan filed a libel action against the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e and a group of African American ministers mentioned in the ad. A jury in state court awarded him $500,000 in damages. The state supreme court affirmed and the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e appealed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Alabama\u0027s libel law unconstitutionally infringe on the First Amendment\u0027s freedom of speech and freedom of press protections?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eTo sustain a claim of defamation or libel, the First Amendment requires that the plaintiff show that the defendant knew that a statement was false or was reckless in deciding to publish the information without investigating whether it was accurate. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Brennan, the Court ruled for the \u003cem\u003eTimes\u003c/em\u003e. When a statement concerns a public figure, the Court held, it is not enough to show that it is false for the press to be liable for libel. Instead, the target of the statement must show that it was made with knowledge of or reckless disregard for its falsity. Brennan used the term \"actual malice\" to summarize this standard, although he did not intend the usual meaning of a malicious purpose. In libel law, “malice” had meant knowledge or gross recklessness rather than intent, since courts found it difficult to imagine that someone would knowingly disseminate false information without a bad intent. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28367,"name":"Herbert Wechsler","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/herbert_wechsler","view_count":0,"last_name":"Wechsler","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"herbert_wechsler"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21592"},{"advocate":{"ID":45998,"name":"William P.

The Supreme Court of New York dismissed the appeal, because the original order was not final.

Under Colorado\u0027s apportionment plan, the House of Representatives was apportioned on the basis of population but the apportionment of the Senate was based on a combination of population and other factors (geography, compactness and contiguity, accessibility, natural boundaries, and conformity to historical divisions). Consequently, counties with only about one-third of the State\u0027s total population would elect a majority of the Senate; the maximum population-variance ratio would be about 3.6-to-1; and the chief metropolitan areas, with over two-thirds of the State\u0027s population, could elect only a bare majority of the Senate. When a three-judge District Court upheld the plan, stressing its recent approval by the electorate, the Supreme Court granted Lucas certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a majority-approved state apportionment plan that permits one house of its congress to be largely apportioned on the basis of factors other than population distribution in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-to-3 opinion, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause requires all districts to be substantially apportioned on a population bases. While noting that some deviation from strict population considerations may be permitted to offset minor underrepresentations of one group or another, the wholesale neglect of population considerations is unconstitutional. The Court added that although a majority of the Colorado electorate approved its apportionment scheme, this cannot override even a single individual\u0027s constitutionally protected right to cast an equally weighted vote. The apportionment of Colorado\u0027s Senate rendered population considerations virtually insignificant, and was therefore unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14591,"title":"Oral Argument - April 01, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14591"},{"id":14774,"title":"Oral Argument - March 31, 1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14774"}],"citation":{"volume":"377","page":"713","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25505"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

When the Supreme Court decided \u003ci\u003eBrown v. Board of Education in 1954\u003c/i\u003e, this case and others like it were remanded to the lower courts to order desegregation. Prince Edward County resisted desegregation by refusing to levy and collect the school taxes for the 1959-1960 school year, which forced the public schools in the county to close. The Prince Edward School Foundation formed to ensure private education for the white students. African American students did not receive formal education from 1959 until 1963, when federal, state, and county authorities collaborated to hold desegregated classes in county-owned buildings. In 1960, the Prince Edward Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance providing tuition grants for the children attending the private schools of the Prince Edward School Foundation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1961, the petitioners amended their original complaint to include new respondents and the elements of failing to provide public free schools in the county and using public funds to pay for segregated private schools. The district court held that the county could not pay the tuition grants as long as the public school remained closed, but the court refrained from making a decision regarding the closed public schools until the Virginia courts ruled on the issue. Later, without waiting for the decision of the Virginia courts, the district court held that the public schools must reopen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decisions on the grounds that the district court should have waited until the state courts determined the validity of the tuition grants and the closing of the public schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the closing of the Prince Edward County public schools deny the African American students in the county equal protection under the law as guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Hugo L. Black authored the opinion of the 7-2 majority, in which the Court held that the closing of the county’s schools denied the African American children an education that was available to their white peers. Although the closing of public schools is not unconstitutional in itself, when schools are closed for the express purpose of denying education to a group of children based on race, the action violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also held that the district court had the power to order the county to collect the necessary taxes and to reopen the public schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a jointly filed dissenting opinion, Justice Tom C. Clark and Justice John M. Harlan disagreed with the holding that the district court could order the county to reopen the public schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38936,"name":"Robert L.

Over several hours, the police refused his repeated requests to see his lawyer. Escobedo subsequently confessed to murder. Escobedo appealed the affirmation of his conviction of murder by the Supreme Court of Illinois, which held that petitioner\u0027s confession had been admissible even though it was obtained after he had requested and been denied the assistance of counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Escobedo denied the right to counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eAs soon as someone is in the custody of law enforcement, he or she has a Sixth Amendment right to speak to an attorney. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Goldberg, the Court ruled that Escobedo’s Sixth Amendment rights had been violated. The Court reasoned that the period between arrest and indictment was a critical stage at which an accused needed the advice of counsel perhaps more than at any other. A suspect who was being interrogated by police while in custody, who had not been warned of his right to remain silent, and who had requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, had been denied the assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Any statement elicited under such circumstances could not be used against him at a criminal trial. The Court therefore reversed Escobedo’s judgment and remanded for further proceedings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan dissented, opining that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois should be affirmed because the majority\u0027s conclusion would unjustifiably fetter legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart dissented on the grounds that the right to assistance of counsel should not attach until the formal institution of proceedings by indictment, information, or arraignment, and that the majority\u0027s holding would have an unfortunate impact on the fair administration of criminal justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice White, joined by Clark and Stewart, dissented on the grounds that the majority\u0027s decision will be applicable whenever the accused becomes a suspect, rendering admissions to the police inadmissible unless the accused waives his right to counsel and rendering the task of law enforcement more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14192,"title":"Oral Argument - April 29, 1964 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14192"},{"id":14645,"title":"Oral Argument - April 29, 1964 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14645"}],"citation":{"volume":"378","page":"478","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25529"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Jackson drew a gun and took money from the clerk, then ordered the clerk and others upstairs before leaving the hotel. Outside, Jackson encountered a policeman. Both men drew their guns, and in the ensuing altercation, the policeman was fatally wounded and Jackson was shot twice. When a police detective questioned Jackson at the hospital around 2 a.m., he admitted to the robbery and to shooting the police officer. Jackson received pain medication and was questioned again around 4 a.m. He again admitted to the robbery and the shooting. An hour later, Jackson was taken into the operating room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson and Elliot were indicted and tried together. His two confessions were admitted into evidence without objection. In his testimony, Jackson testified to being pressured into answering questions in the hospital, which the state denied. Consistent with New York practice, the question of the validity of the confession was submitted to the jury along with the other issues. The jury found Jackson guilty and sentenced him to death. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court denied certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson submitted a petition for habeas corpus alleging that the New York procedure for determining the voluntariness of confession was unconstitutional and that his statement was involuntary. The district court denied the petition. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the New York procedure governing the admissibility of allegedly involuntary confessions constitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the New York procedure did not allow for a reliable determination of whether or not the confessions were voluntary. Because the judge does not rule on the issue and the jury only reports on the ultimate question of guilt or innocence, there is no way to determine whether the jury found he confession voluntary. Without this information, there is no way to ensure that the defendant’s rights are protected. The Court also held that, in cases where there is insufficient evidence to find the defendant guilty without the confession, the jury will take the defendant’s guilt into account when considering the voluntariness of the confession. Because there are issues of fact in question, the Court remanded the case to that state courts, rather than the federal court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He argued that the question of whether a confession is voluntary should remain in the hands of the jury, per the New York procedure. Allowing the judge to rule on the voluntariness of the statement prior to the jury could only distort the jury’s findings and downgrade the value of the trial by jury. He agreed with the majority that the statements in this case were involuntary. Justice Tom C. Clark joined in the opinion concurring part and dissenting in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Tom C. Clark argued that the New York procedure was not in question because no objection was raised when the evidence was introduced in trial. Because this objection was not raised, it was improper for the majority to rule on the issue. He also argued that the question of voluntariness of a statement is an issue for the jury to consider, not a trial judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a dissent and argued that issues such as the voluntariness of a confession should be decided by the jury, as the jury trial is the cornerstone of the US judicial system. He also argued that the majority’s opinion was inconsistent with previous rulings that upheld that primacy of the jury. Additionally, Justice Harlan wrote that limits should only be placed on the states’ ability to prevent criminal conduct when their actions infringe on “rights fundamental to a decent society,” which he argues this issue does not. Justice Tom C. Clark and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20691,"name":"Daniel G.

Harrison called for a redistribution of legislative representation among the counties and independent cities of the state \"substantially in proportion to their respective populations.\" When Levin Davis appealed an adverse three-judge district court ruling on behalf of Virginia\u0027s Secretary and State Board of Elections, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Virginia\u0027s apportionment scheme violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-to-1 decision, the Court noted that under the Fourteenth Amendment all bicameral state legislatures must substantially apportion both seats of their houses on a population basis. In Virginia\u0027s case, neither of its legislative houses was apportioned on a population basis. Virginia\u0027s claim that the underrepresented counties were composed primarily of military personnel and their families, who often only resided in the state for relatively short periods of time, did not constitute a defense to its actions. Instead, this amounted to discrimination against a class of individuals merely because of the nature of their employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14372,"title":"Oral Argument - November 18, 1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14372"},{"id":14587,"title":"Oral Argument - November 14, 1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14587"}],"citation":{"volume":"377","page":"678","year":"1964","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25542"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

On March 15, 1960, the petitioners, five black college students, sat at the counter and waited to be served. The previous day, the store manager arranged for police officers to be present in case of such a situation. After announcing that he would not serve the students and requesting that they leave, the store manager and one of the officers spoke individually to each petitioner. When they would not leave, the petitioners were arrested and charged criminal trespass and breach of the peace. The Recorder’s Court convicted the petitioners, and the County Court affirmed, as did the Supreme Court of South Carolina.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the arrests and subsequent convictions of the participants in a lunch counter sit-in violate their Fourteenth Amendment rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court held that there was no evidence that the petitioners’ conduct was anything other than polite and could not be construed as a breach of the peace. Given that the only evidence for a potential breach of peace was in the actions of hostile onlookers, there was no reason to arrest and convict the petitioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas concurred and cited the reasons stated in his opinion in \u003ci\u003eBell v. Maryland\u003c/i\u003e. In his opinion in that case, Justice Douglas argued that the segregation of public places drastically and negatively affects the lives of black Americans. It is a relic of slavery and second-class citizenship that is antithetical to the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Arthur J. Goldberg concurred and cited the reasons stated in his concurring opinion in \u003ci\u003eBell v. Maryland\u003c/i\u003e. Chief Justice Earl Warren joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Hugo L. Black argued that the conviction for trespassing should stand, as the police acted correctly in removing the petitioners from the property after they had been asked to leave. Justice John M. Harlan and Justice Byron R. White joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36498,"name":"Matthew J.
