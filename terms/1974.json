The New York statute required recipients to cooperate in a support action against a missing parent or they would not receive benefits.  The Social Security Act contained no such requirement.  A three-judge district court in the Northern District of New York agreed and ruled in favor of the respondents.  The Supreme Court heard the case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the New York welfare law requiring cooperation in a support action against a missing parent unconstitutionally conflict with the Social Security Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court affirmed the district court.  The court noted that since the district court\u0027s decision, the Social Security Act was amended to almost mirror that section of the New York welfare statute.  The amendment would become effective just over three months after the Supreme Court\u0027s decision so the Court declined to deliver an extended opinion.  Justices Lewis F.

After obtaining information from the public record, a television station broadcast the name of Cohn\u0027s daughter in connection with the incident.

Justice White recognized the primacy of issues of privacy and press freedom, but he also identified compelling reasons why the press should not be restricted in this case. First, the news media is an important resource for citizens which allows them to scrutinize government proceedings. The commissions and adjudication of crimes are issues relevant to the public interest. Second, in the development of the privacy right, the Court has held that the interests of privacy \"fade\" in cases where controversial \"information already appears on the public record.\" Restricting the media as the Georgia law did was a dangerous encroachment on press freedom, argued White, as it \"would invite timidity and self-censorship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33898,"name":"Kirk M.

Citing prior holdings such as New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), Justice Blackmun denied the Supreme Court of Virginia\u0027s ruling that commercial speech is not afforded First Amendment protection. Furthermore, the advertisement in question contained important information in the \"public interest\" which went beyond merely informing readers of a commercial service.

Colonial challenged a Louisiana corporation franchise tax, stating that all of their business in Louisiana was interstate.  Colonial maintained no offices in Louisiana and delivered no petroleum intrastate, but they did have several employees in Louisiana.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal held the tax unconstitutional as a state regulation on interstate commerce.  The Supreme Court of Louisiana reversed, holding that the tax was not on interstate commerce, but on corporate business done in Louisiana.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Louisiana corporate franchise tax an unconstitutional tax on interstate commerce?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion affirming the lower court 7-1.  The Supreme Court held that the tax was justified because Colonial had voluntarily qualified to do business in Louisiana, and gained benefits and protections from Louisiana.  The Court also held that the tax was not discriminatory or unfairly apportioned.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a concurrence stating that the tax did not threaten state commerce by being discriminatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent, asserting that Louisiana’s tax was solely on the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce, making it unconstitutional.

Murphy filed for change of venue because of media coverage of his previous crimes. Murphy was made famous by his involvement in the 1964 jewel heist of the “Star of India,” a rare precious sapphire that was housed at the New York Museum of Natural History. Murphy was given the nickname “Murph the Surf” in national media coverage. Murphy had also been arrested and indicted for the double murder of two women in Florida, which was nationally known as the “Whiskey Creek Murders.” Murphy contends that the national publicity surrounding these two convictions tainted the jury and that his right to fair trial was violated. The motion was denied, and Murphy was convicted. After his conviction, Murphy petitioned for habeas corpus and argued that the denial of his request to change venue resulted in a violation of his right to a fair trial. The district court held that the jury was properly screened for prejudice and dismissed his petition. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the petitioner’s right to a fair trial violated by potential prejudice of the jury as a result of national publicity surrounding previous crimes?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNational news coverage of the defendant’s previous crimes was not sufficient to establish a presumption of jury prejudice in violation of the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion for the 8-1 majority. The Court held that because the jury selection process was sufficiently thorough to exclude prejudice of the jurors, the petitioner’s right to a fair trial was not violated. The Court looked at other cases involving jury prejudice because of previous media attention and determined that they did not control the outcome in this case, as the jury members who were selected only had brief exposure to Murphy’s previous crimes and stated that they did not think the previous crimes influenced his guilt in this case. Although there was precedent that stated that certain circumstances could create a high potential for prejudice, the Court determined that precedent applied only in federal courts as an exercise of the Court’s supervisory powers over federal courts rather than as a constitutional rule that applied to state courts as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurrence in the judgment, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that, while the trial judge should have shown more discretion in jury selection, the circumstances of the trial in this case did not rise to the level of violating the defendant’s rights to fair trial and due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent in which he argued that Murphy’s request for venue change should have been granted because some of the jurors did show prejudice regarding Murphy’s previous convictions, and therefore that he had been denied a fair trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28149,"name":"Harvey S.

He filed a request to represent himself in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. The judge initially accepted the request, but later called Faretta back in to question him about his knowledge of the hearsay rule and other court procedures. Based on Faretta’s answers, the judge determined that Faretta did not intelligently and knowingly waive his right to counsel and the judge appointed a public defender. The jury convicted Faretta. On appeal, the California Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that Faretta had no constitutional right to represent himself. The California Supreme Court denied review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a defendant be denied the right to present his own defense and be forced to accept representation by counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a 6-3 majority, vacated the state court judgment and remanded the case.  The Supreme Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has the constitutional right to defend himself when he voluntarily and intelligently wants to do so.  In this case, Faretta was deprived of that constitutional right.  Farretta’s knowledge of the hearsay rule and court procedure was irrelevant to whether he voluntarily waived his right to counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented, arguing that the Constitution provides no basis for a right to self-representation.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.  Justice Blackmun wrote a separate dissent, arguing that the text of the Sixth Amendment does not support the right to self-representation, and such a right will lead to procedural confusion without providing any benefit to the accused.  Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30239,"name":"Jerome B.

After the hearing, the court determined that Jones should be prosecuted as an adult.  Jones filed for habeas corpus, arguing that the criminal trial put him in double jeopardy.  The trial court, court of appeal, and Supreme Court of California denied the writ.  The case went to trial and the court found Jones guilty of robbery in the first degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones again filed for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal district court.  The court denied the petition, holding that hearings before juvenile court and criminal trials are so different that double jeopardy did not apply.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court reasoned that the application of double jeopardy would not impede the juvenile courts.  The court also held that allowing the criminal verdict to stand would destroy confidence in the judicial system.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Gary Jones put in double jeopardy when he was tried as an adult after an adjudication hearing in juvenile court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a unanimous decision, Chief Justice Warren Burger delivered the opinion of the court vacating the lower court decision and remanding.  The unanimous Supreme Court held that the criminal trial put Jones in jeopardy for a second time.  The Court suggested that juvenile courts make determinations about whether to try a juvenile as an adult at a preliminary hearing before any adjudication is made.  This would avoid any double jeopardy and allow juveniles to be tried as adults when appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40826,"name":"Robert L.

The city attorney requested a subpoena to produce 52 such magazines in order to obtain an injunction to prevent their further sale.  Maness advised his client not to produce the magazines and invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  The judge ordered the production of the magazines, accepting the city clerk’s argument that the Fifth Amendment privilege did not apply in a civil proceeding.  When Maness’ client still refused to produce the magazines, the judge held Maness and his client in contempt of court and sentenced them to 10 days in jail and a $200 fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother state district judge reviewed and affirmed the contempt conviction, but changed the penalty to a $500 fine and no jail time.  The Texas appeals courts and the Supreme Court of Texas refused to review the judgment.  Maness filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of himself and his client in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, which granted the petition.  The district court noted that civil and criminal charges in this case would arise under the same Texas statute, so the Fifth Amendment applied.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held its judgment pending Supreme Court review of the contempt conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan an attorney be held in contempt of court for counseling his client, in good faith, to refuse to produce evidence the attorney feels may incriminate the client?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote the unanimous majority opinion, holding that Maness could not be held in contempt for giving advice in good faith.  The Supreme Court rejected the argument that the client should have produced the magazines and then appealed the decision to let them in as evidence.  The Court noted that sometimes it is impossible to “unring the bell” and Maness took the proper course to protect his client.  The Court also noted that the record showed no evidence of willfully disobedient conduct by Maness or his client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a concurrence, stating that punishing an attorney for acting in good faith would violate due process as an arbitrary interference with a client’s right to the advice of counsel.  Justice Bryon R. White also wrote a concurrence, noting that the trial court gave no assurance that the client would not be convicted based on the magazines.  Justice White would have vacated the contempt judgment and given the client another opportunity to answer the questions with those assurances.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":46542,"name":"William F.

This caused damage to Vella’s inner ear, making it difficult for him to balance.   Doctors ruled the condition permanent and incurable.   A jury awarded Vella maintenance and cure for his injury.  The district court denied the ship owner’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  The ship owner argued that because the injury was permanent, maintenance and cure was not permissible.  The appellate court reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the ship owner required to pay maintenance and cure to a seaman who was injured on the job, even though his injury is permanent?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a unanimous decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion reversing and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that the ship owner must pay maintenance and cure from the time of the injury through the time the injury was deemed permanent.  The Court felt that not requiring payment would lead to unwanted situations where a worker had to pay back maintenance and cure once his injury was diagnosed as incurable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34651,"name":"Leonard C.

Upon questioning the passengers, the agents determined that they were illegal immigrants. The agents arrested everyone, and Brignoni-Ponce was charged with two counts of knowingly transporting illegal immigrants. At trial, Brignoni-Ponce moved to suppress the statements of the passengers as the fruits of an illegal seizure. The trial court denied the motion, and Brignoni-Ponce was convicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Brignoni-Ponce’s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, which held that the Fourth Amendment prevents roving patrols from searching vehicles without warrant or probably cause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the principles of Almeida-Sanchez applied to this case and held that the trial court should have granted the motion to suppress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment prohibit Border Patrol agents from stopping a vehicle and questioning its occupants based solely on their appearance?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 9-0 majority. The Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment required there to be reasonable suspicion for border patrol agents to stop a vehicle and question its occupants. This requirement allows the government to act in the public interest of ensuring legal immigration without infringing on the rights of legal immigrants and others. Because the border patrol agents in this case did not have a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing when they stopped Brignoni-Ponce’s vehicle, the motion to suppress any testimony gained from that illegal seizure should have been suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that the majority’s decision only pertains to roving patrols and that there are many other cases in which stopping a vehicle would not be constitutionally suspect. In his opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the Fourth Amendment required the police to show probable cause to stop a vehicle, and any lower standard unreasonably weakened the protections of the Fourth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a separate opinion concurring in judgment in which he argued that the idea of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment must take all the circumstances into account when weighing the public interest against the rights of the individual. Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the opinion concurring in judgment. In his separate opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Byron R. White wrote that the majority’s opinion strains the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in an attempt to solve the immigration problem that could be better handled by legislative action. Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29619,"name":"John J.

The practice granted the aliens “special immigrant” status and authorized them to be “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” even though the workers did not intend to reside in the U.S. permanently.  This “special” status, authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act, exempted the workers from normal documentation requirements.  The United Farmworkers Organizing committee sued for injunctive relief from the practice.  The district court dismissed the case, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that special status was permissible for daily workers, but not for seasonal workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs it proper for the INS to grant aliens who commute to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico the ability to be “lawfully admitted for permanent residence”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority affirming the lower court as to daily workers, but reversing as to seasonal workers.  The Supreme Court held that even if workers did not intend to reside in the U.S., they were still entitled to the ability to do so.  The Court noted that the practice was longstanding and had since Congress had impliedly approved it.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, stating that the plain meaning of the statute did not allow foreign commuters to be considered “permanent residents”.  Justice White felt the statute was not ambiguous so the administrative practice was not authoritative.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35781,"name":"Mark L.

The ICC rejected all but three applications.  Bowman Transportation, Inc., one of the approved applicants, asked for more authority than initially set out in their application.  The ICC granted that authority, and the competing motor carriers sued in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas to annul the certificate.  The district court found the ICC’s actions arbitrary and capricious.  The court voided the certificates and permanently enjoined the ICC from issuing them.  The Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWere the ICC’s grant of certificates arbitrary and capricious?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a unanimous decision, Justice William O. Douglas wrote the majority opinion reversing and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that the ICC based its decisions on consideration of relevant factors.

The tax resulted in a price mark-up for liquor sold on military installations.  The MTC sent a letter to liquor distributors advising that if the tax was not collected directly from the military, the distributors could face criminal charges.  The United States paid the tax and sought summary judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.  The United States argued that the mark-up was an unconstitutional tax on the federal government.  The district court upheld the regulation, ruling that the Twenty-First Amendment allowed the tax.  The Supreme Court reversed the district court and remanded.  On remand, the district court held that the tax was a permissible sales tax on the liquor distributors and not a tax on the federal government.  Two of the military installments had concurrent jurisdiction with both the federal and Mississippi government.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the MTC tax an unconstitutional tax on an instrumentality of the federal government?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 7-2 decision Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion reversing the district court.  The Supreme Court held that the legal responsibility for the tax fell on the military and so upon the U.S. federal government.  This made the tax unconstitutional per \u003ci\u003eMcCulloch v. Maryland\u003c/i\u003e.  The Court also held that the Twenty-First Amendment did not abolish federal immunity from taxes on the sale of liquor.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent, stating that both the Twenty-First Amendment and the Buck Act authorized the regulation.  Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42099,"name":"Stuart A.

This left several justices of the peace and constables without positions before the end of their terms.  The justices of the peace and constables sued to enjoin the redistricting, alleging equal protection and state constitutional violations.  Under the Texas state constitution, a justice of the peace could only be removed from office before the end of an elected term if given notice and a jury trial.  A three-judge federal district court held that the redistricting violated the Equal Protection Clause because it removed some officials but not others.  The court did not decided the state constitutional issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Harris County redistricting violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo answer.  In an 8-1 decision, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the majority opinion reversing and remanding to the district court.  The Supreme Court held that the district court should have answered the state law questions and abstained from the federal question.  Because of the unsettled nature of the state law question, the Court felt it was possible to modify or avoid the equal protection issue depending on how the court interpreted the state constitution.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent, stating that the question of whether to decide the state law issues should have been left to the district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22684,"name":"Edward J.

The unions were opposed to the low wages paid to foreign seamen.  Mobile Steamship Association sued to enjoin the picketing because it prevented the loading and unloading of ships.  The circuit court granted a temporary injunction and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.  The courts held that the picketing did not “affect commerce” within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), so the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) did not have jurisdiction.  The courts also held that enjoining the picketing did not violate the First Amendment because the picketing resulted in a work stoppage, not just the expression of ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the NLRB have jurisdiction over the picketers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did enjoining the picketers violate freedom of expression under the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion affirming the injunction.  The Supreme Court held that the NLRB did not have jurisdiction because the affected ship was not “in” or “affecting” commerce as defined by the NLRA.  This case was not distinguishable from \u003ci\u003eWindward v. American Radio Assn.\u003c/i\u003e, which involved owners of the foreign ships.  The Court also held that the injunction did not violate the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent, agreeing with Justice Stewart and emphasizing the importance of the public interest in keeping marine traffic safe.  Justice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent, stating that this dispute was within the sole jurisdiction of the NLRB.  Justices Douglas, William J. Brennan, and Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28060,"name":"Howard Schulman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/howard_schulman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Schulman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"howard_schulman"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9735"},{"advocate":{"ID":24358,"name":"Frank McRight","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/frank_mcright","view_count":0,"last_name":"McRight","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"frank_mcright"},"advocate_description":"for respondent Mobile Steamship Association, Inc","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9736"},{"advocate":{"ID":16456,"name":"Alex F.

The court fined each man $10.  Rather than seeking a trial in the county court and risking a harsher punishment, the men sued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  They sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, and equitable relief in the form of removal of their arrest and conviction records.  The district court denied relief and dismissed the claim, holding that declaratory relief was unavailable because there was no pending criminal prosecution or allegation of bad faith prosecution.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed without an opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan Ellis and Love seek declaratory and equitable relief after being fined under an allegedly unconstitutional ordinance?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eMaybe.  In a 6-3 decision, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion reversing and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that the Fifth Circuit relied on a rule that the Supreme Court later overturned.  Since the district court ruling, the Supreme Court held that pending or bad faith prosecution was not necessary for declaratory relief.  The Court remanded for the district court to reassess the case based on the new precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a concurrence, asserting that it was correct to remand the case to the district court.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a partial concurrence, stating that he would affirm the dismissal of Ellis and Love’s request for equitable relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell wrote a dissent, stating that equitable relief was barred by the nolo contendere pleas and the deliberate choice to forgo state appellate remedies.  Justice Potter Stewart joined in this part of the dissent.  Justice Powell also expressed that he would affirm the dismissal of the constitutional challenge to the ordinance.  Justice Stewart and Justice Warren Burger joined in this part of the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17909,"name":"Burt Neuborne","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/burt_neuborne","view_count":0,"last_name":"Neuborne","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"burt_neuborne"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9743"},{"advocate":{"ID":20642,"name":"Douglas H.

Taylor was indicted on kidnapping charges by the grand jury of St. Tammany Parish. The day before his trial was supposed to start, he filed a motion to quash the petit jury that was selected for his trial because he argued that women were systematically excluded, which denied him a right to trial by a jury of his peers. Although 53% of eligible jurors in his district were female, only 10% of the jury wheel was female. This discrepancy was due to an article of the Louisiana Constitution that specifies that a woman could not be selected for jury service unless she had previously submitted a written declaration of her desire to serve. The trial court dismissed Taylor’s motion, and he was tried and found guilty. He appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which held that the article regulating women’s jury service did not violate federal law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an article of the Louisiana state constitution that limits female jury service violate a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a jury of his peers?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 8-1 majority. The Court held that a jury made up of a representative cross-section of the community is an essential component of the Sixth Amendment. The article, while not actively disqualifying women from serving on the jury, systematically prevented many women from serving. Given the passage of the Federal Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 that guarantees a fair cross-section of the population for juries in federal courts, the Court held that Congress clearly considered a representative jury necessary for a fair trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred in the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that the Sixth Amendment only prevented the use of jury selection procedures that were likely to result in an unfair or biased jury. Since there was no evidence that the article in the Louisiana state constitution undermined jury fairness or that Taylor’s trial was biased, the Court should not overturn the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45243,"name":"William McM.

In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that because Ohio had chosen to extend the right to an education to its citizens, it could not withdraw that right \"on grounds of misconduct absent fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct ha[d] occurred.\" The Court held that Ohio was constrained to recognize students\u0027 entitlements to education as property interests protected by the Due Process Clause that could not be taken away without minimum procedures required by the Clause. The Court found that students facing suspension should at a minimum be given notice and afforded some kind of hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42416,"name":"Thomas A.

This nonprofit organization had actively published newsletters and sponsored coffeehouses in which discussions critical of the Vietnam War took place.

Burger disregarded the Fund\u0027s claim that the investigation was being conducted to expose its beliefs, many of which were \"unorthodox or unpopular.\" He reasoned that the legitimacy of a congressional investigatory action is not derived from the motives of the members or by the information that the investigation uncovers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27551,"name":"Herbert J.

The union wanted Connell to sign an agreement promising only to subcontract mechanical work to Union members.  Connell sued to enjoin the picketing.  Connell signed the agreement with the union under protest, and amended its complaint to allege antitrust violations.  The district court held that the agreement was exempt from federal antitrust laws under a provision of the National Labor Relations Act.  Also, federal labor laws pre-empted state antitrust laws.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an agreement with a union to do business only with members violate state and federal antitrust laws?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eMaybe.  Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote the 5-4 majority opinion affirming on state law pre-emption, but reversing on federal antitrust exemption.

The theater showed an R-rated film containing female nudity, which violated a Jacksonville city ordinance that prohibited the showing of films containing nudity if the film was visible from a public area. Richard Erznoznik, the theater\u0027s manager, was charged with a Class C offense under the ordinance. He challenged the ordinance in Duval County Circuit Court, which upheld the statute. The District Court of Appeal of Florida, First District, affirmed the decision. The Supreme Court of Florida denied certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Jacksonville\u0027s ordinance violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 decision, the Court struck down the Jacksonville ordinance. While individuals did have a right to not be exposed to offensive films, the ordinance singled out \"some kinds of speech on the ground that they are more offensive than others,\" Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote for the majority. Since the \"offended viewer readily can avert his eyes\" from the films shown, Jacksonville\u0027s distinction between films with nudity and films without nudity was unconstitutional. Under \u003cem\u003ePolice Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley\u003c/em\u003e, \"government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\" The ordinance was \"broader than permissible\" in trying to protect children from exposure to nudity and \"invalid\" as an attempt to prevent traffic accidents. Justice William O. Douglas authored a concurring opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36360,"name":"Michael A.

Her service was terminated in September 1970 due to a lack of payment. Jackson opened another account under the name of another resident, James Dodson. Metropolitan Edison investigated her residence on October 6, 1971 and service was again terminated without notice on October 11. Jackson sued in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. She sought damages for the termination and an injunction to continue her service. The court dismissed her suit.

Rehnquist, the court affirmed the Third Circuit and held that Metropolitan Edison\u0027s termination of Jackson\u0027s service did not qualify as state action. Rehnquist reiterated that private actions are \"immune from the restrictions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" The Court acknowledged that Metropolitan Edison was heavily regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, but this regulation did not make Metropolitan Edison part of the state. Additionally, the Court cited \u003cem\u003eNebbia v.

They heard about a school meeting where both parents and students would be present and decided to spike the punch with alcohol. Ten days later, Mrs. Curtis Powell, a teacher at the high school, learned of the prank and confronted the girls. The girls confessed based on the understanding that she would handle their punishment. The next day, the teacher informed the girls that the principal, P. T. Waller, heard about the incident and she would not be able to help them unless they confessed to the principal. The girls did so, and Mr. Waller suspended them for two weeks pending a decision by the school board. The school board voted to suspend the girls for the rest of the semester. The girls, their parents, and their counsel were present at a subsequent meeting to ask the board to reconsider the suspensions. The board denied the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrickland and Crain sued the members of the school board, administrators, and the school district of Mena, Arkansas for damages resulting from their suspension, which they claimed violated their right to due process. The jury could not reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. The district court directed a verdict for the school board because there was no evidence of malice toward the girls. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a school district be liable for a violation of Due Process if there is no evidence that the violation was committed with malice?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the common law doctrine of immunity for public school officials provided immunity from liability if the school board acted in good faith. To impose a penalty of liability for such a decision would make the board vulnerable to intimidation. The Court also held that, to prove the board acted in bad faith, the evidence must show that the school board members knew or should have known that their actions would violate the constitutional rights of the students. Given the information available to the school board at the time of the decision, the Court found that the school board acted in good faith. The Court also held the United States Court of Appeals went beyond its purview by reinterpreting the school board statute. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell wrote on opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He agreed that the case should be remanded but argued that the majority’s opinion placed too high a burden on school board officials by equating ignorance of the law with malicious intent. He cited recent split decisions on the part of the Court as evidence that even knowledge of the law did not necessarily lead to an understanding of a clear course of action. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26160,"name":"G.

Polatschek had worked as a teacher for the five years prior to their marriage and continued teaching after they were married. Her salary was the principle source of the couple’s income, and social security contributions were regularly deducted from her salary. In 1972, Polatschek died in childbirth, which left Wiesenfeld with the care of their newborn son. Wiesenfeld applied for social security benefits for himself and his son, and was told that his son could receive them but that he could not. Social Security Act provides benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband and father that are available to both the children and the widow. The benefits for a deceased wife and mother, however, are only available to the children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1973, Wiesenfeld sued on behalf of himself and similarly situated widowers. He claimed that the relevant section of the Social Security Act unfairly discriminated on the basis of sex and sought summary judgment. A three-judge panel of the district court granted Wiesenfeld’s motion for summary judgment\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the gender-based distinction in Social Security benefits violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority. The Supreme Court held that the purpose of the social security benefits for the surviving spouse and children is to enable the surviving spouse to properly care for the children, regardless of the gender of the parent. Gender-based discrimination regarding these benefits is therefore both illogical and counter-productive. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that the gender-based classification of the social security benefits does not serve any legitimate government interest. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in the concurring opinion. In his opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that the majority’s opinion overreached the bounds of the question by ruling on whether the statute violated the Fifth Amendment. He argued that the statute does not serve a valid legislative purpose and could be overturned on that basis alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas did not participate in either the discussion or the decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33866,"name":"Keith A.

Richard A. Gordon, on behalf of a class of independent investors, sued the New York Stock Exchange and member firms claiming fixed commission rates and exorbitant membership fees violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Blackmun wrote the unanimous opinion.  The Supreme Court held that the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 impliedly repealed any applicable antitrust laws.  The Act authorized the Securities and Exchange Commission as the sole regulator for the New York Stock Exchange.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a concurrence, stating that the SEC has actively exercised its authority so commission rates are monitored in the way Congress intended.  Justice Potter Stewart also wrote a concurrence, emphasizing that rules fixing commission rates are only immune from antitrust laws if the rules are necessary to make the Securities and Exchange Act work.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28490,"name":"I.

In 1966, after filing a race discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the respondents sued Albemarle Paper Co. and the plant’s labor union, Halifax Local 425, and sought permanent injunctive relief against any plant “policy, practice, custom, or usage” that violates Title VII of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. In 1970, the plaintiffs moved to add a class demand for backpay.\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, the court found that the plant’s seniority system was racially segregated and ordered the plant to implement a new system. The court did not award backpay because the company did not act in bad faith and respondents added the demand four years after the action was initiated. The court also did not enjoin Albemarle’s use of pre-employment tests. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and held that the district court should have awarded backpay and enjoined the use of the pre-employment tests. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Should the district court have awarded backpay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Can an employer avoid suits under the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 by proving that discriminatory hiring tests are job-related?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 7-1 majority. The Court held that backpay should be awarded based on a court’s discretion. The decision in this case should be considered in light of the goals of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. Because the prospect of a backpay award could ensure the use of equal employment practices, it serves the purposes of the Act and should be awarded in this case. Finding that the employer did not act in bad faith is not a sufficient reason to deny backpay. The Court also held that district courts have the authority to award backpay based on the legislative history surrounding the Act, regardless of when the demand was added to the action. The Court held that nothing in the Act precluded the use of employment tests, but only if they can be proven to be reasonable measures of job performance. Based on the Guidelines issued by the EEOC, the Albemarle tests do not reasonably measure job performance. Because Albemarle has been revising their testing procedures throughout the appellate process, the Court left determining the appropriate relief to the lower court on remand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a concurring opinion where he argued that there was no legal bar to awarding backpay under Title VII of the Act, and only extremely unusual circumstances would prevent the awarding of backpay when liability has been established. He also argued that, although the backpay demand can be added to the action at any point, the district court can consider whether adding it later prejudiced Albemarle’s case in any way. In his concurring opinion, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that, in most cases, the awarding of backpay is at the discretion of the trial judge and should be governed by equity considerations. He also wrote that a lack of “bad faith” was not enough evidence to refuse to award backpay, though there are situations where the refusal would be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote an opinion concurring in judgment. He argued that an employer’s good faith was a relevant issue in a court’s discretionary decisions. He also argued that the Guidelines were theories regarding employment testing and its accuracy, and they should not be considered too rigidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He argued that, under the majority opinion’s standard, awarding backpay was unnecessary in this case, as Albemarle was already changing their policies. He also argued that the use of the EEOC Guidelines to determine whether the employment tests were constitutional was unreasonable because the Guidelines carry no legislative weight. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24252,"name":"Francis V.

If the sale did not go well, the four planned to attack the buyers and take the money. Agent Hall and Agent Lightcap posed as customers and the deal was in progress when they found themselves under attack. They countered the attack, and Feola, Alsondo, Rosa, and Farr were arrested for conspiracy to assault and assaulting federal agents in the commission of their duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial in the district court, the jury instructions specified that knowledge of the agents’ true identities was not a necessary element to prove the conspiracy charge. When the respondents appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction on the assault charges, but reversed the conviction on the conspiracy charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the knowledge that an intended assault victim is a federal agent an essential element in the crime of conspiracy to assault a federal officer?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that, given the legislative history of the statute, Congress clearly intended it to afford “maximum protection” to federal officers. This purpose was best satisfied with a looser understanding of intent. The Court held that this ruling was not unfair to the defendant because it did not make a previously legal action illegal. Intent to assault is criminal, regardless of the intended victim. The Court also held that the burden for proving conspiracy was not any higher than the burden for proving the element of the crime itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent where he argued that the precedent established by state laws makes the knowledge of an officer’s identity an essential element of the crime of assaulting one. Without such knowledge, the crime should be treated as an assault on a private citizen. He also argued that the statute’s specification regarding an assault on a federal agent during the “performance of his official duties” requires that the perpetrator be aware of the federal agent’s official status. Justice William O. Douglas joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17127,"name":"Allan A.

The police obtained the name of Richard Brown, who was identified as an acquaintance of the victim, though not a suspect. On May 13, 1968, detectives arrested Brown and searched his apartment without probable cause and without a warrant. The detectives read Brown his Miranda rights and proceeded to question him. During the questioning, Brown confessed to assisting in Corpus’ murder. Later, Brown was questioned again after being read his Miranda rights a second time. He substantially repeated his account of the murder. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to his trial, Brown moved to suppress the two statements based on the fact that his arrest was illegal and the statements were taken in violation of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The motion was denied and the case proceeded to trial. The jury found Brown guilty. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the judgment but did not accept the State’s argument that the arrest was legal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e Should inculpatory statements resulting from an illegal arrest but after the reading of Miranda rights be admissible in trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that Miranda warnings are not sufficient to remove the taint of an illegal arrest from statements made in custody. The Court held that the Fourth and Fifth Amendment were meant to work together, so that even if a statement is found to be voluntary as required by the Fifth Amendment, it could still be the result of an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment and therefore inadmissible. Because Brown’s arrest was illegal and the statements clearly stemmed from that arrest, the Court held that the statements were inadmissible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White concurred in the judgment and wrote that the Miranda warnings do not circumvent the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote an opinion concurring in part. He argued that the admissibility of Brown’s statements should be considered in the context of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. He also argued that the case should be remanded because the trial court made no determination regarding probable cause for the original arrest. Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the concurrence in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39583,"name":"Robert P.

Joseph Eszterhas, a reporter for the local newspaper the Plain Dealer, was assigned to cover the story. He decided to focus on the Melvin Cantrell’s funeral and the impact of his death on his family. Five months later, he returned to do a follow-up piece and spoke to the Cantrell children when their mother, Margaret Cantrell, was not present. The article appeared on August 4, 1968 and contained a number of admitted inaccuracies concerning the family and the status of their home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret Cantrell and her children sued under the “false light” theory of invasion of privacy. After the jury heard plaintiff’s case, the judge removed the demand for punitive damages because Cantrell had failed to present evidence that the falsehoods stemmed from actual malice. The defendants moved for a directed verdict, which the judge denied. The jury found the defendants guilty and awarded compensatory damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that the district judge should have granted the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the district judge have directed a verdict for Forest City Publishing Co.?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 8-1 majority. The Court held that the district judge adequately instructed the jury that liability could only be imposed if the jury determined that the false statements were made knowingly or with a reckless disregard for the truth. Because no one objected to the instructions, the Court held that it did not have to consider whether this was an acceptable standard for “false light” cases. The Court held that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in overturning the case. The Court of Appeals based its analysis on the concept of “actual malice” as defined in \u003ci\u003eNew York Times v. Sullivan\u003c/i\u003e, while the district judge based his analysis on the common law standard of malice. The Court held that the district judge should not have directed a verdict for Forest City Publishing Co. because there was sufficient evidence in the case to prove Forest City Publishing Co. was aware of the falsehoods. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent and argued that the imposition of legal analysis differentiating common law malice from actual malice infringes on the freedom of the press by making that freedom contingent upon a jury’s opinion. He argued that such a stance could result in a more timid press that would not report stories accurately for fear of facing a libel suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28015,"name":"Harry Alan Sherman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harry_alan_sherman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Sherman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"harry_alan_sherman"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9876"},{"advocate":{"ID":42302,"name":"Smith Warder","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/smith_warder","view_count":0,"last_name":"Warder","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"smith_warder"},"advocate_description":"for respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9877"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15847,"title":"Oral Argument - November 13, 1974","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15847"}],"citation":{"volume":"419","page":"245","year":"1974","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/15220"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15107,"name":"William O.

The order was issued without notice or a hearing.  If a railroad shipper held a car for longer than that time, they would lose the privilege to reconsign the contents of the car and were subject to a tariff from the point of origin to the holding point and from the holding point to the ultimate destination.  A three-judge district court held the ICC did not have the power to issue the order because it was not suspending any rule or regulation.  This case was heard on direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the ICC have the power to issue an order limiting the holding time for rail cars and imposing a tariff without notice?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote the unanimous opinion reversing the district court.  The Supreme Court held that the ICC did have the power to issue the order in an emergency and the order was in line with the ICC’s purpose.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that these discharges constituted unfair labor practices because the employee reasonably believed that disciplinary action would occur at the meeting.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the ruling was an impermissible departure from prior NLRB precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the discharges constitute an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.

The Department of Social Services stated that although those children would be eligible for benefits once born, while unborn they do not fit the Social Security Act’s definition of “dependent children” as required by the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.  The pregnant women sued, arguing that the denial of benefits conflicted with federal Social Security standards and violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The district court held that unborn children were “dependent children”, but did not reach the 14th Amendment arguments.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Do unborn children fall within the definition of “dependent children” under the Social Security Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the denial of welfare benefits for unborn children violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Undecided. In a 7-1 decision, Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that the legislative history surrounding the Social Security Act did not provide a basis for including unborn children in the definition of “dependent children”.  While some states had adopted welfare plans that included unborn children, it was not required in order to comply with federal law.  The Court also remanded the case for consideration of the Fourteenth Amendment issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent, stating that the legislative history is inconclusive.  Also, the long-standing administrative practice of providing unborn children with AFDC benefits when a state legislates for it prove that unborn children are included in the definition of “dependent children”.  Justice William O. Douglas did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40609,"name":"Richard C.

Twelve days later, he was admitted to Florida State Hospital and soon thereafter diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. The committing judge told Donaldson that he was being sent to the hospital for “a few weeks”. Instead, he was confined for almost fifteen years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Donaldson was admitted in 1957, J.B. O’Connor was Assistant Clinical Director of the hospital; O’Connor was also Donaldson’s attending physician until he transferred wards on April 18, 1967. John Gumanis was a staff physician for Donaldson’s ward. Donaldson was denied grounds privileges by Gumanis and confined to a locked building with sixty closely-quartered beds. As a Christian Scientist, Donaldson refused to take any medication or to submit to electroshock treatments. According to Donaldson, he received cognitive therapy from O’Connor no more than six times. In essence, the hospital provided Donaldson with subsistence-level custodial care, and a minimal amount of psychiatric treatment. Donaldson challenged his continued commitment several times, but each challenge was denied with little explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn February 1971, Donaldson charged O’Connor and other members of the hospital’s staff under § 1983 with intentionally and maliciously depriving him of his constitutional right to liberty. Evidence at trial showed that the staff had the power to release a mentally ill, committed patient if he was not dangerous to himself or others, but that the staff did not exercise this power. The jury trial found in favor of Donaldson, assessing both compensatory and punitive damages against O’Connor and Gumanis. O’Connor appealed his case separately, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirmed the jury’s verdict. The court rejected O’Connor’s argument that the trial court improperly barred the jury from finding that O’Connor acted in good faith. The jury instruction was valid because it explicitly stated that the defendants’ reasonable belief that Donaldson’s confinement was proper would preclude damages. Any reliance on state law would fall under this consideration of O\u0027Connor\u0027s good faith intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Fifth Circuit properly consider the trial court\u0027s failure to instruct the jury on O’Connor’s claimed reliance on state law? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision written by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court vacated the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. While the trial court properly instructed the jury on the relevance of O’Connor’s good faith intentions, Justice Stewart held that the Fifth Circuit must determine if the trial court properly instructed the jury on O’Connor’s reliance on state law. Justice Stewart acknowledged that the state cannot constitutionally confine a non-dangerous, mentally ill person capable of living outside of a mental health facility. He noted, however, that neither the trial court nor the Fifth Circuit acted with knowledge of the Court’s most recent decision on the scope of state officials’ qualified immunity, \u003ci\u003eWood v. Strickland\u003c/i\u003e. Under that decision, the relevant question for the jury was whether O’Connor knew his actions would deprive Donaldson of his constitutional rights, or whether he maliciously deprived him of his constitutional rights. The Court remanded the case back to the Fifth Circuit to be reconsidered with this test in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren Burger concurred. He argued that the Fifth Circuit should consider Donaldson’s consistent refusal of medical treatment to be taken into account in considering the respondent’s good faith defense. Chief Justice Burger also would have ordered the Fifth Circuit to consider the hospital staff’s potential reliance on Donaldson’s repeated unsuccessful attempts to seek release through the Florida court system.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39412,"name":"Raymond W.

Gurley added both federal and state excise taxes on to the retail price of the gasoline.  Mississippi imposed an additional 5% tax on the “gross proceeds” of all gas sales.  Mississippi did not permit Gurley to deduct the state and federal excise taxes from the “gross proceeds” before calculating the 5% tax.  Gurley paid the tax under protest, but sued for a refund.  They alleged that not allowing a pretax deduction of the excise taxes was an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth Amendment.  Gurley argued that the company was just a collector of taxes paid by the consumer, so those taxes were not actually part of his gross receipts.  The chancery court dismissed the suit and the Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Mississippi’s tax on the “gross proceeds”, including the amount collected to pay federal and state excise taxes, an unconstitutional taking?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice William J. Brennan wrote the unanimous opinion.  The Supreme Court held that the 5% tax is on Gurley, not the consumer.  Retailers traditionally pass the economic burden of taxes on to consumers, but that does not mean the legal responsibility for the tax has shifted.  Because the tax fell on Gurley, he was not unconstitutionally deprived of his property.  The court also held that the 5% tax did not violate equal protection because there was no claim of discriminatory enforcement.  Justice William O. Douglas did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18781,"name":"Charles R.

The Republic named “interventors” to take over and run the businesses.  The interventors continued to ship cigars to foreign purchasers, including in the U.S., and some purchasers mistakenly paid money owed to the original owners for cigars shipped before the takeover.  The interventors refused to return the money.  The original owners fled to New York and sued the purchasers for trademark infringement and compensation for money paid to the interventors for past shipments.  The district court held that the 1960 intervention was an “act of state” so U.S. courts had no power in the matter.  Under the act of state doctrine, the courts of a sovereign cannot question the acts of another sovereign within its own borders.  The court did, however, have power over the amounts mistakenly paid for pre-intervention shipments.  The purchasers were entitled to set off their mistaken payments against amounts due for post intervention shipments.  One purchaser, who was entitled to more than it owed, received an affirmative judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The court held that the 1960 act was an “act of state”, but also held that the interventor\u0027s refusal to pay back the mistaken payments was also an act of state.  The purchasers could still set off the amount they were entitled to against the amount they owed, but the court reversed the ruling for the one purchaser who received an affirmative judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the interventor’s refusal to return money mistakenly paid to them an act of state that cannot be questioned in U.S. courts?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice Byron R. White wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower judgment.  The Supreme Court held that the record contained no evidence to support an act of state.  There was no statute, decree or order by the Cuban Government refusing to pay, only a statement by the interventor’s counsel during trial.  The interventors did not possess governmental power just because the Cuban government appointed them.  The affirmative judgment for the one purchaser was restored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell wrote a concurrence, expressing that even in cases involving purely political matters, the courts must decide for themselves whether abstention is necessary, and it was not necessary in this case.  Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurrence, agreeing that the act of state doctrine did not bar the judgment in favor of the purchasers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent, stating that the interventor’s refusal to pay over the mistaken funds was an act of state regardless of the lack of an express decree by the Cuban government.  Justice William J. Brennan, Justice Potter Stewart, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43586,"name":"Victor S.

Whalen, a coastal tanker carrying fuel oil to New York from New Jersey, went astray. Unable to locate the breakwater light, her master attempted a U-turn, stranding her upon a sand bar. The light had failed. Its maintenance was the U.S. Coast Guard\u0027s responsibility. The tanker\u0027s owner sued in federal district court, which found negligence on the parts of both the vessel (75%) and the Coast Guard (25 %). Even though only the ship owner suffered damages, the district court applied the rule of divided damages, assessing both parties equal shares.

In 1967, he worked the first nine weeks of the year before being called for military service.  He served for 18 months before returning to Dravo to work the last 13 weeks of 1968.  Under his collective bargaining agreement, employees earn full vacation benefits if they work at least 25 weeks per year.  Under the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA), veterans returning to civilian jobs are entitled to their job at the same level of seniority, status and pay as when they left.  Foster did not receive vacation benefits for 1967 and 1968, so he sued in district court, arguing that he would have received those benefits had he worked for Dravo while he was in the military.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court ruled in favor of Dravo, holding that the vacation benefits did not accrue automatically with continued employment and so were not tied to seniority.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, but remanded the case to determine whether Foster should receive partial vacation benefits for the time he worked in 1967-68.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is Foster entitled to full vacation benefits upon his return from the military, even though he did not work the required weeks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) If not entitled to full benefits, is Foster entitled to partial benefits for the time he did work?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Maybe.  In a unanimous decision, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the majority opinion affirming the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that Foster was not entitled to full vacation benefits because the benefit did not accrue automatically as a result of continued employment.  The Court also held that the MSSA does not guarantee partial vacation benefits for time worked, but Foster’s collective bargaining agreement may.

The Tivoli was privately owned, but was leased to the city of Chattanooga. The city rejected Southeastern\u0027s request based on the controversial content in the production. Southeastern challenged the decision in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, alleging that Chattanooga\u0027s denial of its request violated the free speech clause of the First Amendment. The District Court ruled for Chattanooga and found that the musical contained obscene content that was not constitutionally protected. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed that decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Chattanooga\u0027s denial of Southeastern\u0027s request in violation of the free speech clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion, the Court reversed the Sixth Circuit and held that Chattanooga\u0027s denial of the Southeastern\u0027s request was a \"prior restraint,\" an attempt to censor speech and prevent it from reaching the public. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the majority, stated that though prior restraints were not necessarily unconstitutional, \"the risks of freewheeling censorship are formidable.\" Chattanooga\u0027s \"procedural safeguards were lacking\" in dealing with those risks and placed the burden on Southeastern to ensure that the musical could be produced. This was inconsistent with \u003cem\u003eFreedman v. Maryland\u003c/em\u003e, and therefore unconstitutional. Justice William O. Douglas dissented in part and concurred in the result in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27722,"name":"Henry P.
