When Kesler failed to pay the judgment for over sixty days, the judgment’s creditors, following Utah’s Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act (UMVSRA), filed the unpaid judgments with Utah’s Department of Public Safety. As a result, the Department suspended Kesler’s driver’s license and vehicle registration until he paid his judgment.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December, 1959 Kesler, who had still failed to pay the judgment, filed for bankruptcy in federal bankruptcy court. Although this released him from his judgment debts, the Department refused to restore his driver’s license and vehicle registration. The Department claimed that, under the UMVSRA, a bankruptcy proceeding will not release debts for negligently operating a motor vehicle.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States District Court for the District of Utah, affirmed the law and refused to both restore his license and to invalidate Utah’s law. A direct appeal to the United States’ Supreme Court followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Utah’s Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by overriding the federal Bankruptcy Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Felix Frankfurter, writing for the Court held that Utah’s law did not violate the Supremacy Clause. First, Justice Frankfurter noted that the states had compelling interests in promoting highway safety within their jurisdictions, citing to various measures taken to encourage safe driving throughout the United States. He also noted that most of these statutes did not allow drivers to discharge judgments against them for driving violations in bankruptcy. \u003cbr /\u003e Justice Frankfurter held that, although the Bankruptcy Act relieved an individual’s obligations to pay certain debts, it did not remove the negative consequences that a state may place on those debts. To that end, a state may decide that, in order to promote safe driving, a judgment must be paid before an individual may regain driving privileges.\u003cbr /\u003e Justice Potter Stewart concurred in part, but felt that the appeal was not properly before the Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren, in his dissenting opinion, argued that the initial three-judge panel at the District Court was improper and that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. Finally, Justice Hugo L. Black, in his dissenting opinion argued that Utah’s statute took away rights conferred to all United State’s citizens under the Bankruptcy Act and, therefore, violated the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23133,"name":"E.

This case concerns money orders between payors in Pennsylvania and payees in other states.  Over the years, Western Union accumulated a large sum of money from payees who never claimed the money sent to them.  Pennsylvania law states that when property goes unclaimed for seven years and the whereabouts of the owner are unknown, that property escheats to the state.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania started proceedings to escheat the unclaimed money.  Western Union argued that Pennsylvania provided insufficient service of process, and had no power to protect Western Union from other states who might attempt to escheat the same money.  The Court of Common Pleas ruled in favor of Pennsylvania and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does Pennsylvania have the authority to escheat unclaimed money from Western Union where the intended payees do not reside in Pennsylvania and other states may attempt to escheat the same money?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the service of process by publication violate due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No answer.  In a unanimous decision, Justice Hugo L. Black wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that the lower judgment violated due process because Pennsylvania had no power to protect Western Union from other states making similar claims over the same money.  In fact, the state of New York had already done just that.  The Court also held that the U.S. Supreme Court is authorized by Article 3, §2 of the Constitution to resolve dispute between states.  The Court stated that the service question was irrelevant because Pennsylvania didn’t have the power to enforce the judgment anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a concurrence, disagreeing with the Court’s reasoning, and stating the New York was clearly entitled to the property involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29085,"name":"John G.

He was tried and convicted in district court a year later, but he appealed his conviction based on information that corrupted the jury. A newspaper published an article regarding a witness who was too afraid of Coppedge to testify, which was information relayed to the judge while the jury was out of the room, and the jury should not have known. Coppedge petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for permission to appeal in forma pauperis, which would free him from the obligation to pay court costs. The Court of Appeals denied the petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit justified in dismissing the petition?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the 5-2 majority. The Court held that, since the Constitution guarantees the right to an appeal, the indigent petitioner must be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis if there is evidence of a legitimate issue to be considered on appeal. Additionally, the Court held that it is the responsibility of the legal system to ensure fair and speedy justice, which can often be difficult for poor defendants to access. Granting the in forma pauperis petition eliminates some of the hearings necessary for the case of a poor defendant to make it through the system and allows for increased efficiency. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that the American justice system considers criminal appeals to be a right, and therefore the in forma pauperis provisions are not meant to be an extra obstacle to the appeals process. He also argued that, at times, the arguments to determine whether an appeal is frivolous could lead courts to make a determination on the merits before the appropriate time, which truncated the appeals process. He suggested that petitions for in forma pauperis appeals be accepted “as a matter of course” to remove such confusion. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark wrote a dissent where he argued that the majority’s decision essentially overturned previous rulings by placing the burden on the government to prove the frivolity of the defendant’s appeal. He argued that the majority’s decision overstepped its bounds by remanding the case to the lower court, because the lower court had already found the case to be frivolous and dismissed the appeal. Justice John M. Harlan joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Byron R.

It also charged a 2% tax on goods bought in another state but used in the state.  This use tax was reduced by the amount of any use taxes paid in another state.  Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. shipped several cementing trucks to Louisiana.  On its tax return, Halliburton calculated the use tax using the value of the raw materials used in manufacturing the trucks.  Halliburton did not factor in the value of the labor required to manufacture the trucks.  Louisiana assessed a tax deficiency of $36,238.43 to take into account the value of the labor.  Halliburton paid the tax under protest and sued for a refund in the Louisiana District Court for the 19th District.   Halliburton argued that they would not pay taxes on labor if the trucks were manufactured in Louisiana, so the use tax unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The district court ruled in favor of Halliburton, but the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the tax discrepancy was only incidental.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Louisiana use tax violate the Commerce Clause as applied to Halliburton?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for a 7-2 majority, reversed the Louisiana Supreme Court.  Calculating the Louisiana use tax using labor costs creates an unequal tax burden on similarly situated in-state and out-of-state tax payers.  While the inequality may have been a mistake in drafting, it creates a substantial burden on taxpayers who manufacture goods out of state for use in Louisiana.  Justice William J. Brennan concurred, objecting to the use tax because of its discriminatory nature, not because it created unequal tax burdens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C.

Judge J. Warren Madden, an active judge on the Court of Claims at the time, granted the employees damages. Glidden argued that the guarantee in Article III of the Constitution that judges should hold their offices during good behavior meant that Judge Madden displayed a lack of appropriate judicial independence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrevious judicial precedent had established that the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the United States Court of Claims were neither confined in jurisdiction nor protected in independence by Article III of the Constitution, but that there were created by other powers Congress possessed under Article I. Congress had since enacted statutes explicitly including the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in Article III of the Constitution. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre judges in the United States Court of Claims and the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals constitutionally protected in tenure and compensation under Article III of the Constitution? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the 5-2 majority. The Court held that the judges, including retired judges, of the United States Court of Claims and the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals are constitutionally protected in tenure and compensation under Article III of the Constitution. Congressional declarations made it clear that those judges are protected under Article III, although such clarification was relatively recent. The Court held that it was not strictly bound to follow past precedent but was able to reconsider cases in which Congressional declarations have negated the previous holdings. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R.

Defendants alleged that their convictions were based upon no evidence of guilt and, therefore, denied them of due process of the law. Defendants were denied post-conviction relief in the state courts, and the Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCould the state criminally prosecute non-violent protestors staging a sit-in to express opposition to segregation by race? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, a state cannot apply its criminal statutes on disturbing the peace to non-violent protestors staging a sit-in to express opposition to segregation by race. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court held that the convictions violated defendants\u0027 rights to due process of law guaranteed them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court found no evidence that defendants\u0027 quiet, peaceable sitting at the counter that would have supported a finding that their conduct would have foreseeably disturbed the public. The Court acknowledged that the state courts might have construed the statute more broadly to permit a finding of imminent public commotion caused by peaceful and orderly conduct. Nonetheless, the Court found no evidence to support a finding of disturbing the peace. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas concurred on the ground that restaurants operating under a public license, though private enterprises, were public facilities in which a state may not constitutionally enforce a policy of racial segregation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter concurred in the judgment on the ground that the records in the present cases contained no evidence of disturbance or alarm in the behavior of the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan concurred in the judgment on the grounds that the defendants\u0027 conduct, insofar as it occurred with the implied consent of the management, was a form of expression within the range of protections afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment which could in no event be punished by the state under a general breach of the peace statute; and that, in any event, the Louisiana statute, as applied, was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30616,"name":"Jack Greenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_greenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_greenberg"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21814"},{"advocate":{"ID":33615,"name":"John F.

Martinez admitted that to avoid the draft, in 1942, he left the United States for Mexico and did not return until November, 1946. As a result of his deliberate absence, Martinez entered a guilty plea in 1947 to violating Section 11 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (the \"Act\") and served 366 days in prison. Five years after his release, Martinez was issued an arrest and deportation warrant premised on a violation of Section 401(j) of the Act which divested draft dodgers of their U.S. citizenship. Following a dismissal of his appeal from the Attorney General\u0027s special inquiry decision stripping him of his U.S. citizenship, Martinez challenged the constitutionality of Section 401(j) in District Court but was defeated. On appeal from the Ninth Circuit\u0027s opinion upholding the district court decision, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. This case was decided together with Rusk v. Cort.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Section 401(j) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, divesting U.S. citizens of their citizenship for remaining outside the United States during a time of war or national emergency in order to avoid the draft, violate the procedural safeguard of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court began by sustaining the validity of the Government\u0027s second action against Martinez since it addressed his lost of citizenship rather than revisiting his self-confessed draft evasion. The Court added, however, that although citizenship duties entail military service, the Government cannot divest citizens of their citizenship as a result of draft evasion alone. The imposition of such a drastic penalty, in the context of a reflexive statutory scheme, violates constitutional due process by denying subjects procedural safeguards such as the opportunity to experience a more incremental penal structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37425,"name":"Oscar H.

The federal government had not designated a reservation for the tribes.  The tribes depended on the salmon they trapped for survival and received permits to use the traps from the Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Forest Service, as well as favorable regulations from the Secretary of the Interior.  The president of the Kake Village Council was arrested while trying to moor a trap.  The tribes sued to enjoin Alaska from enforcing the anti-trapping law.  The district court dismissed the suit and the Supreme Court of Alaska affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the State of Alaska be enjoined from enforcing its own law, which conflicts with federally issued fishing permits?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 8-1 decision Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote for the majority affirming the Alaska court.  The Supreme Court held that there was no statutory authority granting the Secretary of the Interior the power to regulate contrary to state law.  In addition, the permits did not trump state law.  In order to prevent undue hardship, the Court ordered that the Native American tribes be allowed to continue using the traps through the end of the 1962 fishing season.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a partial dissent, agreeing that the Alaska law should prevail, but disagreeing with allowing the tribes to continue to use traps through the end of the 1962 season.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29728,"name":"John W.

Noting that women were \"still regarded as the center of home and family life,\" the Court found that the states could relieve them from the civic responsibility of jury duty unless they themselves determined that such service was consistent with their own \"special responsibilities.\" The Court held that the case was distinct from other cases involving racial discrimination in jury selection, and that male-female disproportions on jury lists carried no constitutional significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26936,"name":"Herbert B.

An ill or injured seaman is entitled to \"maintenance and cure,\" that is, to compensation by his employer for the expenses of his medical treatment and subsistence (i.e., room and board) while convalescing ashore. (Until 1982, a seaman could obtain free medical attention from the US Public Health Service. In such a case, the USPHS effectively relieved the seaman\u0027s employer of the duty of cure.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt discharge, after two voyages on \u003cem\u003eS.S. National Liberty\u003c/em\u003e, seaman Clifford Vaughan got a hospitalization certificate from the master, N.J. Atkinson. Vaughan then spent three months in a USPHS hospital and two years as an outpatient undergoing treatment for tuberculosis. The ship owner ignored Vaughan\u0027s request for maintenance as an outpatient. For a while before obtaining clearance to return to duty, Vaughan worked ashore as a cab driver. Later, he sued unsuccessfully in federal district court for maintenance and for damages from the ship owner\u0027s failure to promptly pay, including his attorney\u0027s fees. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did the district court err in offsetting Vaughan\u0027s possible recovery by the income earned as a cab driver?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Is the shipowner liable for attorney\u0027s fees?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. In a 5-2 opinion for the Court, Justice William O. Douglas held that allowing offset would encourage callous ship owners to refuse maintenance and cure. Moreover, courts in admiralty have adequate equity power to treat attorney\u0027s fees as damages from failure to pay maintenance (and cure) when it was a willful breach of duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart, joined by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, dissented. While there should be no \u003cem\u003eduty\u003c/em\u003e to mitigate, wages should be offset when actually earned. The duty to pay maintenance and cure was created to make the seaman whole, not afford him a windfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14795,"title":"Oral Argument - March 22, 1962","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14795"}],"citation":{"volume":"369","page":"527","year":"1962","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25053"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

A single public defender represented both defendants.  The public defender asked the trial court for a continuance because he was unprepared, there was a conflict of interest between the two defendants, and Douglas requested a new attorney.  The judge denied the request for a continuance. The defendants then requested that the public defender be removed from the case.  The judge granted that request but denied their request to appoint a new attorney.  The defendants completed the trial without any representation.  A jury found the defendants guilty of all thirteen felonies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe defendants appealed.  The Second District Court of Appeals for California’s Third District did not appoint counsel to represent the defendants, because, based on their review of the record, appointing counsel would add no benefit to the defendants’ case.  Following this decision, that court affirmed the trial court’s decision. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the trial court’s refusal to appoint new counsel violate the defendants’ equal protection rights? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, the trial court’s refusal violated the defendants’ equal protection rights.  Justice William Douglas delivered the opinion of a 6-3 majority.  The Court held that California’s treatment of defendants changed depending on whether the defendant could afford counsel.  Indigent defendants, potentially with “hidden merit” in their appeals, could not meaningfully appeal convictions when courts conducted reviews without input from the defendant’s attorney.  When indigent defendants, unable to afford attorneys, were forced to show preliminarily merit for their appeal before a court appoints counsel, they were denied due process.  Instead, California’s practice amounted to rich v. poor discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark dissented and argued that, because over 96% of prison appeals frivolously clog the court systems, California’s procedure balances defendants’ rights with state needs.  Justice John M. Harlan, joined by Justice Potter Stewart, wrote a separate dissent.  They argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, not the Equal Protection Clause, should have governed this issue.  Because California adequately balanced state and defendant rights, the state did not violate the Due Process Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36321,"name":"Marvin M.

The United States argued that the merger would substantially lessen competition in the shoe manufacturing and sales industries.  The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri ruled in favor of the United States.  The court ordered Brown to divest itself of all Kinney stock and assets and to operate Kinney as separately as possible pending complete divestiture.  The court gave Brown 90 days to come up with a plan for complete divestiture.  The case reached the Supreme Court on direct appeal under the Expediting Act, which allows direct appeal of final district court judgments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Brown/Kinney merger violate the Clayton Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the unanimous opinion of the court affirming the district court’s decision.  The Supreme Court held that the district court’s judgment was final, despite the pending plan for divestiture.  The Court also held that the district court\u0027s findings on the effect of the merger on competition were correct.  Justice Tom C. Harlan wrote a concurrence, stating that the effect of the merger was much broader than the district court found.  Justice John M. Harlan dissented in part, concurring in the judgment, but finding that the district court’s judgment was not final, so direct appeal was not proper.  Justices Byron R. White and Felix Frankfurter did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15799,"name":"Arthur H.

The regulations under the Act require sellers to identify type 14 tobacco with a blue tag.  The Georgia Tobacco Identification Act requires sellers to mark the same type of tobacco with a white tag.  Several owners and operators of tobacco warehouses in Georgia sued in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to enjoin enforcement of the Georgia law.  The three judge court granted the injunction.  The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the identification provision in the Georgia Tobacco Identification Act precluded by the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 6-3 decision, Justice William O. Douglas wrote the majority opinion affirming the lower court.  The Court held that Congress had the power to regulate tobacco sales through the Commerce Clause.  By enacting the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act, Congress preempted the states from regulating in that area of commerce, so the identification provision of the Georgia Tobacco Identification Act is invalid.  Justice Hugo L. Black dissented, writing that Congress did not intend to preclude this area of regulation with the Federal Tobacco Inspection Act.  The Georgia statute was valid because it did not conflict with the federal act.  Justice Felix Frankfurter and Justice John M. Harlan joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25492,"name":"G.

After six years of motions, a pretrial hearing was set for October 12, 1960. On October 11, 1960, Link’s attorney contacted the Wabash Railroad attorney to inform him that he was doing work in Indianapolis and would miss a deposition that was set to happen before the hearing. The next morning, Link’s lawyer called the courthouse to notify the judge that he was detained in Indianapolis filing papers for a case before the Iowa Supreme Court. He said he could not make it to court that day but was available both of the next two days. Two hours after the pretrial was supposed to start, the court found that Link’s lawyer had not provided a sufficient reason for missing the hearing and dismissed the case “for failure to prosecute the action.” The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a court dismiss a case for failure to prosecute without a motion from the defendant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John M. Harlan delivered the decision of the 4-3 majority. The Court held that a court has the right to clear its calendar of cases that have been dormant because of inaction on the part of the plaintiff without any motion from the defense. This right has long been understood as one of the inherent powers of the court and no law explicitly restricts it. The Court also held that there are circumstances where a lack of a chance for argument does not violate the right to due process. In this case, the plaintiff voluntarily chose a lawyer with potential time conflicts, and both sides had plenty of notice about the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent where he argued that the majority’s decision essentially punished the plaintiff by forcing him to accept the loss of his property without due process. He found that the court’s decision relied solely on the lawyer’s failure to appear, rather than any other want of prosecution in the history of the case. Instead, the lawyer’s attempts to contact the court and reschedule the hearing clearly indicated a desire to continue the prosecution of the case. He also argued that to punish the client for the sins of the lawyer placed an enormous and unfair burden on the client to oversee the work of his attorney. Chief Justice Earl Warren joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas also dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Byron R.

Each company sold dairy products to retail stores under a plan that gave independent stores discounts on the list prices based on the volume of the independent stores\u0027 purchases, up to a specified maximum discount. The dairies granted grocery chain stores a flat discount, without reference to the volume of their purchases, at a rate substantially higher than the maximum discount available to independent grocery stores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government brought a Section 2(a) Clayton Act suit against The Borden Company and Bowman Dairy Company, seeking an injunction against selling milk products at prices which discriminated between the independent groceries and the chain groceries. Each company conducted its own cost study in an attempt to demonstrate that the differences in pricing between independent groceries and chain groceries were due to actual cost differences. The cost studies demonstrated that it was less costly on average to sell to chain stores. So, the dairy companies argued that the price discrimination was justified by the cost justification proviso of the Clayton Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the Government\u0027s suit, concluding that the cost differences demonstrated by the two companies\u0027 cost studies were sufficient to justify the price discrimination. The United States appealed the District Court\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the Clayton Act, is it lawful to engage in price discrimination in favor of chain groceries and against independent groceries with a showing that sales to chains are less costly on average than sales to independents, but without showing why chains and independents should be treated as separate classes of purchasers?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Justice Tom C. Clark, wrote the opinion of the Court reversing and remanding the lower court\u0027s decision. Writing for himself and five other justices, Clark maintained that the cost studies submitted by the two dairy companies did not satisfy their burden of showing that their respective discriminatory pricing plans reflected only a due allowance for cost differences. Clark recognized that eliminating class pricing would be impractical, but emphasized that customer classifications could not be arbitrary and that members of a class must have such similarity as to make the averaging of the cost of dealing with the class a valid and reasonable indication of the cost of dealing with any specific member of the class. Since Borden and Bowman did not show sufficient homogeneity within the class of chain groceries or within the class of independent groceries, the price discrimination between the two classes was illegal under the Clayton Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas voted with the majority and wrote a concurring opinion, which emphasized the purpose of the anti-trust acts. Douglas stated that the Clayton Act should be read in a way that preserves as much of traditional free enterprise as possible, by controlling practices such as unfair discounting, which could lead to unfair competitive advantage and monopoly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Marshall Harlan dissented. Harlan stated that the cost studies submitted to the district court were adequate under the accepted principles of the law in this field. He agreed with the District Court\u0027s conclusion that the studies were conscientiously prepared and appeared to justify the price discrimination arising from the discount practices. As such, Harlan would have affirmed the lower court\u0027s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter took no part in this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14029,"title":"Oral Argument - April 24, 1962","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14029"},{"id":14279,"title":"Oral Argument - April 25, 1962 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14279"},{"id":14436,"title":"Oral Argument - April 25, 1962 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14436"}],"citation":{"volume":"370","page":"460","year":"1962","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25078"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Hutcheson, a president of a labor union, refused to answer eighteen questions before the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field. Although Hutcheson appeared to be concerned about the state using his words against him in a pending state criminal trial, he specifically waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Instead, he argued that the Committee only wanted to expose his wrongful acts, and that this exposure would violate his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the Committee\u0027s questions acted as a \"pretrial\" of the state charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States District Court for the District of Columbia found the union president guilty of contempt of Congress. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the judgment.

Harlan wrote for the majority and concluded that the Committee\u0027s questions were not outside the scope of the Senate investigation, nor were the Committee\u0027s questions asked simply to expose the union president\u0027s criminal acts. The fact that state prosecutors could have used the answers to the questions in a pending state criminal trial did not violate Due Process. The Court did not allow the union president to attempt to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because he had explicitly waived it in the Committee hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Earl Warren wrote a dissent stating that the opinion forced the union president to choose between invoking the privilege against self-incrimination, answering the questions truthfully and aiding state prosecutors, committing perjury, or refusing to answer and face contempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14442,"title":"Oral Argument - November 06, 1961","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14442"}],"citation":{"volume":"369","page":"599","year":"1962","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25083"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15099,"name":"Earl Warren","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/earl_warren","view_count":0,"last_name":"Warren","roles":[{"id":2743,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-512503200,"date_end":-16570800,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

A group of organizations joined forces in challenging the prayer, claiming that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The New York Court of Appeals rejected their arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the reading of a nondenominational prayer at the start of the school day violate the \"establishment of religion\" clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe state cannot hold prayers in public schools, even if participation is not required and the prayer is not tied to a particular religion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Hugo L. Black, the Court held that respondent\u0027s decision to use its school system to facilitate recitation of the official prayer violated the Establishment Clause. Specifically, the policy breached the constitutional wall of separation between church and state. The Court ruled that the constitutional prohibition of laws establishing religion meant that government had no business drafting formal prayers for any segment of its population to repeat in a government-sponsored religious program.

The Court likened the law to one making it a criminal offense \"to be mentally ill, or a leper, or to be afflicted with a venereal disease,\" and argued that the state could not punish persons merely because of their \"status\" of addiction. The Court noted that the law was not aimed at the purchase, sale, or possession of illegal drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile joining the Court\u0027s opinion, Justice Douglas, in a separate opinion, elaborated the reasons why the statute was regarded as imposing a cruel and unusual punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan concurred on the ground that the trial court\u0027s instruction permitted the jury to find defendant guilty on no more proof than that he was present in California while he was addicted to narcotics, and hence authorized punishment for a bare desire to commit a criminal act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clark dissented, primarily on the ground that, properly construed, the statute provided a treatment rather than a punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice White also dissented, expressing the view that it was within the power of the state to confine the defendant by criminal proceedings for the use of narcotics or for regular use amounting to habitual use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14428,"title":"Oral Argument - April 17, 1962","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14428"}],"citation":{"volume":"370","page":"660","year":"1962","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25102"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Hodges on charges of armed robbery. On May 2, 1956, two members of the District of Columbia Police Department traveled to Chicago and interrogated Hodges for about an hour before producing a written statement. Hodges was returned to Washington, D.C., indicted, and pled guilty. Hodges later withdrew his plea and entered a plea of not guilty. On April 15, 1957, Hodges went to trial and was found guilty. He did not appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree months later, Hodges filed a motion in district court to vacate his sentence, arguing that his confession was coerced and should not have been admitted into evidence at trial. The motion was denied without a hearing. Hodges appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the district court have given Hodges a hearing on his motion to vacate after his period to appeal expired?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a per curiam opinion, the Court determined that the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted. The Court held that the district court was not required to hold a hearing because Hodges was not entitled to relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O.

Board of Education, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) received much criticism from state legislators as it pushed ahead with litigation to combat segregation. The State of Florida, in 1959, established a Legislative Investigation Committee to study what were called \"subversive organizations.\" Gibson, president of the Miami branch of the NAACP, was subpoenaed before the committee and asked to produce a membership list of his organization. He refused and was found in contempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Florida Committee, in attempting to inform itself about activities of subversive organizations, violate Gibson\u0027s right to free speech and association as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a close decision, the Court found that Gibson\u0027s rights had been violated. In his opinion, Justice Goldberg recognized the important right of states to inform themselves on \"legitimate and vital interests.\" However, even though inquiring about the actions of a group such as the Communist Party may have been one of these legitimate interests, argued Goldberg, Florida did not prove that a \"substantial connection\" between the Miami NAACP and Communist Party activities existed. Thus, a \"compelling and subordinating governmental interest\" would not have been served by forcing Gibson to disclose his group\u0027s membership list.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38936,"name":"Robert L.

The group allegedly falsified tests on goods manufactured at Standard Oil’s plant.  Before the government finished presenting their case, the district court judge directed the jury to return verdicts of acquittal for all parties on all counts.  He then entered formal judgments of acquittal on the grounds of improper conduct by the Assistant U.S. States Attorney and a lack of credibility in the testimony of government witnesses.  The United States filed for a writ of mandamus from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, asking the court of vacate the judgments and order a new trial.  The court granted the writ, holding that the district court did not have the power to direct the judgment of acquittal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the district court judge have the power to order acquittal before the prosecution rested its case?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment protect the petitioners from a second trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, Yes. In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals.  The Court held that vacating the acquittal and granting a new trial violated petitioners’ constitutional protection against double jeopardy.  Justice John M. Harlan concurred, agreeing that double jeopardy barred a second trial, because the trial court did not base its decision solely on the Assistant U.S. Attorney’s misconduct.  Justice Tom C. Clark dissented, arguing that the district court had no power to direct a verdict of acquittal.  Justice Charles E.

From October of 1952 to February 28, 1953, Killian served as an officer of Local 1111. On December 9, 1952, the president of Local 1111 ordered all officers to come to the union office to execute affidavits stating that they were not members of the Communist Party, in accordance with the Taft-Hartley Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs early as the fall of 1949, Killian was a member of the Communist party group on the campus of the University of Wisconsin and in the city of Madison, Wisconsin. Killian held a number of the group’s meetings in his home. Government witness Sullivan transferred his Communist Party membership to Madison in October 1949; Killian contacted him in his role assigning individuals to Communist Party groups or cells. In November of 1951, Killian and others formed a Communist Party cell to operate within the Allen-Bradley plant. Killian suggested to a government witness and co-worker, Ondrejka, that both should become stewards of Local 1111 to advance party aims within the union; both subsequently became officers and participated in union meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKillian was charged with making false statements in an affidavit. At trial, both Sullivan and Onrejka testified that they joined the Communist Party at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On cross-examination, Sullivan and Ondrejka testified that the FBI paid them monthly amounts for their services, and were reimbursed for expenses incurred in Communist Party activities. Killian moved for production of all statements given by Sullivan and Ondrejka to the FBI, with a particular focus on reports made by Ondrejka of his reimbursable expenses and receipts signed by Ondrejka; Killian requested this evidence to impeach the witnesses’ testimony. Killian also moved to strike both Sullivan and Ondrejka’s testimony. The government instead offered to produce a list showing the dates and amounts of payments to Ondrejka and whether each payment was for services or expenses. Killian refused this substituted evidence, and the district court denied Killian’s motions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld Killian\u0027s conviction, holding that the district judge properly excluded the requested reports and receipts because they were not related to the direct testimony of the witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Was the prosecution properly excused from producing statements and documents that reported payments to prosecution witnesses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the jury instructions properly define membership in the Communist Party?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(3) Did the jury instructions properly define “affiliation”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes, and yes. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Charles E. Whittaker, the Court held that the district court must determine whether the documents requested by Killian were destroyed in good faith and in accord with normal practice, as suggested by the United States. If so, Killian would not be entitled to a new trial, because this would suggest that the information contained on the receipts was finally recorded elsewhere and already in evidence. The United States claimed that only two of Ondrejka’s receipts related to his testimony and that this information was contained in Ondrejka’s narrative statements; Justice Whittaker instructed the district court to make a final judgment for the government if it finds that this claim was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Whittaker rejected Killian’s objection to the jury instruction’s subjective definition of membership in the Communist Party. He reasoned that the very nature of claimed membership in a secret or underground organization precludes the existence of objective proof of membership. Justice Whittaker also rejected Killian’s argument that the Communist Control Act (CCA) -- from which the jury instructions were largely drawn -- was unconstitutional. He noted that Killian was charged with lying about being a Communist in an affidavit, not with being a member of the Communist Party, the status prohibited by the CCA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Whittaker held that the district court properly defined “affiliation” for its jury instruction. He cited several decisions in the circuit courts using similar definitions of \"affiliation\" with the Communist Party. He rejected Killian’s narrow definition of “affiliation”, wherein the government would have to show that Killian was a member of an organization working with the Communist Party. He held that the district court’s definition was reasonable and properly outlined, vacating the judgment and remanding the case to the district court. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo Black dissented. He argued that compelling union officers to swear they are not Communists violated the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of belief and political association. He noted that test oaths are historic weapons against religious and political minority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Black. Justice Douglas argued that the jury could find Killian guilty only if he committed illegal acts in connection with his role in the Communist Party. As the record contained no evidence of Killian committing an illegal act, his conviction should have been reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan dissented. He took issue with the majority’s interpretation of “membership”, and would have required evidence of some objective act of association and admission, understood as such by the party and by Killian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21413,"name":"David B.

During excavation, water filled the crater, which widened and deepened. The town expanded around the excavation and later enacted a series of ordinances to regulate mining excavation within its limits. In 1958, the town amended an ordinance to prohibit excavation below the water table and impose a duty refill any excavation currently below the level. In 1959, the town sued Goldblatt for not complying with the ordinance. Goldblatt argued the ordinance is unconstitutional because it was not regulatory but rather represented the town confiscating his property without compensation. The Court of Appeals of New York held for the Town of Hempstead, allowing them to enforce the prohibition and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo regulatory ordinances that result in taking land that was previously used for purposes of profit violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Thomas C. Clark delivered the opinion of the 7-0 majority. The court held that regulation ordinances that take property previously used for personal profit are constitutional if the regulations are reasonable within due process of the law. The ordinance in this case was a valid exercise of the town’s police powers since it was passed as a safety measure to protect the general public of the town; therefore, the regulations are reasonable and do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Byron R.

The provisions in question required those who buy milk elsewhere and bring it into the region to pay the farmers who supply that region a “compensatory payment.” The petitioners were milk processing plant operators in Pennsylvania who challenged the validity of the “compensatory payment” provisions by arguing that they failed notice requirements and conflicted with other provisions of the Act that required uniform prices. The district court held these provisions to be invalid, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and upheld the validity of the provisions as authorized by the Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWere the “compensatory payment” provisions that the Secretary of Agriculture enacted valid under the Agricultural Market Agreement Act of 1937?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe compensatory payment provisions were invalid as inconsistent with Congress’ intent in enacting the Agricultural Market Agreement Act of 1937. Justice John M. Harlan, II delivered the opinion of the 6-1 majority. The Court held the Secretary of Agriculture exceeded his authority by creating the “compensatory payment” provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937. The provisions essentially forced non-regional milk producers to subsidize regional milk producers, which interfered with the competitive advantage the the cheaper, non-regional milk producers would naturally have. The legislative history of the Act indicates that Congress intended it to prevent this type of creation of economic barriers to protect the prices of regional products. Therefore, the provisions conflicted with Congress’ intent and were invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Court should have affirmed the lower court’s decision upholding the Secretary of Agriculture. Black explained that the Secretary did not overreach, and he should be given the authority to impose the provisions at issue in order to protect farmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44412,"name":"Willis F.

Since 1915, the Secretary of the Interior has permitted the Metlakatla Indians to use commercial salmon fishing traps. In 1959, the Alaskan State Legislature abolished all commercial traps used for salmon fishing in order the prevent overfishing. The state warned the Metlakatla Indians that the statute would be enforced against them, and officers arrested some members of the community and seized one fish trap. The Metlakatla Indians sued the state in district court and sought an injunction against further interference. The district court dismissed the case. The appeal went directly to the Supreme Court, as the Supreme Court of Alaska had not yet been organized. The Supreme Court granted a stay until the case could be considered by the Supreme Court of Alaska, which eventually affirmed the district court’s dismissal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan state statutes be enforced on Indian reservations that have been granted federal authorization to pursue an activity the state has made illegal?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Felix Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that the Annette Islands were turned into a reservation for the Metlakatla Indians specifically to protect them from outside intrusion or exploitation. The proclamation that established the reservation also gave the Secretary of the Interior authority to prescribe rules governing fishing and other activities on the islands. The Court held that the state statute transfers neither the authority of the Indian community nor that of the Secretary of the Interior to the state. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40513,"name":"Richard Schifter","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/richard_schifter","view_count":0,"last_name":"Schifter","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"richard_schifter"},"advocate_description":"for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21801"},{"advocate":{"ID":39849,"name":"Ralph E.
