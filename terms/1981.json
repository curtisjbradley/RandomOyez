When the plane crashed, killing all on board, the next of kin, also Scottish, had a Los Angeles-based lawyer sue Piper and Hartzell for wrongful death. The suit was filed in a California state court, then removed to Federal District Court in California, and finally transferred to Federal District Court in Pennsylvania. There it was dismissed for \u003cem\u003eforum non conveniens\u003c/em\u003e under the determination that the case should be tried in Scotland: the crash had occurred, the crash investigation had been conducted there by British authorities, and the pilot\u0027s estate, the plane\u0027s owners, and the charter company were all located there. However, respondents successfully appealed, claiming that substantive law in Scotland would be unfavorable to their case. Scotland, unlike Pennsylvania, had no strict liability law, which, along with negligence, respondents were relying upon in order to prevail.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the possibility of an unfavorable change in law bar dismissal under \u003cem\u003eforum non conveniens\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 4-3 majority opinion authored by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court held that the District Court properly weighed private and public interests using the \u003cem\u003eGulf Oil v.

The officer asked for identification. The student, accompanied by the officer, then went into his dormitory to retrieve proof of age. After the student had entered his room, the officer noticed that the student\u0027s roommate, Chrisman, had marijuana seeds and a pipe on his desk. Chrisman was subsequently charged with the possession of marijuana and LSD.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the officer\u0027s seizure of the drugs violate Chrisman\u0027s \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that the \"plain view\" exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement permitted law enforcement officers to seize clearly incriminating evidence discovered \"in a place where the officer has a right to be.\" The Court held that the officer had a right to remain at the initial suspect\u0027s elbow at all times, and did not waive his right to custodial control because he hesitated briefly in the doorway of the dormitory room before entering. In short, the officer had obtained lawful access to an individual\u0027s area of privacy and was free to seize incriminating evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38997,"name":"Ronald R.

Vieques’ population of 8,000 mostly lived in two coastal towns and in a rural area outside of those two towns. Of a total area of approximately 33,000 acres, the United States Navy owned 25,231.72 acres, slightly more than 76% of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Navy’s installations on the eastern part of Vieques were part of a large military complex known as the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility, headquartered at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. This consisted of four firing ranges; the outer range was a large area of ocean thirty-five miles to the north and twenty miles to the south of Vieques. Two separate inland areas were used for artillery training, strafing, air-to-ground bombing, and simulating close air support; no targets existed in the area between the eastern border of these areas and Punta Este, the easternmost point of Vieques. During air-to-ground training, however, pilots sometimes accidentally discharged ordnance into the navigable waters around Viques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos Romero-Barceleo was the governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Along with Radamees Tirado Guevara, the mayor of Vieques, and Puerto Rico’s Environmental Quality Board, Romero-Barceleo sought to enjoin the United States Navy from using any part of its lands in Vieques, or in its surrounding waters, to carry out naval training operations. Plaintiffs alleged harm to all residents of Vieques and violations of numerous environmental laws, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA). Under the FWPCA, the addition of any pollutant from any point source into the navigable waters of the United States required a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the Environmental Protection Agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court acknowledged that the release of ordnance into navigable waters was a discharge of pollutants, but it refused to enjoin Navy operations, instead ordering the Navy to apply for an NPDES permit. The United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit, reversed. It ordered the Navy to cease operations until it obtained an NPDES permit. It held that the Navy has an absolute statutory obligation to stop any discharges of pollutants until it obtains a permit despite the importance of its operations to the public good.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Federal Water Pollution Control Act require the district court to issue an injunction prohibiting the United States Navy from discharging ordnance into the water surrounding Vieques Island?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron White, writing for the Court in an 8-1 decision, held that the district court was not obligated to enjoin the Navy from operating on and around Vieques island. He emphasized the traditional flexibility of equitable remedies and courts’ responsibility to balance plaintiffs’ need for an injunction with the public utility of the enjoined action. He acknowledged that Congress may control the exercise of courts’ discretion by statute, but distinguished the case from \u003ci\u003eTVA v. Hill\u003c/i\u003e, where the Court held that the completion of a dam would violate explicit provisions of the Endangered Species Act. Here, an injunction is not the only means of ensuring compliance, as the FWPCA provides remedies in the form of fines and criminal penalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice White also looked to the legislative history of the FWPCA, determining that Congress did not intend to take away courts’ discretion in issuing injunctions. He also noted that the district court did not find that the Navy’s operations negatively impacted Vieques’ water quality; hence, requiring the Navy to obtain a permit while continuing its operations would meet the FWPCA’s goal of controlling water pollution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell concurred. He agreed that Congress did not intend to take away courts\u0027 discretion in ordering injunctions, but would have remanded the case to the First Circuit with instructions to affirm the district court’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented. He also agreed that the FWPCA does not specifically command courts to issue an injunction for every unpermitted discharge of a pollutant, but he rejected the Court’s characterization of the First Circuit’s opinion. He argued instead that the First Circuit rightly gave weight to the FWPCA’s permitting structure given the Navy’s ongoing violation of the act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23149,"name":"Elinor Hadley Stillman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/elinor_h_stillman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stillman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"elinor_h_stillman"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12125"},{"advocate":{"ID":30757,"name":"John A.

The Illinois Business Take-Over Act requires a tender offeror to notify the Secretary of State and the target company of its intent to make a tender offer and the terms of the offer 20 days before the offer becomes effective. During that time, the target company, but not the offeror, is free to disseminate information about the offer to the target company\u0027s shareholders. In addition, the Secretary of State could call a hearing, and the offer could not proceed until the hearing was completed. Finally, the Secretary of State could deny registration of a takeover offer he or she found inequitable. MITE Corp. sought and won a declaratory judgment holding that the Illinois Act was pre-empted by the Williams Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 78m(d)-(e) and 78n(d)-(f), and that it violated the Commerce Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Illinois Business Take-Over Act unconstitutional under the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses of the U.S. Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, with regard to the Commerce Clause. The Illinois Act imposes burdens on interstate commerce that are excessive in light of the local interests the Act purports to further. Among the ways a corporation can be covered by the Act is if 10% of the class of equity securities subject to the offer is owned by shareholders located in Illinois. Thus Illinois would have the power to determine whether a tender offer may proceed even if made for a corporation incorporated and having a principal place of business outside of Illinois, with up to 90% of the shareholders residing outside of Illinois. Illinois\u0027s asserted interest in protecting resident security holders is insufficient to outweigh the burdens Illinois would impose on interstate commerce. In addition, Illinois\u0027s asserted interest in regulating the internal affairs of a corporation incorporated under its laws not only fails to justify the Act\u0027s coverage of foreign corporations, but transfers of stock to a third party do not implicate the internal affairs of a corporation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21994,"name":"Eugene D.

Edmondson issued a suit against him in a Virginia state court for failing to repay his debt. Before the court reached a decision, it issued a \"writ of attachment\" against Lugar. This disabled him from selling any property he owned while the case was open, since Edmondson wanted the property as collateral in case he could not repay his debt. A state trial judge cancelled the \"writ of attachment\" one month later after finding no statutory justification for its issuance. Lugar claimed that Edmondson worked with the government to deprive him of his property without the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He said this caused him financial loss and sought to recover damages from Edmondson in a District Court under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. This code provides rewards to those who have had their rights violated because of \"state action.\" The District Court rejected Lugar\u0027s claim because it deemed that no \"state action\" had occurred. On review, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected using solely \"state action\" to validate Section 1983 suits. It claimed that certain instances where private parties acted \"under the color of state law\" also validated Section 1983 suits. However the Fourth Circuit found that none of these actions occurred in Lugar\u0027s case and rejected his suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo \"state actions\" that occur indirectly \"under the color of state law\" and violate an individual\u0027s Fourteenth Amendment rights validate damage recovery suits filed under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for a 5-4 court. The Fourteenth Amendment prevents \"state actions\" from intruding unlawfully upon the rights of citizens. Section 1983 offers relief to those who have their rights unlawfully abridged by actions occurring \"under the color of state law.\" The Court decided that a state was liable for damages caused by unconstitutional conduct when two conditions were met. First, \"the deprivation [of a constitutional right] must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State.\" Second, \"the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\" This includes both state officials and those whom are significantly aided by them. The Court previously found that the states guaranteed the due process of law when placing holds on disputed pieces of property, and therefore they are responsible for violations of this process. Accordingly, when Edmondson used state mechanisms to unconstitutionally deprive Lugar of his property, the state was responsible for compensating him for damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40024,"name":"Robert L.

In support of its actions, the Board said such books were: \"anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy.\" Acting through his friend Francis Pico, and on behalf of several other students, Steven Pico brought suit in federal district court challenging the Board\u0027s decision to remove the books. The Board won; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. The Board petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Board of Education\u0027s decision to ban certain books from its junior high and high school libraries, based on their content, violate the First Amendment\u0027s freedom of speech protections?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Although school boards have a vested interest in promoting respect for social, moral, and political community values, their discretionary power is secondary to the transcendent imperatives of the First Amendment. The Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, held that as centers for voluntary inquiry and the dissemination of information and ideas, school libraries enjoy a special affinity with the rights of free speech and press. Therefore, the Board could not restrict the availability of books in its libraries simply because its members disagreed with their idea content.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25660,"name":"George W.

No court or administrative body found the district to be engaged in unlawful segregation. A statewide initiative adopted in 1978 mandated a neighborhood school policy. The policy provided for some exceptions including voluntary busing options and mandatory busing if so ordered by state or federal courts. The initiative blocked the implementation of Seattle\u0027s mandatory busing plan.

Before leaving, Eddings took three of his father’s firearms, including a .410 gauge shotgun with a shortened barrel. Before reaching the Turner Turnpike near Tulsa, the group stopped at a Howard Johnson restaurant. As they were leaving, Eddings lost control of the car, briefly sending it over a curb and into a ditch before regaining control. A witness observed this and informed an officer of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Patrolman Larry Crabtree, who followed their car and pulled it over. When Crabtree was within about six feet of the car, Eddings stuck the shotgun out of the window and fired it, killing Crabtree, then immediately drove the car away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, the defense presented evidence of circumstances mitigating Eddings’ guilt, including the details of his extensive juvenile record in Missouri. Eddings’ parents divorced when he was five, after which he was shuffled between his mother’s house and his father’s house and also spent some time in a group home. Witnesses testified that Eddings was emotionally disturbed and at a level several years below his age in terms of mental and emotional development. A state psychologist testified that Eddings had a sociopathic or antisocial personality disorder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state provided evidence of aggravating circumstances. Oklahoma alleged 1) that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, 2) that the crime was committed to avoid a lawful arrest, and 3) that there was a probability that the defendant would commit more criminal acts of violence constituting a threat to society. The trial judge found that the state proved all three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge also found that Eddings’ age was a mitigating factor of great weight, but would not consider evidence of Eddings’ “violent background.” The judge then found that the aggravating circumstances proven by the state outweighed the fact of Eddings’ age and sentenced him to death. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma affirmed the sentence, also holding that Eddings\u0027 death penalty sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the trial court commit a plain error when it failed to consider evidence of Eddings’ unhappy childhood and emotional disturbance in its consideration of mitigating and aggravating circumstances?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 opinion written by Justice Louis Powell, the Court held that the trial court erred when it failed to consider mitigating evidence of Eddings’ unhappy childhood and emotional disturbance. Justice Powell looked to the Court’s decision in \u003ci\u003eLockett v. Ohio\u003c/i\u003e, where it held that a sentencer must consider any relevant aspect of a defendant’s character or record as mitigating factors toward imposing a sentence less than death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Powell then determined that the trial judge refused to consider the mitigating evidence of Eddings’ family history as a matter of law, rather than finding that evidence wanting as a matter of fact. He also determined that the court of appeals limited the evidence of mitigating circumstances to the fact of Eddings’ youth. He emphasized that the undisputed evidence of Eddings’ violent background demonstrated that he was not a normal sixteen-year-old. Justice Powell held that the Oklahoma state courts must consider such evidence when imposing the death penalty, reversing the sentence and remanding the case for further proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Brennan concurred, repeating his view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor concurred, agreeing that the trial court incorrectly determined that it could not consider evidence of Eddings’ violent background as a matter of law. She emphasized that the majority’s holding did not change the Court’s opinions establishing the constitutionality of the death penalty; nor did it determine whether the Constitution permits the imposition of the death penalty on a sixteen-year-old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren Burger dissented, joined by Justices Byron White, Harry Blackmun, and William Rehnquist. He pointed out that the Court granted certiorari to answer whether it was constitutional to impose the death penalty on a sixteen-year-old offender, and that Eddings raised the evidentiary question for the first time in his brief to the Court. He argued that both the trial judge and the court of appeals actually weighed the evidence of Eddings’ violent background and found it lacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29264,"name":"Jay C.

The Court held that there was extensive historical evidence that the county had impeded the political participation of black citizens and that the at-large system minimized even further the ability of blacks to participate in the political process.

(\"Treasure\") located a 17th-century Spanish wreck of its coast, Florida claimed ownership of the remains. Treasure contracted with the Florida Division of Archives (\"Archives\") to salvage the wreck in exchange for 75% of the recovered artifacts\u0027 appraised value. Meanwhile, in the unrelated proceedings of United States v. Florida, the United States won a judgment granting it ownership of the lands, minerals, and other natural resources in the area of the Spanish wreck\u0027s discovery. Upon learning of this ruling, Treasure sought a declaration of title to the wreck. Following a second favorable appellate decision, Treasure sought and received a warrant to seize all artifacts from the Archives. Florida challenged the warrant and its issuing district court\u0027s jurisdiction, but lost on both counts. On appeal from an unfavorable appellate ruling, the Supreme Court granted Florida certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a district court\u0027s issuance of a property seizure warrant against a state violate the Eleventh Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a plurality opinion, the Court first held that while a state enjoys limited immunity from federal process under the Eleventh Amendment, its officers do not. In the present case, the seizure warrant was filed against Florida\u0027s officers in the Archives. The Archive officers, although acting in official state capacity and defended by state attorneys, are not immune as the state itself may be from having to pay a judgment against them. Moreover, the Court found that although a profit sharing contract existed between Treasure and Archives, it did not justify Archive\u0027s refusal to surrender ownership over the artifacts pursuant to a federal warrant. Finally, the Court ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Florida\u0027s interest in the artifacts because these materials were held in a different district court\u0027s jurisdiction. As such, the decision was reversed in part and remanded as to its jurisdictional violations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42108,"name":"Susan Gamble Smathers","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/susan_gamble_smathers","view_count":0,"last_name":"Smathers","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"susan_gamble_smathers"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause pro hac vice for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12248"},{"advocate":{"ID":21009,"name":"David Paul Horan","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/david_paul_horan","view_count":0,"last_name":"Horan","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"david_paul_horan"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12249"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":19061,"title":"Oral Argument - January 20, 1982","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/19061"}],"citation":{"volume":"458","page":"670","year":"1982","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/16394"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

The avowed purpose of Cornerstone was to promote a knowledge and awareness of Jesus Christ on the campus. From 1973 to 1977, Cornerstone obtained permission to use university facilities for its weekly meetings and events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 1977, the group sought permission from the university to use two rooms of its Haag Hall Annex for two and a half hours every week. University officials asked for a description of the activities that would be conducted at the proposed meetings. Cornerstone told the university that worship in the form of prayer and biblical teaching would be an important part of the general atmosphere of the meetings. University officials rejected Cornerstone’s application for regular use of the rooms, concluding the meetings would violate several sections of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri. These regulations prohibited the use of university buildings and grounds for religious worship or religious teaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn December 11, 1979, the trial court granted summary judgment to Gary Widmar, the Dean of Students at the university, and the university’s Board of Curators, rejecting a motion for summary judgment filed by Cornerstone’s members. It concluded that the university’s ban on religious services in its buildings was required by the First Amendment’s establishment clause. It also held that the university did not violate the students’ free exercise rights, and that any violation was outweighed by Missouri’s compelling interest in the separation of church and state. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. It held that the university’s regulation had the primary effect of inhibiting religion, in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. Instead, the Eighth Circuit suggested that a neutral policy toward religious groups would satisfy the university’s First Amendment obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the refusal of the University of Missouri to accommodate voluntary student religious meetings violate Cornerstone members’ rights of equal access to a public forum protected by the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid the refusal of the University of Missouri to accommodate Cornerstone’s religious meetings unconstitutionally abridge freedoms of speech, association, and exercise of religion?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. In an 8-1 decision written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the Court held that the university’s policy violated Cornerstone members’ First Amendment rights. He reasoned that when the university opened its facilities to student meetings, it created a public forum for those student groups; given no other justification, the university excluded Cornerstone based on the content of its members’ speech. While acknowledging the university’s obligation to comply with its constitutional obligations, Justice Powell agreed with the Eighth Circuit that a neutral policy toward religion would achieve this end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Powell argued that any religious benefits from an open forum would be incidental because the forum was available to a broad class of both religious and nonreligious speakers and because the university was not showing approval of a particular religious sect or practice. Justice Powell rejected the university’s argument that the Missouri Constitution compelled it to exclude Cornerstone, noting that Cornerstone’s First Amendment interests outweighed this state interest through the supremacy clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred. He rejected the majority’s description of the university’s student meetings policy as the creation of a public forum, but agreed that the university failed to justify its refusal to allow Cornerstone to worship on campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White dissented. He rejected the argument that the university created a public forum, but also suggested that the university’s fear of appearing to subsidize religion was too extreme.

Amy was an excellent lip reading and had minimal residual hearing.  School administrators, along with a sign language expert, determined Amy was able to succeed in school without an interpreter.  Amy’s parents sued the school on her behalf for violation of the Education of All Handicapped Children Act of 1975.  The Act requires all schools that accept federal funds to provide a “free appropriate public education” to all handicapped students.  The Act also allows schools discretion in deciding what steps to take to accommodate handicapped students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court ruled in the Rowleys\u0027 favor, holding that while Amy was doing better in school than the average hearing student, she was not achieving to her full potential because she was unable to understand as much as she would with a sign language interpreter.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhat does “free and appropriate public education” require in the context of the Education of All Handicapped Children Act of 1975?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-3 decision, Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the court, reversing the lower court decisions.  The Supreme Court held that the Act does not require a school to provide a sign language interpreter to a deaf student when she is otherwise receiving personalized instruction and an adequate education.  School administrations are allowed to determine what is required to meet a handicapped students individual needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a special concurrence, expressing that no interpreter was required because Amy was given the opportunity to learn and participate in the classroom in a way that was substantially equal to her non-handicapped classmates.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, stating that the Act requires a school to provide a handicapped student with and education equal to non-handicapped children.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35662,"name":"Michael A.

Searching for a replacement, the Governor of Puerto Rico held a \"by-election\" open to candidates of all parties. The Party challenged the Governor, alleging that under Puerto Rico statutes only candidates and electors affiliated with the Party could participate in the by-election. On appeal from a Superior Court judgment favoring the Party, Puerto Rico\u0027s Supreme Court modified the judgment holding that a by-election was only required if the party of the legislator vacating the seat fails to name a replacement within 60 days. Before Puerto Rico\u0027s Supreme Court could deliver its decision, the Party held an election open only to its members and, then, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u0027s mandate, swore in a new representative. Rodriguez appealed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo Puerto Rico\u0027s statutes, authorizing a political party to appoint one of its own members as an interim replacement to a vacated seat, infringe on the constitutionally protected rights of association or equal protection?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court, in a unanimous opinion, began by noting that the Constitution does not compel a fixed method of selecting state or local representatives. As such, the Puerto Rican Commonwealth legislature could vest exclusive interim appointment power in parties affiliated with the previous incumbent. This scheme is particularly reasonable in light of Puerto Rico\u0027s interest in maintaining continuity of party representation until the next general election and insuring its legislature\u0027s delicate balance of minority representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38084,"name":"Philip A.

Following the death of his father, Romeo’s mother was unable to adequately care for Romeo and had him involuntarily committed to Pennhurst State School and Hospital (“Pennhurst”) on a permanent basis. During his time in the state facility, Romeo suffered injuries on numerous occasions and was physically restrained at times. Romeo’s mother became concerned, and after objecting to Romeo’s treatment several times, sued the facility on behalf of Romeo. Romeo’s mother claimed that his treatment violated the protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment. Specifically, Romeo’s mother claimed Romeo had the right to safe conditions of confinement, freedom from bodily restraints, and access to habilitation (training or treatment with the goal of eventual release).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, the court instructed the jury that they could only find that Pennhurst violated Romeo’s constitutional rights if the officials had been “deliberately indifferent” to Romeo’s medical and psychological needs, and the jury found in favor of Pennhurst. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Court of Appeals held the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment was inapplicable, because it applies to individuals convicted of crimes, not the involuntarily committed. However, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Romeo had liberty interests in freedom from restraint, safe conditions, and minimally adequate habilitation, which could only be violated if three distinct standards were met. An infringement of the right to safe conditions can only be justified by “substantial necessity,” the right to freedom from bodily restraints can only be infringed for “compelling necessity,” and the access to habilitation must be “acceptable in the light of present medical or other scientific knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grant an involuntarily committed patient the right to safe confinement?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grant an involuntarily committed patient the right to freedom from bodily restraints?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(3) Does the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grant an involuntarily committed patient the right to adequate habilitation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, unanswered. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Court held that the involuntarily committed do have liberty interests in safe confinement and freedom from bodily restraint under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, a historical right to adequate habilitation was less clear, made especially so by the facts of the case in question. Because no amount of habilitation would allow Romeo to live independently, the Court was unsure what would qualify as adequate habilitation. The Court held that Romeo’s liberty interests required Pennhurst to provide adequate habilitation, but only as it related to Romeo’s right to safe confinement and freedom from undue restraint. The Court declined to answer whether the Fourteenth Amendment includes a stand-alone right to adequate habilitation, or how to determine the level of habilitation required to protect other liberty interests under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court emphasized the need to balance the legitimate interests of both parties involved to determine whether liberty interests were being adequately protected. In the involuntary commitment arena, deference to qualified professionals is necessary because of their specialized knowledge and the specific circumstances and risks inherent in a mental hospital. Therefore, such professionals and institutions can only be held liable for infringements on liberty interests when the decision by a professional is a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a concurrence emphasizing that the majority opinion had correctly not ruled on whether a state can accept an individual for care and then refuse treatment or whether the right to habilitation required Pennhurst to offer adequate training to preserve Romeo’s original basic self-care skills. He argued that the record was not adequately developed to address these two issues. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the concurrence. In his separate concurrence, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that the Fourteenth Amendment did not contained a separate right to habilitation.

From 1974 until 1976, Ohio state courts operated as though this statute did not affect Ohio\u0027s traditional rule that a defendant had to prove an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. However, in 1976 the Supreme Court of Ohio found that the statute placed only the burden of production of such evidence — as opposed to the burden of persuasion — on the defendant, and jury instructions were altered accordingly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe respondents, Lincoln Isaac, Kenneth Bell, and Howard Hughes, each had separate trials that occurred after the 1974 statute was put in place, but before the 1976 decision. At the time of their trials, none of the respondents objected to the jury instructions regarding how the jury should consider evidence of self-defense. The Ohio Criminal Code required defendants to raise any objections to jury instructions at the time the instructions are given. The respondents filed petitions in federal district courts for writs of habeas corpus and used the 1976 decision to challenge the jury instructions trial. The courts denied the writs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the convictions, and rejected the argument regarding the jury instructions because it had not been made at the time of the trial. The Ohio Supreme Court declined to review the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the respondents claim they are entitled to federal writs of habeas corpus where the Ohio courts refused to allow them to challenge Ohio state jury instructions after the fact?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, writing for a 7-2 majority, ruled in favor of Engle and stated that the respondents cannot challenge the constitutionality of the Ohio jury instructions in federal habeas corpus proceedings. The Court held that the respondents forfeited their right to object to the jury instructions when they did not comply with the Ohio Criminal Code that specified they must make any objections at the time of the trial. The Court also found that the jury instructions themselves were not unconstitutional, as they depend on how a state defines the elements of a particular crime. The jury instructions were consistent with the Ohio state laws regarding to what extent the prosecution must disprove certain affirmative defenses. Thus, the respondents did not have constitutional grounds for the writ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice John Paul Stevens agreed with the judgment of the Court that the petition for the writs should be dismissed. However, he argued that such an error in jury instructions would not have resulted in a grave miscarriage of justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. found that the Court’s dismissal of Isaac’s petition on procedural grounds is illogical, given that Isaac’s claim did not exist when he could have raised the appropriate objection at trial. He also found that the double-pronged standard of cause and prejudice that the Court uses to determine if there are grounds for a habeas claim is too high for any defendant to reasonably meet. He was joined in the dissent by Justice Thurgood Marshall.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41619,"name":"Simon B.

Recalling the Court\u0027s holding in Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia (1980), Justice Brennan reviewed important historical and judicial reasons why access to criminal trials is \"properly afforded\" First Amendment protection. When the court denies access, argued Brennan, the only justification is to serve a compelling state interest. The Court found no such interest here. First, protecting the psychological well-being of a minor, arguably a compelling interest, conceded Brennan, \"does not justify a mandatory closure rule\" as circumstances can vary greatly in this type of case. Second, there was no convincing empirical or logical evidence to prove that victims would be more likely to come forward if the press and public were excluded from trials of this nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36747,"name":"Mitchell J.

Until 1963, both plants were segregated, and the better job opportunities were reserved for white employees. Between 1963 and 1968, the plants were officially desegregated, but the promotion policies were left mostly to the discretion of the supervisors. The best jobs continued to go to the white employees. In November 1968, the company proposed nine new lines of employment progression that linked bottom jobs with the top job a worker could eventually receive. Four of the lines linked majority-white bottom jobs with majority-white top jobs; two of the lines linked majority-black bottom jobs with majority-black top jobs. The top jobs for the majority-white progression lines were the best jobs in the factories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn January 3, 1969, John Patterson and two other employees filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In 1973, alleging violations of the Civil Rights Act, the employees sued the company in district court . The district court held that the lines of progression violated the Act and prohibited the company from using them. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth District affirmed and remanded the case for further proceedings to determine the remedy. The Supreme Court denied certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn remand, the petitioners filed a motion to dismiss the complaints by arguing that the seniority system was exempt from the Civil Rights Act. The district court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision because that the lines of progression are not a seniority system. The Court of Appeals also held that the immunity for seniority systems only extends to those in place before the effective date of the Civil Rights Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the section of the Civil Rights Act that affirms the legality of seniority systems apply to those adopted after the effective date of the Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the absence of any sort of grandfather clause or explicit distinction between pre- and post-Act systems meant that the section applied to all seniority systems, regardless of when they were put in place. There was no clear legislative history to support the distinction between pre-existing systems and those that were implemented later. The Court also held that such a reading would drastically shift national labor policy away from the balance that Congress intended the section to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. argued that the decision of the Court ignored the crucial distinction between the adoption of a seniority system and its application. The section’s clear use of the language of application on the part of the employer — without any mention of adoption or the union — indicated a more narrow meaning. He also argued that the legislative history showed that Congress meant the Act to have a stronger effect on systems put in place after the effective date of the Act. Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent where he expressed that the Court misread the section as referring to seniority systems both before and after the effective date of the Act. He argued that the purpose of the section was limited to determining which of the pre-Act systems should be considered legal and which should not; the section has no bearing on any post-Act systems. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27625,"name":"Henry L.

The purpose of the boycott was to promote equality and racial justice. The boycott consisted of nonviolent picketing, but some acts and threats of violence also occurred. In 1969, white merchants sued the NAACP for damages as a result of the injuries to their businesses that the boycott caused. These damages included loss of earnings over a seven-year period. The Chancery Court imposed damages liability and the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the imposition of tort liability as well as concluding the entire boycott was unlawful since the NAACP agreed to use force, violence, and “threats” to carryout the boycott.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre the nonviolent elements of the petitioners’ activities entitled to the protection of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1) If so, is a protest liable in damages caused by the nonviolent, protected activity?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the 8-0 majority. The Court held that the nonviolent elements of the protesters’ activities are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment. In this case, the members of the NAACP exercised their First Amendment right of speech, assembly, and petition in a nonviolent way to bring about social change. The NAACP is not liable in damages for the consequences of their nonviolent activity and the damages cannot be recovered because the violence or threats of violence were not a proximate cause of the business losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34255,"name":"Lloyd N.

All organizations subject to the Act must file extensive annual reports with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The Department may deny or withdraw the registration of any organization that engages in fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices. From 1961 until 1978, all religious organizations were exempt from the Act. In 1978, the state legislature amended the Act to include religious organizations that received more than fifty percent of their funding from solicitations of nonmembers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after the amendment, the Department notified the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (Unification Church) that it must register under the Act. Pamela Valente and other members of the Church responded by suing and alleging that the Act violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The United States Magistrate granted a preliminary injunction and held that the Act failed the second part of the Lemon Test, that the primary effect of a law must neither advance nor inhibit religion. Accepting the recommendation of the Magistrate, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. The Court of Appeals affirmed that the fifty percent rule violated the Establishment Clause, but held that proof of status as a religious organization was required to be exempt from the Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Minnesota Charitable Solicitation Act, which imposes registration and reporting requirements on religious organizations that solicit more than fifty percent of their funds from nonmembers, violate the Establishment Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the fifty percent rule clearly distinguished between denominations and created denominational preferences within the law, and it did not serve a compelling government interest. The Court also held that the Act failed the three-part test established in \u003ci\u003eLemon v. Kurtzman\u003c/i\u003e by fostering the government entanglement in religion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that, although it is unclear whether or not the Unification Church would be considered a religious organization under the Act before the amendment, the judicial record has assumed it to be, so the majority’s decision to treat it as such is consistent with the orderly administration of justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissent and argued that the majority erred by examining the case under a different framework than the previous courts, and should have remanded the case. He also argued that the majority should not have rejected the argument that the state has a valid secular purpose in preventing fraudulent charities from preying on the public. Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a separate dissent, Justice William H. Rehnquist argued that it is the Unification Church’s status as a charitable organization that makes it eligible for the registration requirement, not its status as a religious organization under the fifty percent rule, which establishes exemptions. Since it is unclear whether the Unification Church is a religious organization under the Act, he argued it was improper for the majority’s opinion to rule on the constitutionality issue.

The agreement did not increase benefits for widows of coal miners who were still working at the time they died, although they were eligible for pensions.  These health benefits were paid out of a trust fund financed by the operators.  Gracie Robinson and Juanita Hager brought this class action on behalf of all similarly situated widows.  They alleged that requiring the worker to be receiving a pension at the time of death to qualify for increased health benefits bore no relation to the purpose of the trust.  The district court denied relief, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  The Court of Appeals held that the collective bargaining agreement failed to meet the reasonable standard set out in the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA).  The LMRA requires pension trusts to be maintained “for the sole and exclusive benefit of employees…and their families”.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Court of Appeals have authority to review the terms of a collective bargaining agreement under a reasonableness standard?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for a unanimous court, reversed the court of appeals.  The Supreme Court held that the LMRA does not have a reasonableness requirement.  The relevant section of the LMRA is merely meant to protect employees from having their benefit funds used for other union purposes.  The collective bargaining agreement did not violate any command of Congress, so the Court had no authority to modify its terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35086,"name":"Larry Franklin Sword","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/larry_franklin_sword","view_count":0,"last_name":"Sword","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"larry_franklin_sword"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12373"},{"advocate":{"ID":22334,"name":"E.

He did not pay quarterly social security taxes, and in 1978, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed $27,000 in unpaid taxes.  Lee paid the portion due for the first quarter of 1973 and sued for a refund.  Lee argued that the tax violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion.  In the Amish religion, it is a sin not to provide for the community’s elderly and needy citizens.  Lee argued that paying the federal government for Social Security violates that provision of his religion by giving the responsibility of caring for the elderly and needy to the government.  The district court held that the Social Security tax was unconstitutional as applied.  The court also noted that §1402(g) provides an exception to the social security tax for certain self employed individuals.  The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the U.S. government require payment of Social Security taxes from those who religiously object to the receipt of the attached benefits?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a unanimous decision, Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote the majority opinion reversing and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that the §1402(g) exemption only applied to self-employed individuals, not employers and employees like those involved in this case.  The Court held that the tax was not unconstitutional as applied.  By becoming an employer, Lee entered into commercial activity and accepted certain limits on the exercise of his beliefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurrence, stating that the tax objector has the burden of showing that there is a unique reason for allowing an exemption from a valid law when the objectors religious obligation and civic obligation are irreconcilable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23801,"name":"Francis X.

Enmund was the getaway driver, who waited in the car during the robbery, did not participate in the killing and had no idea anyone would be killed.  Enmund argued that the evidence did not show any intent to kill, so the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment.  Despite this, the jury sentenced him to death along with his codefendants.  The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is death an unconstitutionally excessive and disproportionate penalty under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments for one who did not take a life, attempt to take a life, nor intend to take a life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was petitioner\u0027s degree of participation in the killings given inadequate consideration by the Florida courts?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that imposing the death penalty on someone who aided and abetted but did not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend to kill, violated the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments.  It is unlikely that the death penalty could deter someone who did not intend to kill or attempt to kill, and putting someone to death for two killings they did not commit is disproportionate retribution.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. concurred, writing that the death penalty is cruel and unusual in all circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor dissented, arguing that the majority’s decision is not supported by prior precedent.  The Florida Supreme Court rejected critical factual findings, so the case should be remanded for a new sentencing hearing.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Lewis F. Powell, and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34677,"name":"Lawrence A.

However, after an investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division (“CID”), the murder charges were dropped, and MacDonald was given an honorable discharge. Following MacDonald’s discharge, the U.S. Justice Department asked the Army CID to continue its investigation into the murders, and in 1972 the CID created a report on the murders that recommended further investigation into MacDonald. After evaluating the report, the Justice Department presented the case to a grand jury in the fall of 1974, which returned an indictment for MacDonald in January of 1975 that charged him again with all three murders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacDonald moved to dismiss the indictment and argued that the delay between the original murder charge in 1970 and the grand jury indictment in 1974 violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The district court denied MacDonald’s motion. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the district court by finding that the time-gap between the 1972 CID report to the Justice Department and the 1974 convening of a grand jury infringed on MacDonald’s Sixth Amendment rights. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari, reversed and remanded. The Court held that MacDonald could not appeal the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of the 6th amendment right to speedy trial until after the trial has been completed. MacDonald was tried and convicted of all three murders. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit again held the indictment violated MacDonald’s Sixth Amendment rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas MacDonald’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial violated by the gap between the 1972 CID’s report recommending further investigation into MacDonald and the re-filing of those same charges in 1975?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the speedy trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is intended to protect citizens from the extended disruptions that may accompany being charged with a crime, such as social stigma, anxiety, and the financial burden of defending oneself in court. In the current case, these interests were not being infringed during the period between the original dismissal and the re-filing of the murder charges because MacDonald was not under arrest, in custody, or subject to any criminal prosecution. Though the situation may have led to stress or other adverse consequence, once the original charges had been dismissed, MacDonald was in the same position as he would have been if charges had never been filed. The Court held that MacDonald could not claim his Sixth Amendment right was being infringed after the dismissal of the original charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that MacDonald’s right to a speedy trial was not suspended during the period between the original dismissal and re-filing. However, the importance of allowing the Government to be cautious before prosecuting MacDonald for such a serious crime meant that the delay did not violate MacDonald’s right to a speedy trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented and argued that the majority opinion failed to take certain facts into account when determining the original charges and the re-filed charges were distinct events between which MacDonald’s right to a speedy trial was not implicated. Not only did the investigation not end when the original charges were dismissed, but MacDonald was also aware the investigation was ongoing. Multiple times between 1972 and 1974, MacDonald requested the Government complete its investigation and even offered to sit for further interviews. Furthermore, the Government never offered any legitimate reason for the delay in re-filing the charges. Neither the language of the Sixth Amendment nor Supreme Court precedent supported the majority’s narrow view of when a criminal prosecution is taking place. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40542,"name":"Ralph S.

Government agencies tasked with supplying federal funding to educational institutions were authorized to create regulations to enforce Title IX. In 1975, one of these agencies, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (“HEW”) passed regulations that extended the prohibition on gender discrimination to school personnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmployees of two Connecticut school districts, North Haven and Trumbull, accused the districts of practicing gender discrimination. HEW opened investigations into both districts and eventually warned both that they were in jeopardy of losing their federal funds. Both districts filed separate suits against HEW, claiming that the regulation went beyond the authority of Title IX, which does not explicitly cover gender-based employee discrimination. In both cases, the district court found for the school districts by holding that Title IX was intended to apply to students, not employees. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district courts and held that Congress had intended Title IX to apply to both students and employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Title IX’s prohibition on gender discrimination in schools intended to cover the employees of schools?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that, while Title IX does not expressly include employees, Congress’s choice of words, i.e. “no person” as opposed to “student” or “beneficiary”, implies an intention to broadly cover individuals involved in educational institutions rather than only students. The legislative history of Title IX supports the inference that Congress intended Title IX to prohibit gender discrimination of employees. Additionally, Congress was given the opportunity to view HEW’s regulations and pass a resolution of disapproval if the regulations were inconsistent with Title IX. While such a resolution concerning the employee discrimination regulation was introduced, it was not passed. Therefore, Congress appeared to intend Title IX to apply to employee discrimination, and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s regulations were valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a dissent in which he argued that the language of Title IX, on its face, did not apply to employee discrimination. Legislative history can only override the language of a law if the legislative history is clear and unambiguous that Congress intended Title IX to apply to employee discrimination. In this case, the majority opinion relied primarily on the statements of one congressman when analyzing the legislative history, which is not sufficient to support the majority’s conclusion. Therefore Justice Powell held that Title IX did not apply to employee discrimination. Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38045,"name":"Paul E.

Ernest Fitzgerald, a management analyst in the Department of the Air Force, testified before the Subcommittee on Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Committee of the U. S. Congress regarding $2 billion in unexpected costs associated with the C5-A transport plane along with its technical difficulties. In January 1970, he was fired, and he believed his dismissal was in retaliation for his testimony. Fitzgerald sued presidential aides Bryce Harlow and Alexander Butterfield for civil damages and claimed they were involved in a conspiracy that resulted in his wrongful dismissal. Both Harlow and Butterfield claimed to have no knowledge of any conspiracy and asserted that their actions surrounding this issue were undertaken in good faith. Harlow and Butterfield moved for summary judgment, which the court denied. The district court also found them ineligible for immunity. They appealed the denial of immunity to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal without issuing an opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre presidential aides entitled to immunity from civil suits?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell delivered the opinion of the 8-1 majority. The Court held that government officials are entitled to qualified immunity but not absolute immunity. Absolute immunity is only available for specific functions that require a total shield from liability. The Court held that qualified immunity was necessary for the government officials to carry out their jobs and that the courts could adequately determine whether an action falls within the scope of qualified immunity based on whether the official knew or should have known that his/her actions would violate the plaintiff’s constitutional rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote that the “knew or should have known” standard the majority established would often require discovery to determine what a defendant actually knew. He argued that the issues surrounding discovery of such evidence could be handled by a trial judge pending any motion for summary judgment made on the basis of qualified immunity. Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Byron R. White, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun concurred, but emphasized that \u003ci\u003eNixon v. Fitzgerald\u003c/i\u003e, a similar case where they dissented, was wrongly decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a dissent where he argued that, based on the Court’s previous decisions that granted absolute immunity to legislative aides, presidential aides should also receive absolute immunity. He argued that the degree of immunity for a government official should depend on that official’s function rather than that official’s place in the hierarchy. Since the President relies on his aides to perform the duties of his office, the aides should be considered “alter egos” for legal purposes and entitled to the same absolute immunity. Without that assurance of immunity for aides, the President’s functionality would greatly diminish. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27551,"name":"Herbert J.
