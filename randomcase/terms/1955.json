This Act was implemented prior to Congress\u0027s adoption of the Smith Act of 1940 (amended in 1948) which prohibited the same conduct as Pennsylvania\u0027s law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Smith Act supersede enforcement of Pennsylvania\u0027s sedition law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that Pennsylvania\u0027s law was unenforceable and was superseded by the federal act. Chief Justice Warren argued that the scheme of federal regulation of seditious activities was \"pervasive\" and \"left no room for the states to supplement it.\" Furthermore, the federal act dealt with an issue of primary importance to the national government which made any enforcement of similar state laws potentially harmful to the smooth execution of national statutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13051,"title":"Oral Argument - November 16, 1955 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13051"},{"id":13092,"title":"Oral Argument - November 15, 1955","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13092"},{"id":13100,"title":"Oral Argument - November 16, 1955 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13100"}],"citation":{"volume":"350","page":"497","year":"1956","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/23962"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Harry Slochower, a tenured professor at Brooklyn College, invoked this privilege in a congressional committee investigation into his past Communist Party membership.  Despite his tenured status, which required notice and a hearing before termination, the city terminated him immediately.  The state trial court dismissed a motion to review the discharge and the Court of Appeals of New York affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes §903 violate Due Process by denying notice or a hearing before discharge?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Tom C. Clark, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that dismissal of the review motion was improper.  §903 is unconstitutional as applied in this case because it denies due process of law.  The Court emphasized that invoking the Fifth Amendment does not amount to an admission of guilt. Justices Hugo L. Black and William O. Douglas concurred, writing that they also adhered to the views in their dissents in \u003ci\u003eGarner v. Board of Public Works\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eAdler v. Board of Education\u003c/i\u003e, and their concurrence in \u003ci\u003eWeiman v. Updegraff\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stanley Reed dissented, expressing that New York City had a reasonable ground to require employees to give information about their official conduct or give up their positions.  Justices Sherman Minton and Harold Burton joined in the dissent.  Justice John M. Harlan wrote a separate dissent, stating that no Due Process violation occurred in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22695,"name":"Ephraim London","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/ephraim_london","view_count":0,"last_name":"London","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"ephraim_london"},"advocate_description":"for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21899"},{"advocate":{"ID":21517,"name":"Daniel T.

Mr. Cole brought an action seeking declaratory judgment in the District of Columbia federal district court alleging that his discharge was invalid and that the Civil Service Commission improperly denied his appeal.

Circuit, holding that the discharge of an employee without determination that his position was one in which he could adversely affect national security was unauthorized by the Veterans\u0027 Preference Act. With Justice John Marshall Harlan II writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that the Act\u0027s use of \"national security\" only relates to the nation\u0027s safety, and not the general welfare. Moreover, there was no determination that Mr. Cole\u0027s position within the FDA affected national security as the term is used in the Act. Therefore, the Court concluded, Mr. Cole\u0027s discharge was invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13014,"title":"Oral Argument - March 06, 1956 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13014"},{"id":13017,"title":"Oral Argument - March 06, 1956 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13017"}],"citation":{"volume":"351","page":"536","year":"1956","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24024"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Pursuant to a “status-of-forces” executive agreement with England, she was tried and convicted by US court-martial without a jury trial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). She petitioned a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that the conviction violated her Fifth \u0026amp; Sixth Amendment rights to be tried by a jury after indictment by a grand jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo American citizens abroad retain the rights granted to them by the Bill of Rights thus rendering Article 2(11) of the United State Code of Military Justice unconstitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eU.S. citizen civilians outside of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States cannot be tried by U.S. military tribunal, but instead retain the protections guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a decision authored by Justice Hugo Black, the Court held that U.S. citizen civilians abroad have the right to Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment constitutional protections. The Court agreed with the petitioners, concluding that as United States citizens they were entitled to the protections of the Bill of Rights, notwithstanding that they committed crimes on foreign soil. Justice Black declared: \"The concept that the Bill of Rights and other constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperative when they become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefit of a written Constitution and undermine the basis of our government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a majority of the Court agreed with the ultimate result, they did so for different reasons. Concurring in the decision, Justice Felix Frankfurter rejected the idea that the Necessary and Proper Clause could prevent Congress from mandating the court martial of civilians in all cases. He opposed what he termed a \"recourse to the literal words\" of the Constitution. Merely to hold that Mrs. Covert could not stand trial before a military tribunal since she was not a member of the armed forces signified too narrow a review. In his opinion, that determination required the Court to assess the Constitution in its entirety and not simply the single provision granting Congress the power to regulate the nation\u0027s land and naval forces. He advocated a balancing test that would require a court to weigh \"all the factors involved...in order to decide whether [military dependents] are so closely related to what Congress may allowably deem essential for the effective...regulation of the land and naval forces that they may be subjected to court-martial jurisdiction in...capital cases, when the consequence is loss of [their constitutional] protections.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso concurring in the judgment, Justice John Marshall Harlan II essentially agreed with Frankfurter. Accordingly, he saw the determination as \"analogous to issues of due process.\" Having first determined that military dependents overseas bear a rational connection to the armed forces such that they could be validly subjected to court martial, he then asserted that the analysis turned on a question of what process was due a military dependent under the \"particular circumstances of a particular case.\" While capital cases such as this one certainly necessitated a full Article III trial, most petty offenses committed by military dependents almost certainly would not. He thus advocated a case-by-case approach, rejecting the sweeping conclusion set forth by the plurality. Since Harlan had originally voted with the majority in the initial decision of this case, his concurrence on rehearing was narrow but significant. Perhaps as a consequence of his earlier vote in the previous term, his opinion on rehearing was considerably less at odds with the arguments set forth in the dissent written by Justice Tom C. Clark and joined by Justice Harold Burton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that staunch dissent, Clark gave substantial weight to historical practice. He asserted that the \"military has always exercised jurisdiction by court-martial over civilians accompanying armies in time of war,\" and that for explicit reasons of policy concerning military morale and discipline, none of the Court\u0027s relevant precedents had ever questioned that authority. He pointed out several troublesome and practical consequences of the Court\u0027s holding. Not least among these were the vast distances between the United States and its various military instillations around the world. By setting forth an overly broad standard, the plurality, argued Clark, had opened the door to a myriad of petty offenses to be tried in the federal court system, thus incurring needless cost, delay, and disruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Charles Whitaker took no part in the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHistorical Note\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eReid v. Covert\u003c/em\u003e has the distinction of being the only case in the history of the Supreme Court in which the Court reversed itself on rehearing. In successfully persuading the Court to do so, Mrs. Covert\u0027s lawyer, Colonel Frederick Bernays Wiener, secured for himself a seat among the giants of the legal profession. A seasoned veteran of Supreme Court litigation, Colonel Wiener considered his triumph in \u003cem\u003eReid v. Covert\u003c/em\u003e to be among his greatest professional accomplishments. His oral argument in the case has attained legendary status and remains a preeminent exemplar in the art of persuasion and appellate advocacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Lognion contributed this abstract.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35822,"name":"Marvin E.
