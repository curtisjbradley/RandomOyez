Part of the ordinance allowed a Mediating Hearing Officer to consider as one factor \"hardship to a tenant\" when evaluating rent increases imposed by landlords.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the ordinance violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court held that the ordinance was rationally crafted to protect the financial investments of landlords while simultaneously preventing tenants from becoming victims of burdensome rent increases.

Murray and James D. Carter for suspicion of illegal drug activities saw the two drive large vehicles into a warehouse in South Boston. When Murray and Carter left, the agents saw a tractor-trailer rig and a large container. The agents arrested Murray and Carter and lawfully seized their vehicles, which contained marijuana. Several agents then returned to the warehouse, forced entry without a search warrant, and found numerous wrapped bales of what was later confirmed to be marijuana. The agents did not disturb the bales and kept the warehouse under surveillance until they obtained a search warrant. In applying for the search warrant, the agents did not mention the unwarranted entry or the information they had obtained. Approximately eight hours later, the agents obtained the warrant, entered the warehouse, and seized the bales along with the notebooks indicating the destinations of the marijuana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the trial, Murray and Carter moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the warehouse and argued that the warrant was invalid because it was based on information obtained in the previous unwarranted entry. The district court denied the motion and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment require the suppression of evidence viewed in plain sight prior to an illegal entry that was later discovered in the course of a properly warranted search?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the 4-3 plurality. The Court held that evidence that would be excluded under the Fourth Amendment is admissible if it comes from an independent source. If the police obtained information unlawfully but the evidence in question comes from an untainted source, it is still admissible. Because the officers in this case obtained a lawful warrant without relying on the information they obtained illegally, the evidence seized in the warranted entry can be considered to have come from an independent source and therefore not subject to exclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that the independent source exception is limited to cases in which the evidence in question stemmed from a wholly independent source. He argued that courts must keep in mind the incentives that police officers have to hide the use of illegal methods in obtaining evidence, and they must use a high standard of proof when determining whether evidence came from a truly independent source. Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that court decisions that incentivize police officers to obtain evidence through illegal means moves further away from the true meaning of and protections offered by the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the decision or discussion of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39134,"name":"Roy T.

A group of New Jersey public school teachers, students, and parents sued the New Jersey Department of Education, its Commissioner, and two township boards of education. The suit alleged that the statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. After the named defendants and the New Jersey Attorney General refused to defend the statute, Alan J. Karcher, the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, and Carmen A. Orechio, the President of the New Jersey Senate, intervened as defendants on behalf of the Legislature. The district court ruled against them and declared the \"minute-of-silence\" statute unconstitutional. Karcher and Orechio appealed the ruling in their official capacities as presiding officers of the Legislature. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, and shortly thereafter, Karcher and Orechio lost their respective officer positions. They subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court, but the successors to their offices indicated to the Court that they were withdrawing the appeal on behalf of the Legislature. The plaintiffs argued that the withdrawal of the appeal ended the controversy and that the Court no longer had jurisdiction to review the case, according to Article III of the Constitution. Karcher and Orechio countered that they should be permitted to continue the appeal in their capacities as legislators and representatives of the legislative body that enacted the statute. Alternatively, they argued that the Court should vacate the judgment of the lower court upon their dismissal as appellants. They contended that New Jersey law does not authorize presiding legislative officers to represent the Legislature in litigation, and they argued that their loss of presiding officer status rendered the judgment unappealable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIssues:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. May public officials who have participated in a lawsuit solely in their official capacities appeal an adverse judgment after they have left office?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. If not, must the appellate court vacate the judgment of the lower court on the grounds that it is unreviewable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and No. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion of the 8-0 majority. The Court held that once the individuals left their offices, the authority to pursue the lawsuit on behalf of the Legislature passed to their successors. Because Karcher and Orechio’s successors withdrew the appeal, there was no longer an active case or controversy, so the Court had no jurisdiction to hear the case under Article III. The Court further held that the appellants\u0027 intervention and participation in the lawsuit as president and speaker did not entitle them to appeal as individual legislators. The Court rejected both theories that Karcher and Orechio offered in support of vacating the lower court\u0027s judgment and noted that the first argument appeared to be wrong as a matter of New Jersey State law and directly contrary to Karch and Orechio\u0027s representations to the district court. The Court also held that the loss of Karcher and Orechio\u0027s right to appeal from the appellate court\u0027s ruling did not render the case unreviewable, instead it was their successors\u0027 refusal to pursue the appeal that caused the judgment to become final.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he agreed with the Court that Karcher and Orechio lost their authority to appeal on behalf of the New Jersey Legislature when they were no longer presiding officers of the General Assembly and Senate. Rather than hear this matter, Justice White argued that the Court should have reversed its prior order denying a motion by parents and school teachers to intervene as appellants before the Court.

Ike Kozminski, his wife Margarethe, and his son John used the labor of Fulmer and Molitoris seven days a week, for approximately 17 hours a day since they brought the men to the farm. Margarethe picked up Fulmer from the side of road in 1967, and by doing so took him away from a farm where he previously worked. Ike Kozminski found Molitoris living on the streets in Ann Arbor in the early 1970s and brought him to the farm to work. At first, the men received $15 per day, and later they received no pay at all. Although both men were in their sixties, they had the mental capacity of children between 8 and 10 years old. The Kozminskis told Fulmer and Molitoris that they could not leave the farm, and on one occasion John Kozminski threatened Molitoris with institutionalization. They also failed to provide the men with adequate nutrition, housing, and medical care, and told them not to contact their families or any other outsiders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, a herdsman who worked for the Kozminskis became concerned for the welfare of Fulmer and Molitoris and alerted the authorities. County officials removed the men, and the Kozminskis were tried in federal district court for holding Fulmer and Molitoris in involuntary servitude. Based on jury instructions that included forms of coercion other than purely physical, the jury found the Kozminskis guilty. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the convictions on the grounds that the District Court’s definition of involuntary servitude was too broad.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the protection from involuntary servitude guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment extend to the use of psychological coercion?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Court held that precedent had established that the type of involuntary servitude prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment is limited to that “enforced by the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion.” Involuntary servitude had never before been extended to cover labor compelled by the use of psychological coercion. The government’s use of a broader interpretation makes the criminal nature of the action dependent on the victim’s state of mind, which cannot always be foreseen. The mental state of the victim is only relevant in determining whether or not the physical or legal coercion was effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote that the Court unnecessarily narrowed the definition of the involuntary servitude. He argued that there are many different methods of coercion that can all be equally effective in reducing the victim to a state of involuntary servitude. The proper understanding of the term is defined by the conditions of servitude that the Thirteenth Amendment was meant to eradicate: conditions similar to those of slaves before the Civil War. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in this concurring opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred in the judgment. He argued that the attempt to define “involuntary servitude” based on hypothetical situations is irrelevant to the legal issues at hand. Rather, he found that the statute was written to be decided on a case-by-case basis. In this case, the defendants were rightfully convicted on the basis of jury instructions, but Justice Stevens agreed with the Court of Appeals finding that expert testimony was erroneously admitted. Therefore, he agreed with judgment of the Court that the case should be remanded. Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the concurrence in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20441,"name":"Carl Ziemba","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/carl_ziemba","view_count":0,"last_name":"Ziemba","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"carl_ziemba"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14423"},{"advocate":{"ID":45975,"name":"William Bradford Reynolds","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_bradford_reynolds","view_count":0,"last_name":"Reynolds","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"william_bradford_reynolds"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14424"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":19207,"title":"Oral Argument - February 23, 1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/19207"}],"citation":{"volume":"487","page":"931","year":"1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/17387"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

Boyle, Delbert Boyle sued the helicopter\u0027s manufacturer (\"Sikorsky\") for defectively designing its copilot emergency escape hatch. On appeal from a state-law based jury verdict favoring Boyle, the Court of Appeals found that Sikorsky could not be held liable under Virginia tort law for any design flaws since it met the requirements of the \"military contractor defense.\" Boyle appealed; the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre state tort laws, holding independent military contractors liable for injuries caused by their design flaws, valid?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to4 decision, the Court held that despite the absence of specific legislation immunizing government contractors from liability for design flaws, questions of their liability are of unique federal concern. As such, to the extent that it holds military contractors liable for design flaws, state law may significantly conflict with federal interests thereby requiring its displacement. The Court added that in the instant case, such displacement is appropriate since the United States approved the helicopter\u0027s specifications, the equipment met those specifications, and Sikorsky warned the government of possible dangers in the helicopter\u0027s use. Finally, since the Court of Appeals\u0027 use of the \"military contractor defense\" failed to specify if a reasonable jury could have found for Boyle, the Court vacated its judgment and remanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34453,"name":"Louis Stanton Franecke","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/louis_stanton_franecke","view_count":0,"last_name":"Franecke","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"louis_stanton_franecke"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14432"},{"advocate":{"ID":38084,"name":"Philip A.

Braswell refused to produce the documents, citing his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  The district court ruled against Braswell, holding that the “collective entity doctrine”, which treats corporations differently from individuals for Fifth Amendment purposes, applied.  The court rejected Braswell’s argument that the doctrine does not apply where the corporation is so small that it is merely the individual’s alter ego.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the custodian of corporate records have the right to resist a subpoena of those records under his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William J. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion affirming.  The Supreme Court held that corporations are not protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  An agent of the corporation holds the official records of the corporation in their representative, and not individual, capacity so the personal privilege is not applicable.  Allowing corporations a privilege against self-incrimination would be detrimental to enforcement of government regulations and prosecution of white-collar crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39134,"name":"Roy T.

Doe had a disability which caused him considerable difficulty in controlling his impulses. On November 6, 1980, Doe was teased by a fellow student and responded by attacking the student and kicking out a school window. Doe was subsequently suspended pending expulsion proceedings. After unsuccessfully protesting the suspension by letter, Doe brought an action against school authorities under the Education of the Handicapped Act.  Jack Smith was another handicapped student whose disability caused behavioral problems. Smith engaged in disruptive behavior and was eventually suspended indefinitely pending a hearing. Smith brought an action in district court essentially identical to the one brought by Doe. After learning of Doe\u0027s action Smith joined Doe\u0027s suit.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handicapped students asked the district court to enter an order requiring the school to allow the students to return to their own schools. The district court granted the handicapped students\u0027 request and issued a permanent injunction, an order which prevented the school district from indefinitely suspending a student for disability-related misconduct. The school authorities appealed, and the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u0027s opinion. The school authorities appealed the appellate court\u0027s decision. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is a claim brought under the Education of the Handicapped Act moot if the claimant is over the age of 21?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the \"stay-put\" provision of the Education of the Handicapped Act prevent a school district from indefinitely suspending a student whose handicap-related misconduct endangered the student and others? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and Yes. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice William J. Brennan, held that since the Act covered individuals from ages 3 to 21, the claim of a 24-year-old who was no longer in school was moot, but that the claim of a 20-year-old was not moot. The Supreme Court further held that the \"stay-put\" provision of the Education of the Handicapped Act prohibited state or local school authorities from excluding disabled children from the classroom even for dangerous or disruptive conduct resulting from their disabilities. The Supreme Court thereby affirmed the lower court\u0027s opinion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice William H. Rehnquist concurred and wrote separately on the mootness issue. He agreed with the court\u0027s determination but emphasized that he would go further in relaxing the test of mootness, particularly when events giving rise to mootness occurred after certiorari was granted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia filed a dissent which Justice O\u0027Connor joined. He stated that the controversy was moot because it was unlikely that the 20-year-old plaintiff would return to public school. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40998,"name":"Sheila L.

Juvenal Gomez-Barajas and Javier Bravo were also allegedly involved in the operation. Attorney Eugene Iredale represented Gomez-Barajas and Bravo at trial. The trial court acquitted Gomez-Barajas on drug charges that overlapped with charges against Wheat, but Gomez-Barajas pleaded guilty to tax evasion and illegal importation of merchandise to avoid a second trial. At the beginning of Wheat’s trial, however, the court had not yet accepted Gomez-Barajas’ plea and he was free to withdraw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn August 22, 1985, Bravo pleaded guilty to one count of transporting 2,400 pounds of marijuana. Immediately after the proceedings, Iredale informed the court that Wheat contacted him to hire him as additional counsel; Gomez-Barajas and Bravo waived any objection. The United States expressed concern about the possibility of conflict arising from Iredale’s representation of both Iredale and Gomez-Barajas. The government pointed out that if Gomez-Barajas withdrew his plea, it was likely Wheat would be required to appear at his trial as a witness. In that event, Iredale would not be allowed to cross-examine Wheat. Further, it was possible that Bravo would be required to appear at Wheat’s trial as a witness as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Wheat emphasized his right to his choice of counsel under the sixth amendment, the district court denied his motion for a substitution of counsel. Wheat was convicted of conspiracy to possess 1,000 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute and five counts of possessing marijuana with intent to distribute. The United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, affirmed. It held that the district court correctly balanced the sixth amendment’s rights to choice of counsel and to a defense by an attorney free of conflicts of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court violate Wheat’s Sixth Amendment right to his choice of counsel by refusing to permit Wheat’s additional counsel due to a possible conflict of interest?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice William Rehnquist, the Court held that the possible conflict of interest was sufficient to justify denying Wheat’s motion to take on Iredale as his attorney. Justice Rehnquist noted that the Sixth Amendment right to choice of counsel was limited in several ways; for example, a party could not hire a lawyer who had a previous or ongoing legal relationship with the opposing party. He also noted that the Court previously recognized that the representation of multiple defendants by the same lawyer created special dangers of conflict of interest, although it was not a per se constitutional violation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Wheat insisted that the waivers by all defendants cured any problems from multiple representations, Justice Rehnquist wrote that the federal courts had an independent interest in fair and ethical criminal trials. Justice Rehnquist reasoned that courts had the latitude to decline defendants’ waivers where the potential for a conflict of interest existed. Here, the persons Iredale wished to represent were allegedly three conspirators at various levels in a complex drug distribution operation, and there remained a possibility that either Bravo or Gomez-Barajas could be a witness at Wheat’s trial. Thus, Justice Rehnquist held that rejecting Wheat’s motion was within the district court’s discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented, joined by Justice William Brennan. He argued that the majority granted unwarranted deference to the district court’s discretion, and that the potential for a conflict of interest in the case did not outweigh Wheat’s Sixth Amendment right to his choice of counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented, joined by Justice Harry Blackmun. He emphasized that Wheat’s prior counsel planned to remain available to assist with his defense. Hence, the question was actually whether Wheat had the right to the additional counsel of his choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29619,"name":"John J.

It was also considering timber harvesting in the area. A study commissioned by the Forest Service reported that harvesting the Chimney Rock area would irreparably damage grounds that had historically been used by Native Americans to conduct religious rituals. After the Forest Service decided to construct a road, the Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association took action against Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the First Amendment\u0027s Free Exercise Clause prohibit the government from harvesting or developing the Chimney Rock area?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-3 decision, the Court held that the Forest Service was free to harvest the lands. Though the government\u0027s actions would have severe adverse effects on the Indians\u0027 practice oftheir religion, those effects were only incidental and did not constitute an attempt to coerce Native Americans to act in violation of their beliefs. The Court reasoned that government could not operate \"if it were required to satisfy every citizen\u0027s religious needs and desires,\" and that the First Amendment did not give any one group veto power over public programs that did not actually prohibit the free exercise of religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36287,"name":"Marilyn B.

When the girls were testifying against Coy, the court placed a large screen in front of him so that the girls would not have to see him. The jury proceeded to convict him. Coy argued that Iowa Code 910A, which provides for the use of a screen in child sexual abuse cases, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers face-to-face. He also claimed that the code violated his right to due process, since having a screen placed between him and the girls made him appear guilty before he was properly tried. The trial court dismissed these claims and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a defendant have the right to confront his alleged victims \"face-to-face\" under the Sixth Amendment if they testify against him before a jury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of a 6-2 court. The Sixth Amendment explicitly states that the accused has the right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" The Court maintained this \"confrontation is essential to fairness.\" The screen clearly disrupted this confrontation in a way that could have biased the trial. While acknowledging that \"face-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset the truthful rape victim or abused child,\" the Court insisted that \"by the same token it may confound and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult.\" A trial court cannot abridge the right to confrontation using a generalized law, and in Coy\u0027s case no specific reason was given for using a screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38220,"name":"Paul Papak","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/paul_papak","view_count":0,"last_name":"Papak","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"paul_papak"},"advocate_description":"by appointment of the Court, argued the cause for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14484"},{"advocate":{"ID":24894,"name":"Gorden E.

As part of the grand jury’s investigation, Doe was directed to produce records from bank holdings in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Doe proceeded to disclose some records but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination regarding any other documents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States then served subpoenas on three of Doe’s foreign banks, ordering them to release Doe’s information. The banks refused to release this information without Doe’s consent. The government then sought to have the district court order Doe to sign the bank forms authorizing his banks to release the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court refused, stating that Doe had not been indicted for any crime and that forcing him to disclose this information would amount to a “fishing expedition” for incriminating evidence; precisely the kind of action that the 5th Amendment sought to prevent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and ordered that Doe be held in contempt if he did not consent to the release of records. Doe refused and appealed. The Fifth Circuit again affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a court’s order that a citizen who has not yet been indicted by a grand jury must authorize the release of undisclosed foreign bank documents violate the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for an 8-1 majority, held that such a court order does not implicate the Fifth Amendment. First, he noted that it is undisputed that the contents of foreign bank accounts are not privileged under the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, the Fifth Amendment only protects individuals from being incriminated by their “own compelled testimonial communications.” The foreign bank statements, and the requisite authorization document, do not fit into this definition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court made further analogies to situations where a defendant may be required to give “incriminating” information without invoking the Fifth Amendment. These include: blood samples, lineups, handwriting samples, voice samples, or wearing particular clothing. Finally, the authorization in this case did not list specific information that the government needed for the case. Rather, this authorization simply gave the government the ability to search for the evidence without providing any information on any accounts, documents, banks, or other incriminating evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, made an argument distinguishing this situation from the other situations discussed by the Court.

ARM alleged that the Conferences participated in political activities in violation of U.S. laws governing tax-exempt organizations and that this participation created an unfair advantage over other, rule-abiding tax-exempt groups and infringed upon the plaintiffs’ ability to participate in the political process as voters. After the court granted the Conferences motion to be dismissed as parties to the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, ARM sought financial documents and other information from the Conferences to support their claims against the remaining defendants. When the Conferences refused to comply, the district court held them in civil contempt. On appeal, the Conferences contended that ARM lacked standing to bring its case against the government officials and, therefore, the court did not have the power to issue the contempt citation under Article III. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed and held that witnesses may challenge a contempt citation only on the grounds that the issuing court lacked jurisdiction to hear the underlying dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a nonparty witness challenge a civil contempt citation by challenging the court’s subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying lawsuit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy delivered the opinion for the 8-1 majority in which the Court reversed and remanded the appellate court’s ruling. The Court held that a nonparty witness may challenge the court’s jurisdiction over the underlying lawsuit in defense of a civil contempt citation. The Second Circuit’s jurisdiction standard impermissibly expanded the reach of judicial power because it permitted a court to act in issues without an actual case or controversy, as required by Article III of the Constitution. The Court also held that, because the judiciary may impose sanctions for the abuse of court processes, restricting a nonparty’s right to appeal a civil contempt citation is unnecessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall stated that he agreed with the Second Circuit’s concern that allowing a witness to raise subject matter jurisdiction challenges while appealing a contempt citation invited collusion with defendants who, unlike witnesses, lack a right to appeal interlocutory orders prior to a final judgment in the action. allowing a witness to raise subject matter jurisdiction challenges while appealing a contempt citation invited collusion with defendants who, unlike witnesses, lack a right to appeal interlocutory orders prior to a final judgment in the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33762,"name":"Kevin T.

This program led to a massive increase in the number of people who were denied continuance of their benefits. The respondents were three of those people who, in addition to pursuing remedies through the uniform appeal process, sued three high-ranking administrators of the CDR process in district court. The respondents argued that the government violated their Fifth Amendment rights to due process by adopting illegal polices that led to the wrongful termination of their benefits. Despite the Act’s explicit provision of a means for remedy, the respondents sought monetary damages for their emotional distress and loss of food. The district court dismissed the case and held that the government officials were protected from paying monetary damages by the doctrine of qualified immunity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that there might be enough facts to prove a violation of due process warranting monetary damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a government employee violates a citizen’s legal rights, should that citizen be allowed to pursue monetary damages as compensation, even when the violated statute does not contain monetary damages as a possible remedy in its remedial process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the respondents were not entitled to monetary damages because they were not mentioned in the extensive remedial options provided in the Social Security Disability Act (Act). The Court rejected the respondents’ argument that this case was analogous to \u003cem\u003eBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents\u003c/em\u003e, a case in which the Court ruled that, when a government actor violates a citizen’s legal right, federal courts may use any available remedy to make the wronged party whole. In \u003cem\u003eBivens\u003c/em\u003e there were no special circumstances preventing monetary damages, and Congress provided no legal redress in the statute. In this case, the Act provides an extensive remedial program in which Congress carefully considered the possibilities for remedy and specifically left out monetary damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurring opinion in which he disagreed with the majority opinion’s decision to ignore the Solicitor General’s argument that Congress had enacted a statute expressly requiring dismissal of this complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that Congressional silence on the monetary damages issue does not mean that the explicitly stated remedial process was intended to be the only source of remedy. He argued that legislators of “normal sensibilities” would have wanted some form of remedy for citizens wronged to the extent that respondents were. Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35187,"name":"Laurence H.

Among other requirements, AFLA beneficiaries had to involve religious and governmental agencies in dealing with the problems they faced. Over time, AFLA benefited several organizations with institutional ties to religious denominations. Chan Kendrick, on behalf of several federal taxpayers, clergymen, and the American Jewish Congress, challenged AFLA\u0027s constitutionality. On appeal from a ruling favoring Kendrick, the Supreme Court granted Bowen certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo AFLA\u0027s provisions, requiring its beneficiaries to involve both religious and governmental organizations in addressing the problems of teenage sexual relations, violate the First Amendment\u0027s Establishment Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that the \"advancement of religion\" was not AFLA\u0027s primary effect. Although it funded religious and other institutions without expressly prohibiting the use of such funds for religious purposes, AFLA required potential recipients to reveal what services they intended to provide and how they would provide them. Thus, the government could protect against the misuse of its funds. At the same time, however, such oversight did not create an \"excessive entanglement\" between church and state because AFLA merely authorized funding of religiously affiliated, rather than pervasively sectarian, organizations.

The amendment did not apply to religious, charitable, and education organizations because the city deemed that they were not centers of business activity. The New York State Club Association, a group of 125 clubs, contended in a state trial court that the new law violated its associational rights provided by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court ruled in favor of the city. A state appellate court and the New York Court of Appeals both affirmed, finding that the city\u0027s compelling interest in eliminating discrimination justified the restrictions on associational rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the City of New York violate First Amendment rights to free association when applying anti-discrimination laws to social clubs that were not \"distinctly private\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. The Court examined the clubs subjected to anti-discrimination laws closely and found \"no evidence of any club, let alone a substantial number of clubs, for whom the Law impairs the ability to associate or to advocate public or private viewpoints.\" In addition, many of the clubs showed characteristics of a public nature. Often strangers attended club functions, partook in meals, and made financial contributions. So long as the clubs were sufficiently open to this type of exposure to outsiders, the clubs could not be closed to certain types of people on account of their race, sex, or religion. Prohibiting this type of discrimination did not impair a club\u0027s ability to advance a viewpoint because clubs could still select people for membership based on whether they shared similar beliefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16552,"name":"Alan Mansfield","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/alan_mansfield","view_count":0,"last_name":"Mansfield","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"alan_mansfield"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14534"},{"advocate":{"ID":38472,"name":"Peter L.

The ordinance merely required Lakewood\u0027s mayor to provide an explanation, in the event of a permit denial, while empowering him to subject all permit approvals to whatever \"terms and conditions\" which he \"deemed necessary and reasonable.\" On appeal from a district court ruling that found the ordinance constitutional, the Court of Appeals reversed. The Supreme Court granted Lakewood\u0027s request for certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Lakewood\u0027s city ordinance violate freedom of speech rights as protected by the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that the licensing ordinance was facially invalid since it gave Lakewood\u0027s mayor unbridled discretion to discriminate against permit seekers, based on the content of their publications and viewpoints. This, in turn, promoted self-censorship by publishers and other speakers who sought to curry favor with the mayor\u0027s officer in order to secure the approval of their licensing requests. The Court added that while cities may require the periodic licensing of newsracks on public property, even subjecting such procedures to reasonable restrictions, they may not use language which is so open-ended as to give city officials unlimited subjective discretion over permit approvals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23409,"title":"Oral Argument - November 04, 1987","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23409"}],"citation":{"volume":"486","page":"750","year":"1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26969"},"decisions":[{"description":"Publishers can challenge the facial constitutionality of the city ordinance without first applying and being denied a permit.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15140,"name":"William J.

After the police caught up with him and drove alongside him for a short distance, they observed him discarding a number of packets. Assuming the packets contained cocaine, the police arrested Chesternut and, after a search of his person, discovered heroin and a hypodermic needle. Chesternut was charged with possession of controlled substances in violation of Michigan law. The trial court dismissed the charge and concluded that Chesternut was unlawfully seized during the police pursuit preceding his disposal of the packets. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed and held that Chesternut’s freedom was restricted as soon as the officers began their pursuit. Michigan appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a police officer violate the Fourth Amendment’s protection against seizures when he pursues a citizen without an objective basis for suspecting him of criminal activity? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court, which held the officers’ pursuit of Chesternut did not constitute a seizure prohibited by the Fourth Amendment; therefore the charges against him were improperly dropped. The test of whether a seizure violates the Fourth Amendment is based off whether a reasonable man would have concluded that the police had restrained his liberty so that he was not free to leave. Under the reasonable man standard, Chesternut was not seized before he discarded the drugs because a reasonable person would not conclude the police attempted to chase Chesternut simply by accelerating to catch up with him, followed by a short drive alongside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17084,"name":"Andrea L.

(Basic) was a publicly-traded company engaged in manufacturing related to the steel industry. Combustion, Inc. (Combustion), a similar company, had expressed interest in merging with Basic but had not done so because of antitrust concerns. Beginning in 1976, Combustion representatives had conversations with Basic representatives regarding the possibility of a merger. Throughout 1977 and 1978, Basic made several public statements denying rumors that these conversations were taking place. On December 18, 1978, Basic asked the New York Stock Exchange to suspend trading of its stocks because it had been approached about a merger, and on December 19 Basic’s board approved the offer from Combustion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe respondents in this case are former Basic stockholders who sold their stock after Basic’s first denial of merger conversations. They sued Basic and its director for making false or misleading statements in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, which has to do with material facts relating to the purchase or sale of stocks. The plaintiffs argued that these statements artificially depressed the market for Basic’s stock, which injured the sellers. The district court certified the plaintiffs as a class and granted summary judgment for the company. The court held that the statements were immaterial because the conversations were not necessarily destined to become a merger agreement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that a company cannot disclose misleading information and that the conversations, although they might not have been material on their own, became so because they made the company’s statements untrue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the statements in question meet the standard for materiality defined by Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the district court use the proper standard to certify the class?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion of the 4-2 plurality. The Supreme Court held that there was no reason to artificially exclude merger conversations from the definition of materiality simply because they do not include specific prices. Instead, the materiality of a fact depends on its significance to “the reasonable investor.” The Court also held that it was impractical to require individuals to show a specific reliance on misleading information within an impersonal market. Therefore, it is reasonable for courts to use a presumption of reliance for the purpose of adjudicating such cases, though the presumption can be rebutted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he argued that the majority opinion’s support for the presumption of reliance, or “fraud-on-the-market” theory, represented the Court taking a stance on economic policies that were beyond its purview. He also argued that, because Congress has not addressed the issue, the majority opinion should have refrained from doing so. Additionally, the facts of the case in question make it a poor candidate for such analysis because they indicate that the plaintiffs did not believe the supposedly misleading statements. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice William H.

Foster Winans wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) entitled \u003cem\u003eHeard on the Street\u003c/em\u003e (\u003cem\u003eHeard\u003c/em\u003e) in which he reported on up-and-coming stocks. In 1983, Winans entered into a scheme that entailed him sending information about the stocks to be featured in \u003cem\u003eHeard\u003c/em\u003e to two friends who worked at a brokerage firm. When \u003cem\u003eHeard\u003c/em\u003e featured a stock, it generally affected the actual price and quantity of the stock in the market. Over a four-month period, the brokers used Winans’ information regarding stocks yet to be featured in \u003cem\u003eHeard\u003c/em\u003e to make trades that resulted in profits of around $690,000. When the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, Winans and his co-conspirator Carpenter confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court found that Winans had breached the duty of confidentiality he owed the WSJ and found him and his co-conspirators guilty of mail and wire fraud as well as securities violations. The petitioners appealed and argued that, because the WSJ—the only alleged victim of the mail and wire fraud charges—had no interest in the stocks being traded, the conviction should be overturned. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the petitioners’ misappropriation of the upcoming publication schedule was sufficient to establish a case for mail and wire fraud. The Circuit court reasoned that the use of mail and wire services had a sufficient nexus to Winans\u0027 knowing breach of his duty of confidentiality he owed the WSJ and that this breach harmed the WSJ.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Can the petitioners be found guilty of securities crimes against the Wall Street Journal even though the Wall Street Journal had no interest in the securities traded?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the petitioners use mail and wire services as an essential part of their scheme to defraud the Wall Street Journal of its property?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Court was evenly divided as to whether or not the Wall Street Journal’s lack of interest in the securities traded cleared petitioners of the charged crimes, and because of that split, the Court deferred to the appellate court’s judgment. The Court unanimously rejected petitioners’ arguments that they did not obtain any money or property from the WSJ and therefore that the state did not prove the required elements of the mail and wire fraud statutes. The Court held that the publication schedule and the contents of the column while being intangible, were still property sufficient to warrant a conviction. In addition, the Court rejected petitioners’ arguments that Winans’ actions were simply a violation of workplace rules and could amount to defrauding. The Court determined that the dissemination of the column via mail and wire was an essential part of petitioners’ scheme, which satisfied the final element of the mail and wire fraud statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20619,"name":"Don D.

Since 1947, the legislature encouraged thinly populated school districts to reorganize themselves into larger districts; once reorganized, districts could only charge for transportation provisions with voter approval. Dickinson Public Schools chose not to participate in the reorganization. In 1973, the district began charging a fee for door-to-door bus service; about thirteen percent of students rode the bus, and the district charged their parents ninety-seven dollars a year for one child or one hundred fifty dollars a year for two children. In 1979, North Dakota enacted legislation expressly indicating that non-reorganized school districts could charge fees for transporting students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarita Kadrmas, her mother Paula, and the rest of her family lived about sixteen miles from Sarita’s school. In September 1985, the family’s annual income was at or near the poverty level. Until 1985, the Kadrmas family agreed each year to pay the busing fee for Sarita, but they refused to sign a contract for the 1985 school year and the bus no longer stopped for Sarita. The Kadrmas family then used private transportation, but the costs exceeded $1,000 per school year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn September 1985, Paula Kadrmas and other parents in the district filed an action in state court seeking to enjoin the Dickinson Public Schools and various school district officials from collecting any bus service fees. The district court rejected their action on the merits. On appeal to the Supreme Court of North Dakota, rejected Kadrmas’ argument that the busing fee violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It characterized the statute as purely economic legislation, concluding that the charges authorized by the statute were rationally related to the legitimate government objective of allocating limited resources. In the spring of 1987, while her appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States was pending, the Kadrmas family signed a busing contract for the remainder of the 1986 school year and paid part of the fee. They also signed a contract for the 1987 school year.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Was Kadrmas’ petition for a writ of certiorari barred because she was contracting for bus service with Dickinson Public Schools while her appeal was pending?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the application of a busing fee by Dickinson Public Schools deprive Sarita Kadrmas of a minimum access to education?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Did the application of a busing fee by Dickinson Public Schools to students at some but not all districts deprive students of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, no, and no. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the Court held that North Dakota’s statute allowing non-reorganized schools to charge busing fees did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice O’Connor first rejected the district’s contention that Kadrmas’ was barred from appeal because her daughter was enjoying the benefits of the district’s bus service. She noted that the legislature authorized bus service through a different statute, and characterized the fee as a burden to Kadrmas, not a benefit. She also held that the case was not moot, in part because a decision in Kadrmas’ favor would relieve them from future assessments for bus service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice O’Connor interpreted Kadrmas’ argument to mean that the busing fee unconstitutionally placed a greater obstacle to education on poorer families. Justice O’Connor disagreed that the Court must subject the statute to heightened scrutiny, in part because the government did not penalize Sarita for her parents’ conduct. Justice O’Connor also rejected Kadrmas’ argument that North Dakota was constitutionally barred from withholding bus services from those unable to pay because those services were especially important. Unlike court access and court remedies, North Dakota did not maintain a legal or practical monopoly on the means of transporting children to school. Moreover, the Kadrmas family could and did find a private alternative to the public school bus service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice O’Connor also held that the statute did not violate equal protection by only allowing fees for bus service in non-reorganized schools. She wrote that Kadrmas failed to demonstrate that the statute was both arbitrary and irrational. The purpose of the statute was to encourage reorganization through the expansion of districts’ tax bases, and the fees existed to encourage voters to approve school district reorganization. She noted that voters in reorganized districts could approve bus service fees as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented, joined by Justice William Brennan. He characterized the majority’s ruling as a retreat from the promise of equal education opportunity. He argued that North Dakota’s actions placed a special burden on poor families in their pursuit of education and discriminated on the basis of economic status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented, joined by Justice Harry Blackmun. He argued that once voters in a district decided whether or not to reorganize, there was no longer a rational basis for denying free bus transportation to students in that particular district.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23382,"title":"Oral Argument - March 30, 1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23382"}],"citation":{"volume":"487","page":"450","year":"1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27004"},"decisions":[{"description":"Appellants are not estopped from raising an equal protection challenge to the statute that authorizes the fee Appellees charge.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15092,"name":"Sandra Day O\u0027Connor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sandra_day_oconnor","view_count":0,"last_name":"O\u0027Connor","roles":[{"id":2736,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":370242000,"date_end":1138687200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2736"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32763,"mime":"image/png","size":49563,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/sandra_day_oconnor/sandra_day_oconnor.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":8894,"identifier":"sandra_day_oconnor"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"majority","seniority":7,"ideology":1.571,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/207768"},{"member":{"ID":15141,"name":"William H.

First, Justice O\u0027Connor argued that the prohibition on signs failed to meet the high standards that the Court uses when evaluating the content-based regulation of political speech in a public forum. The \"dignity\" standard that the Code used was similar to the \"outrageousness\" standard which the Court found unconstitutional in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988) because it was too subjective. Second, O\u0027Connor reasoned that since the language of the ban on congregations was narrowly drawn and could only be acted upon by the police in situations where a threat to security or peace were present, it did not prohibit peaceful gatherings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23336,"title":"Oral Argument - November 09, 1987","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23336"}],"citation":{"volume":"485","page":"312","year":"1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27007"},"decisions":[{"description":"District of Columbia Code § 22-1115\u0027s display clause facially violates the First Amendment.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15092,"name":"Sandra Day O\u0027Connor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sandra_day_oconnor","view_count":0,"last_name":"O\u0027Connor","roles":[{"id":2736,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":370242000,"date_end":1138687200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2736"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32763,"mime":"image/png","size":49563,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/sandra_day_oconnor/sandra_day_oconnor.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":8894,"identifier":"sandra_day_oconnor"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"plurality","seniority":7,"ideology":1.571,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/207633"},{"member":{"ID":15060,"name":"John Paul Stevens","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/john_paul_stevens","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stevens","roles":[{"id":2704,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":188200800,"date_end":1277787600,"appointing_president":"Gerald Ford","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2704"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32732,"mime":"image/png","size":62101,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/john_paul_stevens/john_paul_stevens.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":12611,"identifier":"john_paul_stevens"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"none","joining":[{"ID":15092,"name":"Sandra Day O\u0027Connor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sandra_day_oconnor","view_count":0,"last_name":"O\u0027Connor","roles":[{"id":2736,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":370242000,"date_end":1138687200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2736"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32763,"mime":"image/png","size":49563,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/sandra_day_oconnor/sandra_day_oconnor.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":8894,"identifier":"sandra_day_oconnor"}],"seniority":6,"ideology":-0.546,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/207634"},{"member":{"ID":15049,"name":"Antonin Scalia","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/antonin_scalia","view_count":0,"last_name":"Scalia","roles":[{"id":2693,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":528094800,"date_end":1455343200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2693"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32678,"mime":"image/png","size":58944,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/antonin_scalia/antonin_scalia.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":10732,"identifier":"antonin_scalia"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"none","joining":[{"ID":15092,"name":"Sandra Day O\u0027Connor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sandra_day_oconnor","view_count":0,"last_name":"O\u0027Connor","roles":[{"id":2736,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":370242000,"date_end":1138687200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2736"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32763,"mime":"image/png","size":49563,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/sandra_day_oconnor/sandra_day_oconnor.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":8894,"identifier":"sandra_day_oconnor"}],"seniority":8,"ideology":1.64,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/207635"},{"member":{"ID":15140,"name":"William J.

Shapero directed the letter at individuals who were about to lose their houses to foreclosure.  The Commission found nothing false or misleading with the letter, but denied approval under a Kentucky Supreme Court rule, which prohibited direct mail advertisements “precipitated by a specific event” such as foreclosure.  Shapero then sought an advisory opinion from the Kentucky Bar Association’s Committee on Legal Ethics.  The committee upheld the Advertising Commission’s ruling.  On review, the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a Kentucky Supreme Court rule prohibiting direct mail advertisements by attorneys to prospective clients, even when there is no false or misleading information, violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 6-3 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion, holding the Kentucky Supreme Court rule unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court did not decide whether Shapero’s letter required First Amendment protections.  The Court remanded the case for further consideration of that issue.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a concurrence, stating that the question of whether Shapero’s letter required First Amendment protections should be left to state courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20715,"name":"Donald L.

In response, the city of Brookfield, Wisconsin passed a law against all picketing in front of residential homes except for labor disputes. Following the advice of the town attorney, the city amended the law to ban labor picketing as well. The stated purpose of the law was \"the protection and preservation of the home.\" When enacted, Schultz and Braun stopped picketing and filed suit in federal district court, claiming that the law violated the First Amendment. The court declared it would issue a permanent injunction against the law unless it was narrowed in scope. The United States Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit affirmed that the law violated the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a city ordinance prohibiting picketing in front of residential homes violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor delivered the opinion for a 6-3 court. The Court held that since the street constituted a traditional public forum, the ban must satisfy strict standards in order to remain. Since the ban is \"content neutral,\" \"leaves open ample alternative channels of communication,\" and serves a \"significant government interest,\" the Court ruled that it passed the strict standards and could remain. The city government had a legitimate purpose in protecting the homes of its residents, and did so without favoring one idea over another or eliminating the ability to communicate an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23373,"title":"Oral Argument - April 20, 1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23373"}],"citation":{"volume":"487","page":"474","year":"1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27017"},"decisions":[{"description":"The state ordinance is facially valid under the First Amendment because it is content neutral and serves a legitimate government interest.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15092,"name":"Sandra Day O\u0027Connor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sandra_day_oconnor","view_count":0,"last_name":"O\u0027Connor","roles":[{"id":2736,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":370242000,"date_end":1138687200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2736"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32763,"mime":"image/png","size":49563,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/sandra_day_oconnor/sandra_day_oconnor.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":8894,"identifier":"sandra_day_oconnor"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"majority","seniority":7,"ideology":1.571,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/207035"},{"member":{"ID":15141,"name":"William H.

The arresting officer read him his Miranda rights, and Roberson asked to see an attorney before answering any questions. On April 19, while Roberson was still in custody on the burglary charge, a different officer, who was unaware that Roberson had requested counsel, interrogated him regarding a robbery that happened on April 15. During this questioning, Roberson gave an incriminating statement. At trial, the trial court suppressed the statement and held that his interrogation without his attorney present after he had requested one violated his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed, and the Arizona Supreme Court denied the petition for review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the interrogation of a suspect after he has requested counsel regarding a separate investigation violate the defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion for the 6-2 majority. The Supreme Court held that, once a suspect has requested counsel, police cannot interrogate him unless he initiates the contact. The Fifth Amendment and the Supreme Court’s previous rulings on it are meant to serve as a bright-line rule for police officers. The Court also held that Roberson’s request for counsel was because of his discomfort with answering the police’s questions, and there is no reason to assume that discomfort would be case-specific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy argued that a suspect does not need to be made aware of his Miranda rights more than once. When he has been told that he has the right to an attorney, he can choose whether or not to invoke that right in any investigation. Justice Kennedy argued that the majority created an unnecessary dichotomy between always allowing such statements or always excluding them, when in fact there should be a balance that depends on the situations in each case. This approach would protect law enforcement’s ability to investigate and the suspect’s rights. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17605,"name":"Bruce M.

The statute of limitations on suits seeking to establish paternity was six years from the birth of the illegitimate child. However, the state allowed legitimate children to seek support from their parents at any time. Cherlyn Clark sought child support from Gene Jeter, whom she claimed was the father of her daughter, Tiffany. Blood tests indicated that there was a 99.3% probability that Jeter indeed was Tiffany\u0027s father. A state court dismissed Clark\u0027s suit because it was initiated after the statute of limitations had expired.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Pennsylvania law violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that the statute violated the Constitution. Citing the test which the Court developed in Mills v. Habluetzel (1982) to evaluate equal protection challenges to statutes of limitations in paternity suits, Justice O\u0027Connor held that the Pennsylvania law did not \"provide a reasonable opportunity to assert a claim on behalf of an illegitimate child.\" Furthermore, since, in some circumstances, Pennsylvania permitted paternity suits involving illegitimate children to be initiated after six years, there was no reason why the law in question was necessary to deter the litigation of \"stale or fraudulent claims,\" a legitimate state interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23353,"title":"Oral Argument - April 19, 1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23353"}],"citation":{"volume":"486","page":"456","year":"1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27032"},"decisions":[{"description":"Pennsylvania\u0027s 6-year statute of limitations for paternity suits violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15092,"name":"Sandra Day O\u0027Connor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sandra_day_oconnor","view_count":0,"last_name":"O\u0027Connor","roles":[{"id":2736,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":370242000,"date_end":1138687200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2736"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32763,"mime":"image/png","size":49563,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/sandra_day_oconnor/sandra_day_oconnor.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":8894,"identifier":"sandra_day_oconnor"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"majority","seniority":7,"ideology":1.571,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/206982"},{"member":{"ID":15141,"name":"William H.

On April 17, 1985, Guy Rufus Huddleston contacted a business owner in Michigan and offered to sell her a large number of blank videocassette tapes for significantly under market value. Huddleston was later charged with possessing and selling stolen videocassette tapes across state lines. At trial, the government presented evidence that Huddleston had previously trafficked in stolen goods. In response, Huddleston argued that he had not known any of the goods were stolen. The district court then instructed the jury that the evidence of prior bad acts could only be used to establish Huddleston’s knowledge, not to prove his character. The jury convicted Huddleston for possession of stolen goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit initially reversed the conviction and held that the government failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the goods in the prior instances were in fact stolen. The Court of Appeals granted a rehearing and subsequently affirmed the conviction, holding that the government only needs to meet a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust a court make a preliminary ruling on whether the prosecution has proven that the defendant is guilty of “similar acts” by a preponderance of the evidence before submitting such character evidence to the jury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the unanimous court. The Supreme Court held that requiring the trial court to make a preliminary ruling before admitting character evidence is contrary to Article IV of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Character evidence must meet the relevancy requirements of Rules 401-403. To add additional limitations would unnecessarily increase the burden on the prosecution and conflict with the legislative intent behind the rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20829,"name":"Don Ferris","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/don_ferris","view_count":0,"last_name":"Ferris","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"don_ferris"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21718"},{"advocate":{"ID":44079,"name":"William C.

The statute removed the federal income tax exemption for interest earned on publicly offered long-term bonds issued by state and local governments unless they were issued in registered form. South Carolina declared that both bearer and registered bonds issued by states and municipalities had been free from taxation since Pollock v. Farmer\u0027s Loan and Trust Co (1895). The federal government claimed that the Act did not eliminate the state\u0027s power to issue bonds free from taxation; rather it regulated the types of bonds to be exempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the TEFRA violate the Tenth Amendment and intergovernmental tax immunity?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that its subsequent decisions overruled Pollock so that state bond interest is not immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax. Therefore, the owners of state bonds have no constitutional authority to exempt taxes on the earned income. TEFRA imposes no direct tax on the states; it is only collected from bondholders. The Act is nondiscriminatory because the regulations are imposed on the federal government as well as the state governments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23356,"title":"Oral Argument - December 07, 1987","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23356"}],"citation":{"volume":"485","page":"505","year":"1988","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27040"},"decisions":[{"description":"Section 310(b)(1) does not violate the Tenth Amendment by effectively compelling States to issue bonds in registered form.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15140,"name":"William J.
