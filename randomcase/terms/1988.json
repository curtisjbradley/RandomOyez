Texas Monthly, Inc, a nonreligious publisher, claimed that this promoted religion in violation of the First Amendment\u0027s Establishment Clause. Texas Monthly filed suit in a state court seeking to recover the taxes it had paid in 1985. The court ruled that the exemption violated the Establishment Clause by advancing religion and the Free Press Clause by discriminating based on the content of publications. Since the court did not have the authority to rewrite tax statutes, it instead invalidated taxes levied on nonreligious publications and ordered the state to refund Texas Monthly\u0027s tax payments. A state appeals court reversed the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state violate the Establishment Clause and the Free Press Clause by exempting religious publications from paying taxes that all nonreligious publications must pay?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. delivered the judgment for 6-3 court a wrote a plurality opinion joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Thurgood Marshall. In the Brennan\u0027s view, the Texas government \"directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations\" by providing the exemption. The Court referred to its decision in \u003cem\u003eLemon v. Kurtzman\u003c/em\u003e, which required legislation affecting religion to have a secular purpose. In this case, the exemption did not have a secular purpose since it could not \"reasonably be seen as removing a significant state-imposed deterrent to the free exercise of religion.\" Since taxing religious publications did not inhibit the exercise of religion, a state could not singularly remove taxes for religious publications while still taxing nonreligious publications. This would use state mechanisms to give religious publishers an advantage over nonreligious publishers in violation of the Establishment Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39347,"name":"Roger J.

Mansell and Gaye M. Mansell were married for 23 years until their marriage ended in 1979. Major Mansell received both Air Force retirement pay and, pursuant to a portion of that pay, disability benefits. Under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act, military retirement payments were considered community property that were to be divided evenly between the spouses based on the extent of military service performed during the marriage. Major Mansell asked the California Superior Court to modify the divorce decree by removing the provision asking him to share his retirement pay. That court denied the request without opinion. Major Mansell appealed and the California Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s decision. The California Supreme Court denied the petition for review and Major Mansell appealed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e Under the Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act, can state courts treat military retirement pay that was waived by the retiree in order to receive veterans’ disability benefits as something divisible upon divorce? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court reversed the judgement and held that the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u0027 Protection Act exempted that portion of the retirement pay that a service member waived in order to receive disability benefits from the amount divisible upon divorce. While recognizing potential inequities to former spouses, the Court reasoned that the clear language of the statute could not be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20690,"name":"Dennis A.

(Bonito), a Florida corporation, developed a design for a fiberglass recreational boat and made a model to produce the finished fiberglass boats for sale. No patent application was ever filed for protection. In 1983, the Florida Legislature enacted a statute making it unlawful to use a direct modeling process to duplicate and sell a vessel or part of a vessel. In 1984, Bonito sued Thunder Craft Boats, Inc. (Thunder Craft), a Tennessee corporation, in the Florida district court for violating the statute. Thunder Craft successfully argued that the Florida statute conflicted with federal patent laws and was therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Eleventh Amendment. The Florida Court of Appeals and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s conclusion that the Florida law interfered with federal patent laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state statute, which prohibits the use of the direct molding process of a vessel that does not have patent protection and the sale of the duplicates, conflict with the federal patent law and therefore make it invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Eleventh Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court, which held that, under the Federal Constitution’s Supremacy Clause of the Eleventh Amendment, the federal patent system prevents the Florida statute. The Florida statute offered patent-like protection for ideas deemed unprotected under the federal patent system. This protection restricted the public’s ability to use unpatented designs, which conflicted with the free competition in ideas without patent protection that the federal patent system supported. Therefore, this Florida statute entered into a field of regulation that the patent laws have reserved for Congress, and Congress had declined to exercise. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43226,"name":"Tomas Morgan Russell","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/tomas_morgan_russell","view_count":0,"last_name":"Russell","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"tomas_morgan_russell"},"advocate_description":"For Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14558"},{"advocate":{"ID":19396,"name":"Charles E.

When the FBI refused the request, a CBS news correspondent and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP) challenged the denial as a violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). RCFP claimed that since Medico was an identified organized crime figure with corrupt ties to a United States Congressman, Medico\u0027s criminal record was a matter of \"public record\" and \"interest.\" On appeal from an unfavorable appellate decision, the Supreme Court granted the U.S. Department of Justice certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a refusal to disclose an individual\u0027s personal FBI crime record to a third party justifiable under the \"personal privacy\" invasion exemption of the Freedom of Information Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that an individual\u0027s interest in nondisclosure of any criminal records that the FBI might have on him or her is precisely the sort of \"personal privacy\" that Congress intended to protect when it enacted FOIA exemptions. Balancing public knowledge interests against privacy considerations, the Court explained that RCFP\u0027s request was overly broad. The request sought access to all FBI records on Medico, rather than specific information concerning his file. Moreover, the Court stated that public interest in criminal record information is not increased simply because the requesting party is a news agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39134,"name":"Roy T.

He had been driving at high speeds in an effort to elude the police. The police placed an 18-wheel truck across both lanes of a highway and behind a blind curve so that Caldwell could not see it as he approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Caldwell’s death, his heirs—including Georgia Brower, the administrator of his estate—sued the police in district court and alleged that such a roadblock constituted excessive force and violated the Fourth Amendment. The district court dismissed the case, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a police roadblock constitute an illegal seizure under the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that a Fourth Amendment violation occurs when the police intentionally acquire physical control of a person or possessions. In this case, the violation occurred because Caldwell clearly intended to continue driving, and the police actions intended to forcibly stop his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred in judgment. He argued that the majority’s opinion established a test for Fourth Amendment violations based on police intent. However, since not every Fourth Amendment violation is intentional, this test could not be used to decide all Fourth Amendment cases. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the opinion concurring in judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38103,"name":"Philip W.

The statute\u0027s preamble indicated that \"[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,\" and the law codified the following restrictions: public employees and public facilities were not to be used in performing or assisting abortions unnecessary to save the mother\u0027s life; encouragement and counseling to have abortions was prohibited; and physicians were to perform viability tests upon women in their twentieth (or more) week of pregnancy. Lower courts struck down the restrictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Missouri restrictions unconstitutionally infringe upon the right to privacy or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a controversial and highly fractured decision, the Court held that none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri legislation were unconstitutional. First, the Court held that the preamble had not been applied in any concrete manner for the purposes of restricting abortions, and thus did not present a constitutional question. Second, the Court held that the Due Process Clause did not require states to enter into the business of abortion, and did not create an affirmative right to governmental aid in the pursuit of constitutional rights. Third, the Court found that no case or controversy existed in relation to the counseling provisions of the law. Finally, the Court upheld the viability testing requirements, arguing that the State\u0027s interest in protecting potential life could come into existence before the point of viability. The Court emphasized that it was not revisiting the essential portions of the holding in Roe v. Wade.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24566,"name":"Frank Susman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/frank_susman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Susman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"frank_susman"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14585"},{"advocate":{"ID":18942,"name":"Charles Fried","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/charles_fried","view_count":0,"last_name":"Fried","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"charles_fried"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging reversal","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14586"},{"advocate":{"ID":46516,"name":"William L.

Sable Communications had been in the dial-a-porn business since 1983. A judge in District Court upheld the ban on obscene messages, but enjoined the Act\u0027s enforcement against indecent ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the amended Communications Act violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court upheld the District Court\u0027s ruling. Since the First Amendment does not protect obscene speech, as the Court found in Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton (1973), the ban on obscene speech was legitimate. However, sexual expression that is simply indecent is protected. Thus, banning adult access to indecent messages \"far exceeds that which is necessary\" to shield minors from dial-a-porn services.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40639,"name":"Richard G.

Christmas pageant. Upon completion, delivery, and joining of the work to a base that it prepared separately, CCNV paid Reid the final installment of the agreed-upon price. Shortly thereafter, the parties filed competing copyright claims over the sculpture. Holding, in accordance with the Copyright Act of 1976 (the \"Act\"), that the statue was a \"work made for hire,\" a district court ruled in favor of CCNV. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and the Supreme Court granted CCNV certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the making of a sculpture for an organization, by someone who contracts with the organization but is not its employee, a \"work made for hire\" as defined by the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. Section 101?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion, the Court held that the statue\u0027s preparation was not a \"work for hire\" as defined by the Act because Reid was not a CCNV employee. Instead, CCNV hired Reid as an independent contractor.

The decrees were approved by a federal district court. Years later, Robert K. Wilks, a white firefighter, challenged the decrees and alleged that whites were being denied promotions in favor of less qualified blacks. Wilks argued that such practices violated Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The personnel board agreed that it was making race-conscious decisions but argued it was doing so pursuant to the original decrees. The Court combined arguments in two companion cases: Personnel Board v. Wilks and Arrington v. Wilks.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Wilks and other white firefighters have a constitutional right to challenge the previously established decrees?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that because \"a person cannot be deprived of his legal rights in a proceeding to which he is not a party,\" the white firefighters were not precluded from challenging employment decisions taken pursuant to the consent decrees. The Court argued that \"[t]he parties to a lawsuit presumably know better than anyone else the nature and scope of relief sought in the action\" and that they were better suited to intervene when their rights were immediately threatened. Conversely, the Court noted that \"[n]o one can seriously contend that an employer might successfully defend against a Title VII claim by one group of employees on the ground that its actions were required by an earlier decree entered in a suit brought against it by another, if the later group did not have adequate notice or knowledge of the earlier suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43047,"name":"Thomas W.

(ATA) challenged the flat tax portion of Arkansas\u0027 Highway Use Equalization (HUE) tax, alleging that it violated the Commerce Clause. The Arkansas Supreme Court, relying on Supreme Court precedent, rejected this claim. Subsequently, on June 23, 1987, the Supreme Court decided American Trucking Ass\u0027ns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U.S. 266 (1987), which held that state application of flat highway use taxes was unconstitutional. Pending re-hearing in the Arkansas Supreme Court, Justice Blackmun ordered, in August 1987, that all new taxes collected be kept in escrow. Subsequently, the Arkansas Supreme Court held that HUE was unconstitutional, but that Scheiner did not apply retroactively. The court went on to decide that taxes already collected for the tax year beginning July 1, 1987, could remain in the state treasury, but that those funds placed in the escrow account ordered by Justice Blackmun should be refunded, as they had not been spent or budgeted for future spending.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the Court\u0027s decision in Scheiner apply retroactively? (2) Even if the Scheiner decision does not apply retroactively, can the state keep taxes collected before the escrow account was established when those taxes are for the tax year July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988, a period after Scheiner?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. A plurality of the Court held that Scheiner did not apply retroactively, and that state collection of taxes for the tax year beginning July 1, 1987, before the establishment of the escrow account, was unconstitutional. Applying the test of non-retroactivity articulated in Chevron Oil v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97 (1971), the Court found that Scheiner clearly established a new principle of law; that the purpose of the Commerce Clause did not support retroactive application; and that equitable considerations weighed heavily against retroactivity. The Court went on to reverse the Arkansas Supreme Court\u0027s decision not to refund taxes already collected for the tax year beginning July 1, 1987, reasoning that the conduct to which Scheiner applied prospectively was the use of the highway, not the payment of money therefor. Justice Scalia concurred in the result, but disagreed with the plurality\u0027s retroactivity analysis. He found that the only reason to follow Scheiner, which he believed to be wrongly decided, was the doctrine of stare decisis, which only applies prospectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16836,"name":"A.

He sustained multiple injuries, including broken teeth and a sprained finger, and claimed to have suffered great mental anguish and distress as a result of the arrest and actions of the police. Twenty-two months after the incident occurred, Okure sued the two State University of New York (SUNY) police officers under 42 U.S.C. 1983. The officers moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the statute of limitations for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution is one year under New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. The trial court denied the motion by stating that New York\u0027s general statute of limitations for personal injury actions is three years.

He was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $5,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States then brought additional civil charges under the False Claims Act, which authorized it to collect $2000 for each offense in addition to attorney\u0027s fees and twice the damages sustained. In this case the actual damages were just $585, but because of the number of offenses the total penalty was more than $130,000. The District Court, however, ruled that the penalty was \"entirely unrelated\" to the government\u0027s actual damages and would therefore be a second punishment for the same offense, violating the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The penalty was therefore limited to double the amount of actual damages and attorney\u0027s fees. The government appealed the decision directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhere the penalty authorized under the False Claims Act is \"entirely unrelated\" to the damages actually suffered by the government, does imposition of the penalty amount to a \"punishment\" governed by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the 5th Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Harry Blackmun, on behalf of a unanimous Supreme Court, wrote that while previous cases had held penalties under the Act to be civil in nature, that did not foreclose the possibility of the penalty being so extreme and so unrelated to the actual damages as to constitute \"punishment.\" Because Halper had already been jailed and fined, additional punishment in a separate proceeding would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court remanded the case to the District Court so that the government could challenge the original assessment of its attorney\u0027s fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35719,"name":"Michael R.

Upon arrival, the officers found Harris sitting on the floor of the patrol wagon. They asked if she needed medical attention, and she responded incoherently. Inside the station, Harris twice slumped to the floor, and the officers eventually left her lying on the floor. She received no medical care. An hour later, Harris was released and taken to a nearby hospital in an ambulance her family provided. Harris was diagnosed with various emotional conditions and hospitalized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris sued the city of Canton for violating her Fourteenth Amendment right to Due Process by denying her medical attention when she was in police custody. At the jury trial in federal district court, evidence indicated that the decision to provide medical attention is left to the discretion of shift managers who had not received adequate training on this subject. The jury found in favor of Harris. The city appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the judgment and remanded the case because of unclear jury instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a municipality liable for failure to provide adequate training to an employee that resulted in a deprivation of constitutional rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White wrote the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that municipalities may be liable for inadequate training of employees, but only when “the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference” to the constitutional rights of the people with whom the employees will interact. A municipality is then only liable when the failure to train is a deliberate choice on the part of the city. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. makes clear that the Court of Appeals may remand the case for a new trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor agreed with the majority’s holding regarding the municipality’s liability for a conscious failure to train. However, she argued that it was unnecessary to remand the case to the Court of Appeals. The Court should simply apply the “deliberate indifference” standard to the facts of the case. Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined in Justice O’Connor’s opinion. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21464,"name":"David Rudovsky","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/david_rudovsky","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rudovsky","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"david_rudovsky"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14700"},{"advocate":{"ID":19760,"name":"Carter G.

He entered the store and saw a line of four or five persons at the counter; not wanting to wait in line, he quickly left the store and returned to Berry’s car. Officer M.S.

Berry and Officer Connor stopped Graham, and he sat down on the curb. He soon passed out; when he revived he was handcuffed and lying face down on the sidewalk. Several more police officers were present by this time. The officers picked up Graham, still handcuffed, and placed him over the hood of Berry’s car. Graham attempted to reach for his wallet to show his diabetic identification, and an officer shoved his head down into the hood and told him to shut up. The police then struggled to place Graham in the squad car over Graham’s vigorous resistance. Officer Connor soon determined, however, that Graham had not committed a crime at the convenience store, and returned him to his home. Graham sustained multiple injuries, including a broken foot, as a result of the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham filed § 1983 charges against Connor, other officers, and the City of Charlotte, alleging a violation of his rights by the excessive use of force by the police officers, unlawful assault, unlawful restraint constituting false imprisonment, and that the City of Charlotte improperly trained its officers in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The City of Charlotte filed for a directed verdict, which the district court granted. Graham appealed the ruling on the use of excessive force, contending that the district court incorrectly applied a four-part substantive due process test from \u003ci\u003eJohnson v. Glick\u003c/i\u003e that takes into account officers’ “good faith” efforts and whether they acted “maliciously or sadistically”. He instead argued for a standard of “objective reasonableness” under the Fourth Amendment. The United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, rejected this argument, reasoning that concepts such as \"good faith\" are relevant to determining the degree of force used. It affirmed the directed verdict, holding that a reasonable jury could not have found in Graham’s favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Must Graham show that the police acted “maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm” to establish his claim that Charlotte police used excessive force?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Must Graham’s claim that law enforcement officials used excessive force be examined under the Fourth Amendment’s “objective reasonableness” standard?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and yes. In a unanimous ruling written by Justice William Rehnquist, the Court held that claims of excessive force used by government officials are properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment’s “objective reasonableness” standard. The Court vacated the directed verdict and remanded the case to the district court to be decided by that standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRehnquist noted that § 1983 is not itself a source of substantive rights, but rather a means for vindicating federal rights conferred elsewhere. Rather, the Fourth Amendment stands as one of the two primary sources of protection against physically abusive government conduct, along with the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, the validity of Graham’s claim must be judged by reference to the specific rights conferred by the Fourth Amendment, not by a generalized “excessive force” standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Rehnquist rejected Connor’s argument that “malicious and sadistic” is merely another way of describing conduct that is objectively unreasonable, noting that the subjective motivations of the officers are relevant under the Eighth Amendment, not the Fourth. Rather, he explained that the “objective reasonableness” of a use of force should be judged by the perspective of an officer on the scene, and should take into account factors such as the severity of the crime, the threat posed by the suspect, and any attempts by the suspect to resist or evade arrest. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Harry Blackmun, William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall concurred, in an opinion written by Justice Blackmun. Justice Blackmun argued that there was not sufficient precedent to hold that claims of use of excessive force will never be subject to Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26643,"name":"H.

The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida made Paul Nordberg the trustee in bankruptcy. In 1985, Nordberg sued Granfinanciera, S.A. and Medex, Ltda. in district court. Nordberg alleged that they received $1.7 million in fraudulent transfers from Chase \u0026amp; Sanborn’s corporate predecessor a year before the bankruptcy filing. The district court referred the proceedings to bankruptcy court. Five months later, after the Colombian government nationalized Granfinanciera, Granfinanciera and Medex requested a jury trial. The bankruptcy court denied the request because fraudulent transfers were a non-jury issue under English common law. After a bench trial, the bankruptcy court dismissed the actual fraud claim but found in favor of Nordberg on the constructive fraud claim in the amount of $1,500,000 against Granfinanciera and $180,000 against Medex. The district court affirmed the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed and held that Granfinanciera and Medex did not have a statutory right to a jury trial, nor did they have a right under the Seventh Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a person who has submitted a claim against a bankruptcy estate have a right to a jury trial when sued by the trustee in bankruptcy to recover an allegedly fraudulent money transfer?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the Seventh Amendment protected the right to a trial by jury in all cases in which a legal right, as opposed to an equitable right, was at issue. Since this case deals with the recovery of money, it is purely a legal issue. Under English common law, such a case would have received a jury trial as well. The Court also held that Congress may only legislate away the right to a trial by jury in cases where “public rights” are litigated. The Court declined to address Nordberg’s argument that Granfinanciera was barred from a jury trial because it was an agent of the Colombian government since the issue was not addressed in the lower courts, and this was not an exceptional case where the Court could overlook the lack of lower court discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He argued that “public rights” can only refer to situations where the government is involved. Because previous Supreme Court decisions had linked the idea of public rights with a waiver of sovereign immunity, which is only available to the government, public rights can only be at issue when the government is involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissent, Justice Byron R. White argued that the majority’s opinion inappropriately overrules a previous decision that Congress can establish an alternative adjudication to a jury trial in a bankruptcy proceeding. The Seventh Amendment does not apply to all federal proceedings, specifically bankruptcy, which Congress has assigned to specialized courts. He also argued that there was no evidence to suggest such a case would have received a jury trial rather than a chancery trial according to English common law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun dissented and argued that Congress has the right to establish alternative adjudication procedures in certain cases. Since a bankruptcy trial often requires expert knowledge, a jury might be detrimental to the proceedings, and therefore Congress had every right to fashion a modern bankruptcy system. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35187,"name":"Laurence H.

Although Hopkins secured a $25 million government contract that year, the board decided to put her proposal on hold for the following year.  The next year, when Price Waterhouse refused to re-propose her for partnership, she sued under Title VII for sex discrimination.  Of 622 partners at Price Waterhouse, 7 were women.  The partnership selection process relied on recommendations by other partners, some of whom openly opposed women in advanced positions, but Hopkins also had problems with being overly aggressive and not getting along with office staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court held that Price Waterhouse had discriminated, but Hopkins was not entitled to full damages because her poor interpersonal skills also contributed to the board’s decision.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, but held that the employer is not liable if it can show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same employment decision in the absence of discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Court of Appeals err in requiring the employer to prove it would have made the same employment decision in the absence of discrimination by clear and convincing evidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes in part.  In a 6-3 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the plurality opinion reversing the lower court and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that the court of appeals applied the right test, but should have placed the burden at “preponderance of the evidence” not “clear and convincing evidence”.  On remand, Price Waterhouse would escape liability if it shows it would have denied Hopkins partnership even if she were not a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a concurrence, stating that there was no requirement for the employer to submit objective evidence.  The employer’s credible testimony alone was enough.

Morash, the president of the Yankee Bank for Finance and Savings (Bank). Massachusetts alleged that, by failing to compensate two terminated employees for vacation time they accrued but did not use, Morash violated the Massachusetts Payment of Wages Statute (Statute). Massachusetts alleged the statute was pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA requires an employer to pay a discharged employee his full wages, including holiday or vacation payments, on date of discharge. The trial judge certified the preemption question to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts transferred the case to its docket on its own initiative and held that the policy constituted an employee welfare benefit plan and that the statute was pre-empted by ERISA.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does a company’s policy of paying its discharged employees for their unused vacation time constitute an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does ERISA’s broad pre-emption provision foreclose a criminal action to enforce that policy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, no. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court which held that a policy of paying discharged employees for their unused vacation time does not constitute an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA, and that ERISA’s provisions do not foreclose a criminal action to enforce that policy. The employment welfare benefit plan is not meant to relate to ordinary vacation pay, but rather to include vacation benefit funds that accumulate over a period of time. The bank payment is not an employee welfare benefit plan just because the employees did not use their vacation days prior to their termination.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28898,"name":"Jason Berger","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jason_berger","view_count":0,"last_name":"Berger","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jason_berger"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14728"},{"advocate":{"ID":20259,"name":"Carl Valvo","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/carl_valvo","view_count":0,"last_name":"Valvo","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"carl_valvo"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14729"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":18575,"title":"Oral Argument - February 21, 1989","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/18575"}],"citation":{"volume":"490","page":"107","year":"1989","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/17529"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

Johnson was tried and convicted under a Texas law outlawing flag desecration. He was sentenced to one year in jail and assessed a $2,000 fine. After the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction, the case went to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the desecration of an American flag, by burning or otherwise, a form of speech that is protected under the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that Johnson\u0027s burning of a flag was protected expression under the First Amendment. The Court found that Johnson\u0027s actions fell into the category of expressive conduct and had a distinctively political nature. The fact that an audience takes offense to certain ideas or expression, the Court found, does not justify prohibitions of speech. The Court also held that state officials did not have the authority to designate symbols to be used to communicate only limited sets of messages, noting that \"[i]f there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33811,"name":"Kathi Alyce Drew","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/kathi_alyce_drew","view_count":0,"last_name":"Drew","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"kathi_alyce_drew"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14737"},{"advocate":{"ID":45219,"name":"William M.

Conrail had always enforced Rule G of its agreement with its unionized employees, which forbids the use or possession of \"intoxicants, narcotics, amphetamines or hallucinogens\" by its employees. Previously, it routinely used drug screening urinalysis as part of return-to-duty medical examinations of employees with drug-related problems and in other examinations where the examining physician suspected drug use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Railway Labor Executives\u0027 Association (\"RLEA\")-- comprised of individuals in leadership positions at more than eighteen craft unions-- filed suit against Conrail, alleging that Conrail violated Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act (\"RLA\"). The RLA, passed in 1926 and amended in 1934, created the National Railroad Adjustment Board, an arbitration board designed to settle minor disputes between railroad companies and labor organizations. Under Sections 5 and 6 of the RLA, major disputes require an extensive mediation and conciliation process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistrict court Judge Anthony J. Scirica found that the dispute was \"minor\" under the Railway Labor Act because Conrail\u0027s decision was arguably justified by the terms of its agreement with the unions, and that the court had no jurisdiction over the dispute. Judge Dolores Sloviter of the U.S. Court of Appeals, 3rd Circuit reversed. Judge Sloviter rejected the district court\u0027s conclusion that Conrail\u0027s prior use of medical examinations arguably justified unilaterally changing its drug testing policy. The appeals court held that the dispute was \"major\" because it changed the terms and conditions governing employment relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the RLEA\u0027s opposition to Conrail\u0027s changed drug testing program create a \"major\" dispute under the Railway Labor Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Writing for the majority, Justice Harry Blackmun held that if Conrail asserts that its agreement with the unions gives Conrail the discretion to change their drug testing policy –assuming that claim is arguably justified by the terms of the agreement-- Conrail may make that change and the courts must defer to the decision of the RLA\u0027s arbitration board. Conrail\u0027s claim of a right to unilaterally change its drug policy –although based on implied terms of its contract with the RLEA—was not \"frivolous or obviously insubstantial.\" Conrail does not have to wait until the arbitration board makes a decision to change its drug testing policy.

Frazee was laid off from his job with the state of Illinois.  Kelly Services, a temp agency, offered him a job at a department store working Wednesday through Sunday.  Frazee “as a Christian” refused to work Sundays.  The store did not give Frazee the job.  Frazee did not claim that he was part of a particular religious sect or church or that working on Sundays violated a tenant of an established religious body.   When Frazee applied for unemployment benefits, the Illinois Department of Employment Security denied his claim because he turned down a job offer.  The Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit of Illinois affirmed.  The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that the free exercise clause does not require accommodations for “personal professed religious belief[s]”.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust a person who declines to work on Sunday because of a sincerely-held religious conviction prove that his conviction is a tenet of an established religious sect or body in order to claim the protection of the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a unanimous court, reversed the lower court and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that denying Frazee unemployment benefits violated the free exercise clause.  The state had no interest compelling enough to override an individual\u0027s exercise of sincerely-held religious beliefs, even though they were not part of an established religious sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40248,"name":"Robert J.

Riley owned a greenhouse that was located behind his home; from the ground, the contents of Riley’s greenhouse were shielded from view by its walls and the trees on his property. In 1984, the Pasco County Sheriff’s office received a tip that Riley was growing marijuana on his property. The investigating officer tried to see into the greenhouse from the ground but could not, so he circled in a helicopter at 400 feet and saw what he believed to be marijuana growing inside. Acting on this information, the investigating officer obtained a search warrant, searched the greenhouse, and found the marijuana. Riley was charged with possession of marijuana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search. The trial court granted his motion and held that viewing his property from the air violated Riley’s reasonable expectation of privacy. The District Court of Appeal of Florida, Second District, reversed the trial court’s decision and denied Riley’s motion to dismiss the evidence. The appellate court also certified the case to the Supreme Court of Florida, which reinstated the trial court’s order to suppress the evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the police officer violate the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy by observing his property from a helicopter with the naked eye?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that Riley had no reasonable expectation of privacy in this case because anyone could view Riley’s property from a helicopter flying in navigable airspace and figure out what was inside. The police officer did not enter Riley’s land or interfere with it in any way. Furthermore, the manner in which he was flying the helicopter was well within the law; therefore, the police officer was within his rights to view Riley’s property from the air. The Court determined that the police action in this case did not violate Riley’s Fourth Amendment rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor filed a concurring opinion in which she cautioned the majority against relying on the fact that the helicopter was flying within Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. She argued that the FAA regulations were meant to promote air safety and did not protect citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that, like the police activities in \u003cem\u003eKatz v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, the officer’s actions in this case violated Riley’s reasonable expectation of privacy. Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun argued that the burden of proving that a defendant lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy should rest with the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38382,"name":"Parker D.

This Commission was to attack the wide discrepancies in sentencing by federal court judges by creating sentencing guidelines for all federal offenses. It was to be part of the judicial branch, with members appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. John Mistretta (convicted of three counts of selling cocaine) claimed that the Act violated the delegation-of-powers principle by giving the Commission \"excessive legislative powers.\" This case was decided together with United States v. Mistretta.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Act violate the nondelegation doctrine of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found the Act to be valid because although Congress cannot generally delegate its legislative power to another Branch, the nondelegation doctrine does not prevent Congress from obtaining assistance from coordinate Branches. The test of validity is that an \"intelligible principle\" must be established by the legislature where the agency of the delegated authority must adhere to specific directives that govern its authority. The delegation to the Commission was sufficiently detailed and specific to meet these requirements.

However, Carole had an adulterous partner, Michael H., who obtained blood tests indicating that he was likely the biological father. When Michael obtained visitation rights in a California state court, Gerald argued that Michael had no ground under California law to challenge Gerald\u0027s paternity since more than two years had passed since Victoria\u0027s birth. According to Cal. Evid. Code 621, the child is \"presumed to be a child of the marriage\" and another man can only challenge this presumption within two years of birth. The court ruled in favor of Gerald and canceled Michael\u0027s visitation rights. Michael claimed that Code 621 violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by denying him an opportunity to establish his paternity. A California Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of Code 621.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Cal. Evid. Code 621 violate the Due Process Clause by denying a possible biological father the chance to establish his paternity of a child after two years have passed since the child\u0027s birth?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the judgment for a 5-4 court. Based on its analysis of common-law tradition, the plurality opinion found that a possible biological father does not have a fundamental right to obtain parental rights after the presumptive father has exercised significant responsibility over the child. Therefore due process protection does not apply. Code 621 was based on common-law precedent which showed \"an aversion to declaring children illegitimate\" and supported \"the interest in promoting the \u0027peace and tranquility of States and families.\u0027\" Restricting Michael\u0027s parental rights achieved this by granting Gerald the sole responsibility to play the role of Victoria\u0027s father.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38715,"name":"Robert A.W.

Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that a public figure plaintiff in a libel case must prove that the libelous statement was false or made without any regard for its truth. The fact that the newspaper failed to interview one of the main witnesses to the supposed bribery strongly indicated a disregard for the truth of the story. Although there were many reasons to doubt the truth of the accusations against Connaughton, the newspaper failed to properly investigate, so the act of publishing the story constituted actual malice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Byron R.

Blackmun wrote a concurring opinion where he argued that the Court might have looked at the facts of the case differently if the petitioner had not abandoned the defense that Harte-Hanks believed the report to be true.

Justice O\u0027Connor\u0027s opinion noted that the 30 percent quota could not be tied to \"any injury suffered by anyone,\" and was an impermissible employment of a suspect classification. O\u0027Connor further held that allowing claims of past discrimination to serve as the basis for racial quotas would actually subvert constitutional values: \"The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":46064,"name":"Walter H.

The abductor molested and sodomized the boy, then returned him to the carnival an hour and a half later. David’s mother took him to the Kino Hospital, where a doctor examined him and used a sexual assault kit to collect evidence. The police collected the kit and the boy’s clothes. The evidence from the kit was refrigerated, but the clothing was not. Nine days after the attack, David positively identified Larry Youngblood as the abductor from a photo lineup. The next day, a police criminologist examined the sexual assault kit and determined that sexual contact had occurred, but he did not test the clothing at that time. Youngblood was indicted on charges of sexual assault, kidnapping, and child molestation. The state moved to compel him to provide samples to compare with those from the sexual assault kit, but the trial court denied the motion because there was not enough sample material in the kit to make a valid comparison. In January 1985, the police criminologist tested the boy’s clothing for the first time and received inconclusive data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, police witnesses testified as to what the tests might have shown had they been conducted closer to the time the evidence was gathered. The court instructed the jury to consider the facts “against the state’s interests” if they found the state had lost or destroyed evidence by conducting the tests later. The jury found the defendant guilty. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed and held that, when identity is an issue at trial, the loss or destruction of evidence that could remove the defendant from suspicion is a denial of due process. The Supreme Court of Arizona denied the petition for review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the state’s failure to preserve potentially useful evidence constitute a denial of due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant must show bad faith on the part of the police to prove that the loss or destruction of evidence was a denial of due process. Requiring the police to retain every potentially useful piece of evidence places an undue burden on the police, while the bad faith restriction limits the police’s duty to what serves the interests of justice. The Court also held that, in this case, the police’s failure to refrigerate the clothing could at worst be negligent, but not in bad faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion concurring in judgment, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that, even without the Court’s ruling, the state has a strong interest in properly preserving as much evidence as possible. He also argued that there was no way to definitively say what the evidence might have shown and the jury still ruled in favor of the prosecution, which suggests that the evidence would not have been sufficient to exonerate Youngblood. Justice Stevens also argued that, while he concurred in the judgment, he found the majority’s opinion much broader than necessary to decide this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that, regardless of the state’s intent, police action that results in the defendant’s failure to receive a fair trial represents a denial of due process. He also argued that there is no bright-line distinction between good faith and bad faith police action, and therefore that guideline does not adequately protect the rights of criminal defendants. Without any way to know what the evidence would have shown, there is no proof that it would not have been enough to exonerate Youngblood, so the police’s failure to preserve the evidence effectively deprived Youngblood of his rights to due process. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20787,"name":"Daniel F.

When the lawyers won the case after years of litigation, they sought compensation from Missouri under the Civil Rights Attorney\u0027s Fees Awards Act of 1976. The district court calculated the amount owed using current market rates for attorney\u0027s fees. Missouri objected to paying the lawyers at current rates for work they performed in the past when rates were lower. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled against Missouri. Missouri alleged that the federal courts violated its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity privileges by forcing it to pay higher rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the Civil Rights Attorney\u0027s Fees Awards Act of 1976, does the Eleventh Amendment prohibit a federal court from requiring a state to pay lawyers at current market rates for past litigation? Can legal assistants be charged at current market rates rather than at their cost to the lawyers at the time of litigation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and Yes. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. delivered the opinion for a 7-1 court. The Court referred to its decision in \u003cem\u003eHutto v. Finney\u003c/em\u003e to establish that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply \"to an award of attorney\u0027s fees against a State.\" Therefore \"it follows that the same is true for the calculation of the amount of the fee.\" Charging current rates for lawyers compensated for the delay in payment to them. Further, charging current rates for legal assistants rather than their cost to attorneys during litigation took account of the entire service the lawyers provided. This constituted \"a reasonable attorney\u0027s fee\" under the Civil Rights Attorney\u0027s Fees Awards Act of 1976.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17636,"name":"Bruce Farmer","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/bruce_farmer","view_count":0,"last_name":"Farmer","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"bruce_farmer"},"advocate_description":"Assistant Attorney General of Missouri, argued the cause for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14796"},{"advocate":{"ID":33212,"name":"Jay Topkis","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jay_topkis","view_count":0,"last_name":"Topkis","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jay_topkis"},"advocate_description":"argued the cause for the respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/14797"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":19134,"title":"Oral Argument - February 21, 1989","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/19134"}],"citation":{"volume":"491","page":"274","year":"1989","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/17562"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

The reporter obtained all of his information, including the victim’s name, from the police report.  The police department did not restrict access to the pressroom or police reports, but there were several signs in the area instructing not to print victim’s names.  The newspaper also had a policy of not printing the full names of victims.  After the article ran,  Freedman and her family received several threatening phone calls, and Freedman sought mental counseling and police protection.  Freedman sued, claiming emotional distress.  The district court found Florida Star guilty of negligence under a Florida law that prohibits publishing the name of a victim of a sexual offense in any instrument of mass communication. The court awarded Freedman compensatory and punitive damages.  The district court of appeal affirmed and the Supreme Court of Florida denied review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a state impose criminal and civil sanctions on a newspaper for printing lawfully-obtained truthful information found in government records?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 6-3 decision, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that the civil damages imposed on Florida Star violated the First Amendment because the information was lawfully-obtained and truthful.  The Court hinted that there may be a situation where a victim’s privacy interest outweighed a newspaper’s First Amendment rights.  The Court also held that the Florida law prohibiting the printing of a victim’s name was under-inclusive because it did not limit the spread of a victim’s name through other means.  Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurrence, stating that the Florida statute was invalid because it did not protect a state interest of the highest order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, expressing that the majority’s decision departs from past precedent.  Justice White also rejected the majority’s assertion that the Florida law was under-inclusive.

Stanford was sentenced to death under a state statute which permitted juvenile offenders to receive the death penalty for Class A felonies or capital crimes. Stanford appealed his sentence and his case was consolidated with that of Wilkins v. Missouri, involving a 16 year old\u0027s appeal of his death sentence following a conviction for murder in Missouri. Both Stanford and Wilkins alleged that the imposition of the death penalty on offenders as young as themselves violated their constitutional rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the imposition of the death sentence on convicted capital offenders below the age of 18 years old, violate the Eighth Amendment\u0027s protection against cruel and unusual punishment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-4 decision the Court held that in weighing whether the imposition of capital punishments on offenders below the age of eighteen is cruel and unusual, it is necessary to look at the given society\u0027s evolving decency standards. With respect to American society, there is no national consensus regarding the imposition of capital punishments on 17- or 16-year-old individuals. Of the 37 states which permit capital punishment, 12 prohibit the death penalty for offenders below the age of 17 while 15 states prohibit capital punishment for 16 year olds. Moreover, discrepancies in national opinion polls, interest group views, and professional association studies, all indicate a lack of unanimity concerning the acceptability of death sentences for such relatively young offenders. Thus, the decision whether to subject 17 or 16 year olds to capital punishment must be made locally by the states and cannot be categorically pronounced as cruel and unusual punishment at this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23720,"name":"Frederic J.

The district court found that Virginia’s policy of either allowing death row inmates time in the prison law library or permitting them to have law books in their cells did not do enough to satisfy Virginia’s obligation to provide them some form of relief. That court also found the availability of attorneys to assist inmates was inadequate. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre States required under the Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to appoint counsel for indigent death row inmates seeking state post-conviction relief?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Due Process Clause requires states to appoint counsel for death row inmates looking for relief. States are not constitutionally obligated to provide relief post-conviction because the Constitution assures the right to counsel for an initial appeal from the judgment of the trial court. The Court also rejected the argument that capital cases require more legal assistance at collateral proceedings than non-capital cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote a concurring opinion in which she argued that a post-conviction proceeding is not part of the criminal process but is a civil action that does not require the state to provide proceedings. Prisoners were still able to obtain counsel, despite Virginia not adopting procedures that are were as far-reaching as those of other states. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent that claimed that Virginia’s procedure was unfair and did not provide indigent death row inmates an adequate opportunity to present their claims. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26356,"name":"Gerald T.

Charles M. Stanglin, the owner of the Twilight Skating Rink in Dallas, in compliance with this ordinance, split his skate rink into two sections: one section for patrons ages 14-18 and the other for anyone who pays the cost of admission. Stanglin sued the city to be able to un-divide the Twilight Skating Rink and argued that the ordinance placing age restrictions on dance halls violated the First Amendment right to freedom of association and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court held that the ordinance did not violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments and that the ordinance\u0027s purpose was to benefit the welfare of teenagers in Dallas by limiting their exposure to illicit activities. The Court of Appeals of Texas affirmed in part and reversed in part by holding that the ordinance did not violate the Equal Protections Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment but that the ordinance unconstitutionally infringed on the First Amendment right to freedom of association.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Do age restrictions on social gathering violate the First Amendment right to freedom of association?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Do age restrictions on social gathering violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, no. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the 9-0 majority. The Court held that the ordinance was intended to protect the youth of Dallas against corrupting activity, which they may have access to when intermingling with adults. Therefore, the age restrictions on youth activities were reasonable under the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of association and equal protection under the law considering they are enforced to protect the youth from corrupt activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he argued that the opportunity to socialize was protected under the Fourteenth Amendment, but that this case presented an issue of due process rather than freedom of association. He concurred with the judgment that the city ordinance protects teenagers and allowed them an even greater ability to associate than if the ordinance was not enforced. Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21496,"name":"Daniel J.

A group of nonwhite workers filed suit in federal district court alleging that Wards Cove practiced discriminatory hiring in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As evidence, the group compared the high percentage of nonwhites in unskilled work with the high percentage of whites in skilled work. The District Court rejected this claim because it found that Ward received unskilled workers through a hiring agency that enrolled primarily nonwhites. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that Ward had the burden of proof to show that its hiring practices were not discriminatory after the claimants presented evidence of racial disparity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eOnce employees present evidence of racial disparity among different classes of jobs, does the employer have to justify this disparity as a \"business necessity\" in order to avoid a \"disparate impact\" lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for a 5-4 court. The fact that one class of jobs at a firm has a higher percentage of nonwhites than another class does not by itself prove that the firm practices discriminatory hiring. Comparisons of race percentages among different job classes could wrongfully blame the employer, since what appears to show racial discrimination could in reality reflect the racial differences that exist in the labor market at large. Instead, the Court held that \"the proper comparison is generally between the racial composition of the at-issue jobs and the racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor market.\" If a substantial difference is found, then the claimants must show that it is the result of a hiring practice of the employer.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20856,"name":"Douglas M.

Michigan law exempts state retirement benefits from state taxes. Smith unsuccessfully petitioned for a refund on the state taxes he paid on his federal retirement benefits. He then filed suit in the Michigan Court of Claims arguing that the state\u0027s tax policy violated 4 U.S.C. 111 by taxing benefits paid to federal employees but not to state employees. The court dismissed his suit and so did the Michigan Court of Appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Michigan violate federal law when it exempted state and local government pensions from taxation but levied taxes on federal government pensions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy delivered the opinion for an 8-1 court. The Court emphasized the principles of intergovernmental tax immunity, which work to keep one part of the government from hindering the operations of another part. Section 111 allows a state to tax income paid by the federal government \"if the taxation does not discriminate against the officer or employee because of the source of the pay or compensation.\" Because the Court found no \"significant differences between the two classes [federal and state employees],\" it held that the Michigan tax distinguished between employees solely on \"the source of the pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37821,"name":"Paul S.

FBP regulations allow publications that may pose a threat to the security and discipline of prisons or that promote criminal activity to be rejected. Material cannot be rejected based on its political, philosophical, or distasteful nature, and prison officials have the burden of showing why the restriction was necessary and how the denied material was detrimental to penological interests. Abbott and others sued and argued that the restriction on certain publications violated their First Amendment rights. The district court held that prisons had a right to deny access to certain publications and that prison wardens must be given broad discretion in their duties to maintain the security of the prison, but their discretion must not limit the prisoners’ First Amendment right more than what is necessary to protect the government’s penological interests. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and held that the prison officials had the burden of showing how the denied material is detrimental to penological interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment prohibit the Federal Bureau of Prisons from denying prisoners access to certain publications?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that there is a substantial penological interest in denying access to certain publications because it is necessary to maintain the security and order of the prison. However, the limitation on the prisoners’ First Amendment rights must be no greater than what is necessary to the preserve the penological interest. Therefore, the Federal Bureau of Prisons may deny access to publications that include threats to security of the prison or may incite violence among prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that, while “penological interests” may be highly ambiguous, prison officials often require broad discretion to “prevent internal disorder.” Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44079,"name":"William C.
