In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that the commercial nature of the parody rendered it presumptively unfair.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay 2 Live Crew\u0027s commercial parody of Roy Orbison\u0027s \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" be a fair use within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that a parody\u0027s commercial character is only one element to be weighed in a fair use enquiry and that insufficient consideration was given to the nature of parody in weighing the degree of copying. The Court found that the Court of Appeals erred in applying the presumption that the commercial nature of the parody rendered it presumptively unfair, as no such evidentiary presumption was available to address either the character and purpose of the use or the market harm. Justice Souter wrote that the appellate court \"erred in holding that 2 Live Crew had necessarily copied excessively from the Orbison original, considering the parodic purpose of the use.\" Justice Anthony M. Kennedy filed a concurring opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17968,"name":"Bruce S.

Shortly before the new district commenced operations, the taxpayers and the association of state school boards embarked on a lawsuit claiming that the statute created a school district that limited access only to residents of Kiryas Joel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the 1989 statute violate the First Amendment\u0027s Establishment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that the statute\u0027s purpose was to exclude all but those who lived in and practiced the village enclave\u0027s extreme form of Judaism. This exclusionary intent failed to respect the Establishment Clause\u0027s requirement that states maintain a neutral position with respect to religion, because it clearly created a school zone which excluded those who were non-religious and/or did not practice Samtar Hasidism. Indeed, the very essence of the Establishment Clause is that government should not demonstrate a preference for one religion over another, or religion over non-religion in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31900,"name":"Julie S.

Unhappy with the IEP developed by the school district, Shannon\u0027s parents challenged its appropriateness and enrolled her in a private school while their challenge was pending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen state and local educational authorities concluded that the IEP was adequate, Shannon\u0027s parents sued in Federal District Court, claiming the school district had failed to provide a \"free appropriate public education\" as required by IDEA and demanding reimbursement for Shannon\u0027s education at the private school. The school district argued that the private school did not meet all the requirements of IDEA and therefore did not meet the \"appropriate\" standard. Because of it was not \"appropriate,\" the school district argued, reimbursement was not required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe District Court and the Fourth Circuit of Appeals both ruled against the school district, requiring it to reimburse Shannon\u0027s parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a court order reimbursement for parents who withdrew their child from a public school providing an inappropriate education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and put the child in a private school that is in substantial - but not complete - compliance with the act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.

The Court further held that the specific requirements of the Act need not be met when a student is placed in a private school by his or her parents, because the IDEA requirements were not intended to apply to parental placements.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38435,"name":"Peter W.

N.O.W. alleged that Scheidler and other anti-abortion protesters were members in a nationwide conspiracy to obstruct women\u0027s access to abortion clinics through a pattern of racketeering activity including the actual or implied threat of violence. The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the voluntary contributions are not proceeds of racketeering and that a \"racketeering enterprise\" must have an economic motive, a fact that NOW could not demonstrate. The Court of Appeals affirmed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes RICO require that an organization, to be defined as a racketeering enterprise, must be acting in pursuit of an economic motive?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe unanimous Court held that organizations without an economic motive can detrimentally \"affect interstate or foreign commerce,\" satisfying the RICO definition of a racketeering enterprise. An \"enterprise\" does not have to be an economic organization or a principally criminal organization to trigger the RICO act.

Upon hearing of the warrant, Albright surrendered to police detective Roger Oliver. A trial court dismissed the charge because it did not state an offense under Illinois law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbright claimed that Oliver violated his Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right by prosecuting him without probable cause. He filed suit against Oliver under 42 U.S.C. 1983, which provides relief to those deprived of civil rights. The federal District Court dismissed the suit because it did not state a claim under Section 1983. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that relief provided by Section 1983 for prosecution without probable cause is valid only if the prosecution caused a consequence such as loss of employment or incarceration.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a citizen prosecuted without probable cause obtain relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for the deprivation of substantive due process rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court ruled that Section 1983 relief for prosecution without probable cause is only valid if the prosecuted party claims Fourth Amendment (pretrial rights) violations.

The Department of Environmental Quality, determined the amount of the surcharge to be $2.25 per ton, significantly higher than the $0.85 per ton fee charged for in-state waste. Two waste disposal companies —Waste Systems Inc. and Columbia Resource Company (CRC) — disposed of waste generated out-of-state in Oregon. Waste Systems Inc. managed and owned a landfill in Oregon, and CRC transported waste from Washington State to Oregon. The companies challenged the surcharge in the Oregon Court of Appeals, arguing that it breached the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. However, the appellate court upheld the surcharge, and the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the surcharge that Oregon imposed on the in-state disposal of waste produced out-of-state a violation of the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a majority decision authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court noted that the Commerce Clause prohibits discrimination against interstate commerce, and a regulation is discriminatory if it \"taxes a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines.\" The majority determined that the surcharge was clearly discriminatory because waste disposal companies were required to pay three times more to dispose of waste produced out-of-state. Thus, for the surcharge to comply with the Commerce Clause, the Department of Environmental Quality needed to demonstrate that it had no choice but to use discriminatory means to serve some local purpose, but it failed to do so. Consequently, the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court was reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16723,"name":"Andrew J.

Gottshall\u0027s boss postponed seeking medical assistance during Johns\u0027 heart attack, insisted that the crew keep working, and left the body at the work site for the remainder of the work day. Shortly after Johns\u0027s death, Gottshall was admitted to a psychiatric institution. Gottshall sued Conrail under the Federal Employers\u0027 Liability Act (FELA) for exposing him to distressing circumstances which he claimed caused his illness. A District Court rejected the suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and found that Gottshall\u0027s injuries were \"genuine and severe.\" The Third Circuit contrasted the liberal injury recovery policy embodied in FELA over the more limited injury relief recovery policy embodied in common law standards, which often applied harsh tests to prove employee injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrail employee Alan Carlisle also filed a FELA action against Conrail. He claimed that Conrail subjected him to unsafe working conditions, which caused him stress and lead to health problems. Because the stress related health problems were foreseeable to Conrail, the Third Circuit affirmed the judgment for Carlisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the Federal Employers\u0027 Liability Act (FELA), does \"emotional stress\" resulting from employer \"negligence\" constitute an \"injury\" for which an employee can hold his employer liable?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Clarence Thomas authored the opinion for a 7-2 Court. The Court categorized FELA emotional stress claims closely with common law treatments of emotional stress claims. The Court rejected the Third Circuit\u0027s assertion that common law tests were arbitrary and could be disregarded. Instead, common law standards should be used to verify claims filed under FELA. The Court adopted the \"zone of danger test\" from common law, which limits relief to those employees who sustain physical injury resulting from emotional stress caused by employer negligence. The Court held that this test would best distinguish between genuine and fraudulent claims, and provide relief in the case of injury. The Court rejected the Third Circuit\u0027s holding that employers were liable for causing foreseeably stressful conditions, reasoning that this would extend to many types of everyday employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45597,"name":"William L.

The revenue from the plant would help compensate the contractor. Clarkstown promised that the plant would receive 120,000 tons of solid waste each year, and permitted the contractor to charge an $81 \"tipping fee\" for each ton received. To meet the 120,000 ton quota, Clarkstown adopted a \"flow control ordinance.\" The ordinance required that all solid waste flowing into and out of the town pass through the new plant. C \u0026amp; A Carbone, Inc. operated a similar plant within the town. To avoid paying the $81 fee, Carbone trucked processed waste directly to an Indiana landfill. In 1991, a Carbone truck carrying illegal waste crashed and police discovered that Carbone was violating the ordinance. Clarkstown sued Carbone in a New York Supreme Court. Carbone responded by suing Clarkstown in a federal District Court, claiming that the ordinance violated the Commerce Clause by disrupting interstate commerce. The District Court agreed but dissolved its injunction against Clarkstown when the New York Supreme Court ruled in favor of Clarkstown.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a town\u0027s \"flow control ordinance,\" which requires that all waste pass through a certain waste processing plant, violate the interstate Commerce Clause by disrupting commerce for waste processing plants in other states?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Tthe Court held 6-3 that the Commerce Clause invalidates local laws that discriminate against interstate commerce, disrupt the flow of articles of commerce, and grant municipalities disproportionate market gains. In an opinion authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court found that \"the article of commerce...is the service of processing and disposing of [waste].\" The Court held that the flow ordinance was discriminatory because \"[i]t hoards solid waste...for the benefit of the preferred processing facility.\" For the ordinance to be constitutional, the municipality would have had to prove that its effects on commerce are nondiscriminatory and justified by a \"legitimate local interest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17514,"name":"Betty Jo Christian","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/betty_jo_christian","view_count":0,"last_name":"Christian","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"betty_jo_christian"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/16090"},{"advocate":{"ID":43947,"name":"William C.

BFP secured the property by obtaining a deed of trust from Imperial Savings Association (Imperial). Imperial owned the property until BFP could pay off the amount borrowed. BFP defaulted on loan repayment and Imperial proceeded to sell the property for $433,000 to settle the loan (foreclosure). Before the title of ownership transferred to the buyer, BFP filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. BFP asked bankruptcy court to nullify the original foreclosure sale because the home was valued at over $725,000. BFP argued that the low sales price constituted a fraudulent transfer under 11 U.S.C. Section 548(a)(2)(A), which guarantees that debtors receive \"reasonably equivalent value\" for property foreclosed. BFP claimed \"reasonably equivalent value\" was equal to the market value of the property in question. The bankruptcy court denied BFP\u0027s claim, and a District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a property\u0027s fair market value determine whether the amount of debt settled by a foreclosure sale is \"reasonably equivalent\" to the property\u0027s worth, as required by U.S.C. Section 548(a)(2)(A)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, The Court ruled 5-4 that the value received for a property at a foreclosure sale can be reasonable even if it is different from the \"fair market value.\" A foreclosure sale alters market conditions and can lower a property\u0027s selling price. If a foreclosure sale is necessary to settle a debt, the price at which the property is sold is reasonable so long as \"all the requirements of the State\u0027s foreclosure law have been complied with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39975,"name":"Ronald J.

She filed suit in federal district court, claiming that the harassment created an \"abusive work environment\" in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The employer countered that the harassment had not been severe enough to seriously affect her psychologically or impair her ability to work, and that it therefore did not create an abusive work environment under the meaning of Title VII. The district court agreed, stating that the decision was a \"close case\" but that the harassment had not been severe enough to create an abusive work environment in violation of the Act. A Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals panel affirmed the district court\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust sexual harassment \"seriously affect [an employee\u0027s] psychological well being\" in order to create an \"abusive work environment\" that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an opinion written by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court found that the district court had been wrong to focus on whether or not the harassment had caused \"concrete psychological harm.\" Instead, Justice O\u0027Connor wrote that the court should have focused on whether the conduct was hostile or abusive. \"Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person\u0027s psychological well being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive... there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious (in order to find that it violates Title VII).\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41174,"name":"Stanley M.

When he was subsequently charged with the federal offense of possession of counterfeit currency, Alvarez defended himself by claiming that the delay between his arrest on state charges and his presentment on the federal charge rendered his confession inadmissible. Alvarez cited 18 U.S.C. Section 3501(c), which pronounced separate charge-based confessions inadmissible if obtained after the first six hours of detention. On appeal from a reversal of a district court\u0027s decision to uphold the confession, the Supreme Court granted the United States certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes federal statute 18 U.S.C. Section 3501(c), declaring separate charge-based confessions inadmissible if obtained after the first six hours of detention, apply to suspects that are held only on state or federal charges?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the provisions of the federal statute in question do not apply to suspects being held solely on state charges. The Court explained that no delay is said to occur until the suspect is arrested and detained for a federal crime. The six-hour period only begins to expire from the point of a suspect\u0027s federal arrest and charging. In this case, Alvarez-Sanchez was presented before a federal judge within six hours of his arrest on a federal counterfeit charge. The fact that he was held for some two and a half days prior has no bearing on his federal status under the statute since he was detained on state and local charges only during this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35754,"name":"Miguel A.

The Central Bank of Denver served as a trustee on the bonds. In 1988, there was concern that the land was no longer worth 160% of the value of the bonds’ outstanding principals and interests as required by the bond covenant. Before a review was completed, the Public Building Authority defaulted on the bonds. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst Interstate Bank of Denver and the other respondents had purchased $2.1 million of the bonds, and after the default, sued for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The respondents argued that Central Bank was also liable for aiding and abetting the violations. Central Bank petitioned the district court for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 impose a private liability for aiding and abetting manipulative or deceptive trading practices?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Anthony Kennedy delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the Securities Exchange Act only prohibits manipulative or deceitful actions, and it can only be used to prosecute such actions. Since the charge of aiding and abetting is not directly covered in the statute, companies cannot be liable for such actions. The Court also held that if Congress intended the statute to be used in such a way, it would have added a section that specifically addressed the issue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that the judicial history of similar cases showed that those who aid and abet in violations of the Securities Exchange Act are considered liable. He also argued that, given the liberal background to the construction of the Act, it is reasonable to assume that Congress intended it to have a broad applicability. Justices Harry A. Blackmun, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

Such discrimination was said to result from the fact that the use tax exceeded many in-state localities\u0027 sales tax rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Missouri\u0027s use tax violate the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in those localities where the use tax exceeds the local sales tax?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that the use tax was discriminatory in those localities where it exceeded the local sales tax. Such discrepancies, between certain localities\u0027 sales taxes and the state use tax, prevented the latter tax from being a valid \"compensatory\" tax, since it obviously did not impose a \"substantially similar\" burden on the interstate and intrastate commerce of such localities. The Court added that in those localities where the use tax did not exceed the local sales tax, no discriminatory treatment resulted and so the use tax\u0027s application would not be struck down in its entirety. Instead, the Court remanded the case back to Missouri for a decision on how to best correct certain of its localities\u0027 existing tax discrepancies.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20786,"name":"Don M.

Beecham argued that according to the statute\u0027s exemption clause (\"Any conviction...for which a person...has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction...\") he was no longer a convicted felon because Tennessee had restored his civil rights. Prosecutors pointed to the statute\u0027s \"choice of law clause,\" which states that \"What constitutes a conviction...shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.\" They argued that because Beecham\u0027s prior conviction was under federal law, no state could restore his right to possess a firearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe District Court ruled that a state could restore civil rights barred by a federal conviction, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decision. The Fourth Circuit\u0027s rule conflicted with those of the Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which held that the since the exemption clause applied to \"any conviction,\" it also permitted states to undo restrictions caused by federal convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder 18 U.S.C. 922(g), can state procedures for the restoration of the civil rights of felons restore the right of a federal felon to possess a firearm?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court. The Court applied the choice of law clause to the exemption clause and reasoned that no rights could be restored unless by the jurisdiction that first barred the rights. The Court ruled that though the federal government did not currently have any procedures in place to restore the civil rights of felons, only the federal government had jurisdiction over federal convictions. Therefore, Beecham\u0027s state-law restoration of civil rights was insufficient to restore his right to possess a firearm in light of 18 U.S.C. 922(g).\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22157,"name":"Edward C.

Farmer was convicted and sentenced to prison on federal criminal charges. Prison medical personnel diagnosed Farmer as a transsexual.  Farmer was generally kept separate from the general male population, in part because of Farmer’s misconduct, but also because of safety concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarmer was transferred to the U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute and placed in the general male population in accordance with prison policy.  Within two weeks, a cellmate allegedly beat and raped Farmer.  Farmer sued in federal district court, alleging that prison officials deliberately and indifferently failed to protect a prisoner.  This violated Farmer’s protection against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.  Farmer sought damages and an injunction against future incarceration in any prison.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prison officials, noting that Farmer never complained or expressed any safety concerns prior to the incident.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Farmer entitled to damages or an injunction against various federal prison officials responsible for transferring her to, or assigning Farmer within, a prison facility where Farmer was sexually assaulted by another inmate?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eMaybe.  Justice David H. Souter, writing for seven members of the court, vacated the lower court judgment and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that prison officials may be liable if they showed “deliberate indifference” to a substantial risk of serious harm when the official was subjectively aware of the risk and disregarded it.  The Court remanded the case for further consideration of whether prison officials were aware of the risk to Farmer.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun concurred, writing that inhumane prison conditions violate the Eighth Amendment regardless of a prison official’s state of mind.  Justice John Paul Stevens also concurred writing that he agreed with Justice Blackmun, but joined in the majority because it followed prior precedent.  Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the judgment arguing that conditions of confinement do not violate the Eighth Amendment unless they are imposed as part of a sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37685,"name":"Paul Bender","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/paul_bender","view_count":0,"last_name":"Bender","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"paul_bender"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/16157"},{"advocate":{"ID":21786,"name":"Elizabeth Alexander","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/elizabeth_alexander","view_count":0,"last_name":"Alexander","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"elizabeth_alexander"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/16158"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":19806,"title":"Oral Argument - January 12, 1994","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/19806"}],"citation":{"volume":"511","page":"825","year":"1994","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/18160"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15045,"name":"Harry A.

(Fantasy), John Fogerty sought to recover the cost of his attorney\u0027s fees from Fantasy. Fogerty based his claim on 17 U.S.C. section 505 which states in part that: \"the court may award a reasonable attorney\u0027s fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.\" On appeal from an unfavorable district court ruling, the Court of Appeals affirmed as it found that Fogerty did not demonstrate that Fantasy\u0027s original suit was frivolous or brought in bad faith. Fogerty appealed again, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo federal courts have discretion over whether or not to force a losing party to pay all or part of the victorious party\u0027s attorney\u0027s fees?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion, the Court held that while attorney\u0027s fees are awarded from time to time to prevailing defendants or plaintiffs, this practice is entirely subject to the deciding court\u0027s discretion. Indeed, the Court observed, that the statute in question emphasizes such discretion by stating in relevant part that a court \"may\" award attorney\u0027s fees.

Several months later, after Desktop claimed that Digital had misrepresented important facts during the settlement negotiations, the Court reopened the case and cancelled the agreement. Digital appealed, but the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to hear the case, holding that it was not immediately appealable under the guidelines laid out by the Supreme Court in \u003cem\u003eCoopers \u0026amp; Lybrand v. Livesay\u003c/em\u003e, 437 U.S. 463. The court held that the \"right not to go to trial\" claimed by Digital under the settlement was not sufficiently important to merit an immediate appeal and was different from immunity rooted in an explicit statutory or constitutional provision or compelling public policy rationale, the denial of which had been held immediately appealable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the denial of a \"right not to sue\" established by a settlement agreement immediately appealable under the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in \u003cem\u003eCoopers \u0026amp; Lybrand v.

It is important to have final judgments before appeals are made, Justice David H. Souter wrote for the Court, and exceptions should only be made in particularly important cases. A \"right not to go to trial,\" while significant, is rarely the key factor in a settlement agreement, and cannot compare in importance to the right to be free from \"double jeopardy\" in criminal court or the encroachment on public duties caused by a denial of immunity to public officials.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15086,"name":"John G.

She was also a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) licensed by the Florida Board of Accountancy (Board) and was authorized by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards—a private organization—to use the designation Certified Financial Planner (CFP). Ibanez used both of these titles in her advertising and on her law office\u0027s stationery. When the Board learned that Ibanez advertised these designations, she was charged with practicing public accounting at an unlicensed firm, which violated the Public Accountancy Act. The officer who heard the case recommended that the Board dismiss the charges due to a lack of proof. The Board refused and declared Ibanez guilty of \"false, deceptive, and misleading\" advertising. The District Court of Appeal of Florida, First Circuit, affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Board\u0027s decision to censure Ibanez use of her CPA and CFP designations violate the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that Ibanez\u0027s use of her CPA and CFP designations constituted commercial speech, which can only be restricted if it can be proven to be false or misleading and the state has a substantial interest in restricting it. Because Ibanez is fully licensed, her use of the designations was neither false nor misleading. Without evidence that the commercial speech caused \"real harms\" and that limiting it would restrict those harms, the Board did not meet its burden to show a substantial state interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which she argued that Ibanez\u0027s use of the CFP designation was misleading. Because it appears in conjunction with the CPA designation, Justice O\u0027Connor argued that the average consumer would be led to believe that a state licensing board controlled the use of both titles, which is not the case. Without listing the agency that regulates the use of the CFP title, the average consumer would be unable to verify this information. Because this designation is potentially misleading, the Board properly disciplined Ibanez with regard to the CFP designation. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the partial concurrence and partial dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41536,"name":"Silvia S.

Stansbury was not a suspect in the death, and did not receive Miranda warnings, but during questioning, made a statement that put him under suspicion.  After further questioning, Stansbury admitted to prior convictions for rape, kidnapping and child molestation.  At this point the interrogating officer advised Stansbury of his Miranda rights and Stansbury refused to make any further statements.  Stansbury requested an attorney and was arrested and charged with first-degree murder.  The trial court held that Stansbury was not truly in custody and therefore not entitled to Miranda warnings until suspicion focused on him.  The court refused to suppress Stansbury’s statements made prior to the warning.  Stansbury was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.  The Supreme Court of California affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a trial court determine that a criminal defendant is not \"in custody\" for Miranda purposes on the basis of police officers\u0027 subjective and undisclosed conclusions that they did not consider the defendant a \"suspect\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court and remanded.  The Court held that an officer’s subjective view is irrelevant to the determination of whether a person being interrogated is “in custody.”  On remand, the Supreme Court of California should consider whether the objective circumstances showed that Stansbury was in custody during his entire interrogation.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun concurred, writing that the death penalty cannot be imposed fairly within the constraints of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15476,"name":"Aileen Bunney","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/aileen_bunney","view_count":0,"last_name":"Bunney","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"aileen_bunney"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/16198"},{"advocate":{"ID":40829,"name":"Robert M.

(ABF) fired him for tardiness. Manson repeated his false excuse while under oath at a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, during which he argued that ABF had fired him in retaliation for his previous union activities. The National Labor Relations Board reversed the judge, ruling that ABF had used Manson\u0027s tardiness as a pretext to fire him. The Board reinstated him with backpay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eABF appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, claiming that the Board could not reinstate an employee who lied under oath. The Tenth Circuit ruled that the Board could determine whether or not to pardon Manson for giving a false excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the National Labor Relations Board grant reinstatement with backpay to an employee who lied under oath during his administrative hearing?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for a unanimous Court, reasoned that the National Labor Relations Act gave the Board broad authority to adopt laws regarding the reinstatement of employees. The Court called perjury \"intolerable in a formal proceeding,\" but ruled that the National Labor Relations Board was under no obligation to adopt a blanket rule against reinstating employees who have perjured themselves. Reducing the Board\u0027s discretion in making rules for employee reinstatement \"might force the Board to divert its attention from its primary mission and devote unnecessary time and energy to resolving collateral disputes about credibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31207,"name":"John V.

The district court sentenced him to five years of probation. When Granderson tested positive for cocaine, the court resentenced him under section 3565 of the U.S. Code. The section says that if a person serving a sentence of probation possesses illegal drugs, \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one third of the original sentence.\" The district court interpreted the phrase \"original sentence\" to refer to the term of probation imposed (60 months), rather than the 0-6 month imprisonment range set by the Guidelines. The court resentenced Granderson to 20 months\u0027 imprisonment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Granderson\u0027s new sentence. Citing \"lenity,\" the court agreed with Granderson that \"original sentence\" referred to the potential imprisonment range under the Guidelines, not to the actual probation sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnited States Code section 3565 says that if a person serving a sentence of probation possesses illegal drugs, \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one third of the original sentence.\" Does \"original sentence\" refer to the original imprisonment sentence range set by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, or to the term of probation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held 7-2 that the U.S. Code\u0027s section 3565 refers to the original sentence range set by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Therefore, the minimum revocation sentence for drug possession while on probation is one third the maximum of the Guidelines range of imprisonment; the maximum revocation sentence is the Guidelines maximum. The Court pointed out that the statute differentiates between \"sentence of probation\" and \"original sentence.\" Moreover, the history of the language shows that Congress may not have given it careful attention and that it \"may have been composed with an obsolete federal sentencing regime in the drafter\u0027s mind.\" In \"circumstances, where the text, structure, and statutory history fail to establish that the Government\u0027s position is unambiguously correct, the rule of lenity... resolve[s] the statutory ambiguity in Granderson\u0027s favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy concurred separately. Dissenting, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, with whom Justice Clarence Thomas concurred, argued that \"original sentence\" should be interpreted as the term of probation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42821,"name":"Thomas G.

The order required all dealers who sold milk to Massachusetts retailers to make a monthly premium payment to be distributed among in-state dairy farmers. Two Massachusetts milk dealers --West Lynn Creamery and LeComte\u0027s Dairy -- sell dairy products in Massachusetts. West Lynn Creamery relies on out-of-state producers; LeComte purchases all of its milk from West Lynn. The dealers filed an action in state court claiming that the order violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The state court rejected their claims; the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Massachusetts pricing order a breach of the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a majority decision authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court determined that the pricing order violated the Commerce Clause because it discriminated against interstate commerce. The majority found that while the pricing order taxed all dealers, the benefit of the tax was reserved exclusively for in-state dairy farmers and outweighed the tax they were required to pay. Thus, the Court concluded that, in effect, the pricing order functioned like a tariff, and was clearly unconstitutional. The decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41957,"name":"Steven J.

The week before his trial for capital murder was scheduled to begin, Simmons pled guilty to first-degree robbery and two counts of criminal sexual conduct in connection with two previous assaults. These guilty pleas rendered him ineligible for parole if convicted of any other violent-crime offense. Prior to jury selection, the trial court judge granted the prosecution’s motion to bar any questions pertaining to parole during the jury selection process. Simmons was convicted of murder and brought forth mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial. In closing arguments, the prosecution focused on the issue of the future danger the defendant presented to society as a reason to sentence him to death. The defense requested that the trial judge give a specific jury instruction clarifying the meaning of “life imprisonment” in this case, and the trial judge refused to do so. The jury sentenced Simmons to death. On appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court declined to reach a decision on the merits and instead held that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury satisfied the substance of Simmons’ request.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state court’s refusal to instruct a jury in a sentencing trial that a defendant is ineligible for parole violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion of the 7-2 plurality. The Supreme Court held that the lack of a specific instruction regarding the actual consequences of the jury’s decision led to Simmons being sentenced on the basis of essentially false information. The Due Process Clause grants defendants the right to “deny or explain” the evidence against them, and Simmons was not given the opportunity to do so regarding his potential future danger to society. Because evidence of future dangerousness often plays an important role in sentencing, preventing the jury from having access to the relevant information does not conform to the precedents established in Due Process jurisprudence. The Supreme Court also held that the South Carolina Supreme Court erred in holding that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury were sufficient. The instructions the trial judge gave did nothing to dispel any misunderstanding the jury members might have had regarding the meaning of the possible sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice David H. Souter wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that the trial judge has a responsibility to dispel jury misunderstandings of sentencing terms, particularly when the jury explicitly requests such guidance. Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the concurrence. In her separate concurrence, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the most basic right the Due Process Clause protects is the right to be heard, which was denied to Simmons when he was prevented from clarifying his parole situation. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote an opinion concurring in judgment in which she argued that the Due Process Clause guarantees a defendant’s right to rebut the prosecution’s evidence against him. In a sentencing trial in which the prosecution bases its argument on the defendant’s future dangerousness, the Constitution requires that the defendant have the opportunity to provide evidence to the contrary. Proof that the defendant will not be released is sometimes the only way to rebut the prosecution’s evidence. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Anthony Kennedy joined in the opinion concurring in judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the majority’s opinion creates an overbroad reading of the Due Process Clause’s power to override state law regarding the admissibility of parole information. Such an issue should be left to the states to decide individually, as there is no indication in the Constitution that the Due Process Clause requires such a strict national standard. Justice Clarence Thomas joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20632,"name":"David I.

Davis.  Shackelton refused to pay, and was later found behind the pool club beaten to death with a pool cue.  The Naval Investigative Service (NIS) questioned Davis after finding a bloodstain of one of the pool cues Davis owned.  Before questioning, Davis waived his rights to remain silent and to counsel both orally and in writing.  About an hour and a half into questioning, Davis said, “Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.”  The interviewing agents attempted to clarify the statement and reminded Davis he could remain silent and/or speak to counsel, but Davis said, “No, I don’t want a lawyer.”  Questioning continued for another hour before Davis said, “I think I want a lawyer before I say anything else.”  At this point questioning ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Davis was convicted on one count of unpremeditated murder and sentenced to confinement for life and dishonorable discharge.  Davis appealed, arguing that the NIS investigators violated his right to counsel, as laid out in \u003ci\u003eEdwards v. Arizona\u003c/i\u003e, when they continued questioning after Davis indicated he “maybe” should talk to a lawyer.  The U.S. Court of Military Appeals affirmed the conviction, finding that Davis’ statements were ambiguous and the NIS appropriately clarified Davis’ wishes before continuing questioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a suspect makes an ambiguous request for counsel during a custodial interrogation, must the interrogator cease questioning until the suspect is provided with counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, writing for five members of the court, affirmed.  The Supreme Court held that, assuming \u003ci\u003eEdwards\u003c/i\u003e applies in military proceedings, investigators do not need to cease questioning when an accused makes an ambiguous statement like “Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.”  The Court noted that, while it was proper for the investigators to clarify Davis’ intentions, the Court does not require investigators to adopt that practice in future interrogations.  Justice Antonin Scalia concurred, writing that the Court should consider the federal statute governing the admissibility of confessions in federal prosecutions the next time a similar case comes before the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice David H. Souter concurred in the judgment, but expressed that investigators have a legal obligation to clarify ambiguous statements that could reasonably be understood as a request to consult with a lawyer.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined in the concurrence in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40548,"name":"Richard H.

Sections 4 and 5 of this Act required cable systems to allocate a percentage of their channels to local public broadcast stations, the must-carry rules. The rules limit the cannels available for exclusive control by cable programmers and increase competition for the remaining channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre the must-carry rules content-based and thus a violation of the cable companies\u0027 First Amendment right to free speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court held that the must-carry provisions were content neutral, thus not a violation of the First Amendment. The rules were not determined by the programming content, but by broadcast method. The rules promote fair competition in television programming. Congress recognized that the public television stations had an intrinsic value to the American public and were in economic peril of disappearing due to the cable television industry\u0027s monopoly. The rules do not force the cable companies to alter their message.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27019,"name":"H.

He filed an action in federal district court claiming that the prosecution engaged in an “unlawful, unreasonable, and arbitrary investigation” before his arrest and knowingly destroyed favorable evidence.  Heck sought compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983, but did not seek a release from custody.  The district court dismissed the action.  While his appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was pending, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence.  Heck’s petition for habeas corpus was denied.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Heck’s damages action, stating that the action challenged the legality of the conviction, so Heck must exhaust all state remedies before seeking §1983 relief like he would under the habeas corpus statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Can a state prisoner attacking the legality of his conviction circumvent the habeas corpus exhaustion requirement by filing an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and confining his prayer for relief to a declaratory judgment and money damages?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Should a state prisoner\u0027s action attacking the legality of his conviction that includes unexhausted claims be dismissed without prejudice?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Yes.  Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for five members of the court, affirmed.  The Supreme Court held that a defendant cannot claim damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment without showing that the conviction or sentence has been overturned in some way.  The defendant must also exhaust state court remedies before bringing a §1983 action.  The Court derived its analysis from the common law tort of malicious prosecution which requires termination of the criminal proceeding before it can begin.  Justice Clarence Thomas concurred, writing that the majority’s opinion limited the scope of §1983.  Justice David H. Souter concurred in the judgment, arguing that the proper way to resolve the case would be to interpret § 1983 in light of the habeas corpus statute instead of common law torts.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the concurrence in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19917,"name":"Charles A.

In 1992, in response to anti-abortion protesters, a state court prohibited the protesters from physically abusing those entering or exiting the clinic, or otherwise interfering with access to the clinic. About 6 months later, Women\u0027s Health Center Inc. expressed a need to broaden the court order. The state court agreed, banning demonstrators from entering a 36-foot buffer-zone around the clinic, making excessive noise, using images visible to patients, approaching patients within a 300-foot radius of the clinic, and protesting within a 300-foot radius of staff residences. Petitioner Judy Madsen and her fellow protesters claimed that these restrictions violated their First Amendment right to free speech, but the Florida Supreme Court disagreed, upholding the court order.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1) Is the prohibition of all protesting within the 36-foot buffer zone around the front of the clinic an infringement of the First Amendment right to free speech? 2) Is the 36-foot buffer zone along the back and side of the clinic a breach of the First Amendment right to free speech? 3) Do the limitations imposed on noise-making constitute a breach of the First Amendment right to free speech? 4) Do the restrictions placed on the use of images violate the First Amendment right to free speech? 5) Is it a breach of the First Amendment right to free speech to bar protesters from approaching potential patients when they are within a 300-foot radius of the clinic? 6) Is it a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech to prohibit all protesting in a 300-foot radius of clinic staff residences?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Yes, No, Yes, Yes, and Yes. In a majority opinion authored by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court found that the state of Florida could only restrict protesters to the extent necessary to allow the clinic to run and the staff to live in their homes without interference. Thus, the majority approved of the 36-foot buffer zone around the front of the clinic because it was essential to allow patients and staff to enter and leave the building freely, but disapproved of the 36-foot buffer zone along the back and side of the building because it found no indication that protesting in these areas interfered with the function of the clinic. The Court also determined that the limitations placed on noise-making were necessary to insure the well-being of the patients, whereas those placed on images were not because they were easier to ignore. Finally, the Court concluded that both 300-foot radius rules were too broad, thus restricting the protestors more than was necessary. Therefore, the decision of the Florida Supreme Court was affirmed in part and reversed in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36736,"name":"Mathew D.

Under this method, the multinational\u0027s income was taxed in proportion to the average percentage of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located inside the state. Barclays Bank of California (Barcal) was wholly owned by a multinational corporation, Barclays Bank International Limited (BBI). Barcal did not include financial data for BBI in its 1977 tax filings. The California Franchise Tax Board (Tax Board) determined that Barcal misrepresented the proportion of income subject to taxation, causing a tax deficiency of over one hundred thousand dollars. Barcal and BBI paid, but then sued for the amount paid, complaining that the cost to provide BBI\u0027s worldwide financial data was disproportionately large considering that Barcal operated largely independently of BBI and BBI operated largely outside of California. Barcal and BBI contended that this violated the Commerce Clause-derived anti-discrimination requirement, which prevents States from imposing disproportionately large tax compliance burdens upon corporations. The Tax Board allowed BBI to make a \"reasonable approximation\" of financial data to minimize costs, but BBI claimed that this action violated Due Process by admitting financial data that was possibly inaccurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe California Supreme Court found no constitutional violation and remanded the case to a California Court of Appeals, which also did not find the burden disproportionate. Barcal and BBI also contended that the \"worldwide combined reporting\" method risked double taxation by the state and the federal government. Additionally, The \"worldwide combined reporting\" method deviated from taxing methods employed by other states, thus transgressing the federal government\u0027s interest in providing uniform standards for taxing foreign commerce. (The case was consolidated with \u003cem\u003eColgate Palmolive Co. v. Franchise Tax Board Of California\u003c/em\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1) Does a state violate the Due Process Clause by accepting \"reasonable approximations\" of financial data?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2) By requiring multinational corporations to provide exhaustive financial information to calculate taxes, does a State impose a disproportionately large compliance burden upon the corporation and thereby violate the anti-discrimination requirement of the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Ruth Ginsburg wrote the opinion for a 7-2 Court. (1) The Court dismissed the alleged Due Process violation because a corporation could take action against the Tax Board if it felt the approximated amount was inaccurate. (2) Reasoning that the use of \"reasonable approximations\" minimized a multinational\u0027s compliance burden, the Court also dismissed the alleged Commerce Clause violation. The Court recognized that the \"worldwide combined reporting\" method carried a risk of double taxation by both the state and the federal government, but reasoned that this did not violate the Commerce Clause because every other method employed by the state to tax foreign commerce carried the same risk. Also, the Court found no \"specific indications of congressional intent\" to enforce uniformity in taxation of foreign commerce by preempting the California tax laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31245,"name":"James P.

She sued the city and the District Court ordered a preliminary injunction. Ladue repealed the law and replaced it with a new one which also banned window signs.

Miller returned home to Mississippi, and filed a suit against the company in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana. The suit was filed under the Jones Act, a federal law that allows a seaman to sue his employer in either federal or state court when he suffers personal injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerican Dredging moved to dismiss the case under the doctrine of \"forum non conveniens,\" which allows a court to dismiss a case if it is filed in a place that is unnecessarily and significantly inconvenient to the defendant. The trial court agreed, holding that a Louisiana law making the doctrine of \"forum non conveniens\" inapplicable in Jones Act cases was superseded by federal maritime law (law that deals with oceanic commerce). An appeals court affirmed the decision, but the Louisiana Supreme Court overturned it, holding that the Louisiana law was not superseded by federal maritime law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Constitutional grant of federal jurisdiction over maritime law (found in Article III Section 2) prevent states from prohibiting (in maritime cases) \"forum non conveniens\" claims that, under federal law, would be permitted?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court decided that \"forum non conveniens\" claims were only procedural, not substantive, and that national uniformity was therefore not required by the Constitution. Writing for the seven-member majority, Justice Antonin Scalia stated \"venue is a matter that goes to process rather than substantive rights -- determining which among various competent courts will decide the case. Uniformity of process (beyond the rudimentary elements of procedural fairness) is assuredly not what the law of admiralty seeks to achieve, since it is supposed to apply in all the courts of the world.\" Further, Scalia wrote that the amount of discretion left to the trial court by the forum non conveniens doctrine necessarily meant that, even if it was embraced by every state, it would still not result in uniformity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31702,"name":"John F.

Over the course of the next few months, finding that the union had disregarded the warning more than 400 times, the court fined them more than $64 million in what it termed civil fines, payable to the state of Virginia. After the strike was settled the court refused to cancel the fines, despite the fact that the strike settlement had called for their cancellation. The Court ruled that the fines were payable to the state, not the mining company, and that the settlement could not therefore cancel them. The Virginia Court of Appeals reversed, canceling the fines in accordance with the settlement agreement, but on further appeal the Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the fines. It held that the union had been warned in advance and could have avoided the fines, meaning that it controlled its own destiny. The fines were therefore not criminal (imposing criminal fines would have required a jury trial) but instead civil, as the trial court had argued, because they were intended to maintain order and respect for the courts by encouraging compliance with a court order.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWere the fines assessed against the United Mine Workers of America union, amounting to more than $64 million, criminal or civil in nature?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe fines were criminal in nature. The Supreme Court unanimously held that they had been intended to punish the union, not merely to maintain order or respect for the judiciary, and that the union was therefore entitled to the heightened protections of a criminal proceeding, such as a jury trial. Justice Harry Blackmun in the opinion of the Court, wrote, \"The union\u0027s sanctionable conduct did not not occur in the court\u0027s presence or otherwise implicate the court\u0027s ability to maintain order and adjudicate the proceedings before it. ... Instead, the Virginia trial court levied contempt fines for widespread, ongoing, out-of-court violations of a complex injunction. In so doing, the court effectively policed petitioner\u0027s compliance with an entire code of conduct that the court itself had imposed. ... Under such circumstances, disinterested factfinding and evenhanded adjudication were essential, and petitioners were entitled to a criminal jury trial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23675,"title":"Oral Argument - November 29, 1993","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23675"}],"citation":{"volume":"512","page":"821","year":"1994","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27084"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15239,"name":"Rehnquist Court (1993-1994)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/rehnquist9","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15141,"name":"William H.
