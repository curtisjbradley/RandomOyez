The CFPB was tasked with writing and enforcing rules for financial institutions, examining financial institutions, monitoring and reporting on markets, and tracking consumer complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, the CFPB adopted a rule that prohibited lenders from further attempting to withdraw funds from borrowers’ bank accounts after two consecutive attempts failed for lack of funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of lenders sued the CFPB over that rule, arguing that the agency’s funding scheme was unconstitutional. Instead of receiving money allocated to it each year by Congress, as most agencies do, the CFPB receives funding directly from the Federal Reserve, which collects fees from member banks.

Relying on 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), Pulsifer asked the district court for a sentence lower than the otherwise applicable statutory minimum term of imprisonment. That provision, permits a district court to impose a sentence lower than the statutory minimum upon finding that the defendant does not have: “(A) more than 4 criminal history points, excluding any criminal history points resulting from a 1-point offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines; (B) a prior 3-point offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines; and (C) a prior 2-point violent offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was undisputed that Pulsifer had a criminal history that meets the criteria in subsections (A) and (B), due to having more than four criminal history points and a prior three-point offense. The district court concluded that this history alone made him ineligible for sentencing under § 3553(f), notwithstanding that he did not also have a prior two-point violent offense that would meet the condition in subsection (C). It therefore denied his request under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulsifer appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding the statutory word “and” means a defendant must not have \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e of the criteria, not that he must not have \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust a defendant show he does not meet any of the criteria listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) to qualify for a sentence lower than the statutory minimum?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA defendant must satisfy individually each of the three conditions of the “safety valve” provision of 18 U.S.C. §3553(f)(1) to be eligible for sentencing relief. Justice Elena Kagan authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court acknowledged that each party offered a grammatically permissible reading of Paragraph (f)(1). However, the text and context of that paragraph, as read against the Guidelines more generally, support the Government’s reading. Pulsifer’s reading—that a defendant is eligible as long as he does not have all three characteristics in combination—would render part (A) superfluous, since a defendant with a 3-point offense under (B) and a 2-point violent offense under (C) would always have more than 4 criminal history points under (A). Additionally, Pulsifer\u0027s reading would allow relief for some defendants with more serious criminal histories while denying it to those with less serious records, contrary to the provision’s purpose of sorting defendants based on the seriousness of their prior offenses. Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply because there is no genuine ambiguity in the statutory language because, while there are two grammatically permissible readings, the context supports only one of those readings. Thus, Pulsifer was ineligible for safety valve relief because he had two prior 3-point offenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined, arguing that the majority for engaged in “implicit distribution,” reading words into and out of the statute to manufacture a superfluity problem that does not actually exist. Justice Gorsuch further argued that the majority elevated unexpressed congressional purposes over the statutory text and dismissed variations in Congress’s use of ‘and” and “or” as sloppy mistakes, even though Congress expressly distributed phrases elsewhere in the statute when it wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41249,"name":"Shay Dvoretzky","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/shay_dvoretzky","view_count":0,"last_name":"Dvoretzky","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"shay_dvoretzky"},"advocate_description":"for the Petitioner ","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23447"},{"advocate":{"ID":62593,"name":"Frederick Liu","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/frederick_liu","view_count":0,"last_name":"Liu","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"frederick_liu"},"advocate_description":"for the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23448"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":25478,"title":"Oral Argument - October 02, 2023","unavailable":false,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/25478"}],"citation":{"volume":"601","year":"2024","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27943"},"decisions":[{"description":"A defendant must satisfy individually each of the three conditions of the “safety valve” provision of 18 U.S.C. §3553(f)(1) to be eligible for sentencing relief.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15094,"name":"Elena Kagan","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/elena_kagan","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kagan","roles":[{"id":2738,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":1281157200,"date_end":0,"appointing_president":"Barack Obama","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2738"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32690,"mime":"image/png","size":44456,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/elena_kagan/elena_kagan.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":4259,"identifier":"elena_kagan"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"majority","seniority":5,"ideology":0,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/212779"},{"member":{"ID":15086,"name":"John G.

In June 2019, the yacht ran aground, incurring at least $300,000 in damage. Raiders submitted a claim to GLI for loss of the vessel, but GLI rejected it, claiming that, although none of the damage was due to fire, the entire policy was void because Raider had failed to timely recertify or inspect the yacht\u0027s fire-extinguishing equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGLI asked the district court for a declaratory judgment that Raiders’ omission voided the policy, and Raiders raised five counterclaims based on Pennsylvania law. The district court dismissed those counterclaims, finding that ​​the policy’s choice-of-law provision required the application of New York law. The court also rejected Raiders’ argument that the choice-of-law provision was unenforceable under the Supreme Court’s decision in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/71-322\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Bremen v.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Constitution confers federal jurisdiction over all maritime cases to ensure uniformity across the United States, with federal courts deriving maritime law from various sources such as judicial opinions and scholarly writings. In the absence of established maritime rules, federal courts possess the authority to formulate new, uniform maritime rules. Relevant to this discussion, federal maritime law presumes the validity of choice-of-law provisions in maritime contracts. The precedent set by the Wilburn Boat case, which permitted state law to address the absence of uniform federal maritime rules, does not extend to choice-of-law provisions. Therefore, contrary to Raiders’ argument, state law does not serve to fill any gaps in this context, reinforcing the federal rule\u0027s presumption of enforceability for choice-of-law clauses in maritime contracts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas authored a concurring opinion to argue that the Wilburn Boat precedent rests on flawed premises and is at odds with the fundamental precept of admiralty law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33557,"name":"Jeffrey B.

Eventually, he grew too popular for Facebook\u0027s 5,000-friend limit on profiles. So Freed converted his profile to a \"page,\" which has unlimited \"followers\" instead of friends and is public so that anyone may \"follow\" it. Freed designated the page category as \"public figure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, Freed was appointed city manager for Port Huron, Michigan, so he updated his Facebook page to reflect that new title. On his page, he shared both personal updates about himself and his family and professional updates, including directives and policies he initiated in his official capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKevin Lindke came across Freed’s page and did not approve of how Freed was handling the pandemic. He posted criticism of Freed in response to Freed’s Facebook page, and Freed deleted the comments and ultimately “blocked” Lindke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindke sued Freed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violating his First Amendment rights by deleting his comments and blocking him. The district court granted summary judgment to Freed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen does a public official’s social media activity constitute state action subject to the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA public official who prevents someone from commenting on the official’s social-media page engages in state action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 only if the official both (1) possessed actual authority to speak on the State’s behalf on a particular matter, and (2) purported to exercise that authority when speaking in the relevant social-media posts. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSection 1983 provides a cause of action against a person “who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State” deprives someone of a federal constitutional or statutory right. Thus, to establish a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must show actions attributable to a state, not those of a private person. Sometimes, state action is clear, but other times, the line between private conduct and state action is more difficult to draw. State officials retain their own First Amendment rights to speak about their jobs as private citizens. To determine whether an official was acting in an official capacity or as a private citizen on social media, courts must look at factors like whether the account was designated as personal or official, whether individual posts expressly invoked the official\u0027s state authority, and the immediate legal effect of the posts. Additional contextual factors like the official\u0027s use of government staff to make posts may also be relevant in unclear cases. Because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit applied a different test, the Court vacated its judgment and remanded the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":56065,"name":"Allon Kedem","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/allon_kedem","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kedem","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"allon_kedem"},"advocate_description":"for the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23468"},{"advocate":{"ID":63621,"name":"Victoria R.

The Trustees began to hide or delete the critical and often repetitive comments by the Garniers, and then around October 2017, they blocked the Garniers from their social media pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Trustees blocked the Garniers, the Garniers sued them, arguing that their social media pages constitute public fora and that by blocking them, the Trustees violated their First Amendment rights. The district court granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the Garniers but found that the Trustees’ had qualified immunity from the damages claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a public official engage in state action subject to the First Amendment by blocking an individual from the official’s personal social media account, which the official uses to communicate about job-related matters with the public?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit’s judgment—that 42 U.S.C. § 1983’s state-action requirement was satisfied because of the “close nexus” between petitioners’ social media pages and their positions as public officials—is vacated, and the case is remanded in light of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-611\"\u003eLindke v.

Brown pleaded guilty to one charge of drug possession and distribution as well as the § 922(g) offense. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania sentenced him to concurrent terms of 180 months’ imprisonment due to prior convictions triggering the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). Brown appealed his enhanced sentence, arguing that his prior state marijuana convictions should not serve as predicates under the ACCA because those crimes are no longer a categorical match to their federal counterpart.

Under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, Murray was required to certify that his reports were produced independently and that they accurately reflected his own views. According to Murray, two leaders at UBS improperly pressured him to skew his research. Murray repeatedly reported this conduct to his supervisor, who declined to take action. UBS terminated Murray in 2012.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurray sued UBS in 2014 alleging that his former employer terminated him in response to his complaints about fraud on shareholders in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u0027s antiretaliation provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A. The district court ruled for Murray, and UBS appealed, arguing that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that Murray had to prove UBS\u0027s retaliatory intent to prevail on his section 1514A claim. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with UBS and vacated the judgment of the district court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, must a whistleblower prove his employer acted with “retaliatory intent” as part of his case in chief?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA whistleblower who invokes §1514A must prove that his protected activity was a contributing factor in the employer’s unfavorable personnel action, but need not prove that his employer acted with “retaliatory intent.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 includes a provision that protects whistleblowers, explicitly prohibiting employers from engaging in retaliation, such as firing, demoting, suspending, threatening, harassing, or discriminating in any way against an employee\u0027s employment conditions “because of” the employee\u0027s engagement in protected whistleblowing activities. A whistleblower must first demonstrate that their whistleblowing was a significant factor in the alleged adverse employment action, and then the burden shifts to the employer, who must prove that they would have made the same adverse employment decision regardless of the whistleblower\u0027s actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the word “discriminate” in the statute does not inherently require “retaliatory intent,” which refers to animus or prejudice. Further, to require a whistleblower to prove “retaliatory intent,” as UBS argues, would ignore the statute’s mandatory burden-shifting framework. Contrary to UBS’s contention, innocent employers will not face liability for legitimate, nonretaliatory personnel decisions. The burden-shifting framework precludes that outcome. Thus, A whistleblower who invokes 18 U.S.C. § 1514A must prove only that his protected activity “was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Samuel Alito authored a concurring opinion, in which Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined, reiterating the Court’s rejection of the “animus” requirement does not eliminate the intent requirement of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63611,"name":"Easha Anand","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/easha_anand","view_count":0,"last_name":"Anand","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"easha_anand"},"advocate_description":"for the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23454"},{"advocate":{"ID":17293,"name":"Anthony A.

The Act was amended in 1996 to impose additional obligations on entities like creditors and lenders that furnish information to credit reporting agencies. These amendments allowed consumers to dispute inaccuracies in their credit files and mandated furnishers to investigate and correct such inaccuracies. Reginald Kirtz filed a lawsuit in 2020 against Trans Union, AES, and the USDA, alleging both negligent and willful violations of the FCRA. Kirtz claimed that despite his loans being closed with a zero balance, both AES and the USDA continued to report him as “120 Days Past Due,” damaging his credit score. While Trans Union and AES responded to the lawsuit, the USDA sought dismissal, citing sovereign immunity. The district court granted the USDA’s motion, reasoning that the FCRA did not clearly express Congress’s intent to waive sovereign immunity, despite the Act’s language stating that it applies to “any person,” including government agencies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, concluding that when Congress has clearly expressed its intent, as through the FCRA, even when the meaning is implausible, courts may neither second-guess its choices nor decline to apply the law as written.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the civil-liability provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act unequivocally and unambiguously waive the sovereign immunity of the United States?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe civil-liability provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) waive the sovereign immunity of the United States. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a sovereign entity, the United States is generally immune from suits seeking money damages—under the doctrine known as “sovereign immunity”—unless Congress chooses to waive that immunity. Courts understand Congress to have so chosen only if they find “the language of the statute” is “unmistakably clear” in allowing such suits. One way a statute may have such “unmistakably clear” language is when it creates a cause of action and explicitly “authorizes suit against a government on that claim.” The FCRA satisfies this stringent test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe FCRA’s requirements apply to “person[s]” who, like the federal government here, furnish information to consumer reporting agencies. Sections 1681n and 1681o create a cause of action for money damages to consumers injured by “any person” who willfully or negligently fails to comply with the statute’s directive. Section 1681a provides a definition of “person” that includes government agencies, which applies to the entire Act. In the presence of such “unmistakably clear” language, no separate waiver provision is needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63301,"name":"Benjamin W.

KisanKraft is a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC), meaning it is majority-owned by U.S. persons but operates abroad. Prior to 2017, U.S. shareholders of CFCs were typically taxed on foreign earnings only when those earnings were repatriated to the United States, according to a provision called Subpart F. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 significantly changed this, introducing a one-time Mandatory Repatriation Tax (MRT) that retroactively taxed CFC earnings after 1986, regardless of repatriation. This increased the Moores’ 2017 tax liability by approximately $15,000 based on their share of KisanKraft’s retained earnings. The Moores challenged the constitutionality of this tax, but the district court dismissed their suit, holding that the MRT taxed income and, although it was retroactive, did not violate the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.

Both programs offer a maximum of 36 months of education benefits. Congress has implemented various provisions to limit the benefits under these two programs, including a 48-month cap for benefits generally and the prohibition against receiving benefits from both programs concurrently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Rudisill, who served three periods of active-duty service, initially used the Montgomery benefits for his undergraduate education.

Police searched his home and found a rifle and a pistol, leading to Rahimi’s indictment for violating federal law 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8), which makes it unlawful for someone under a domestic violence restraining order to possess firearms. Rahimi moved to dismiss the indictment on constitutional grounds but was denied, as his argument was foreclosed by United States v.

In 2019, after being arrested for selling crack cocaine, he faced deportation proceedings. Wilkinson conceded his deportability but sought either cancellation or withholding of removal based on the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” it would cause his son and the threat to his own life or freedom if he returned to Trinidad due to his “membership in a particular social group,” specifically people who have filed complaints against Trinidadian police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals rejected both of Wilkinson\u0027s claims. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the hardship claim because was discretionary. The Third Circuit also concluded that Wilkinson’s claim of belonging to a “particular social group” did not meet the requirements for withholding of removal, as it was not socially distinct within Trinidadian society. Therefore, the Third Circuit dismissed in part and denied in part Wilkinson’s petition for review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs an agency determination that a given set of established facts does not rise to the statutory standard of “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” a mixed question of law and fact reviewable under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), or instead a discretionary judgment call unreviewable under Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eAn immigration judge’s discretionary decision that a given set of established facts does not satisfy 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(D)’s “exceptional and extremely unusual” hardship standard for determining eligibility for cancellation of removal is a mixed question of law and fact, reviewable under §1252(a)(2)(D)’s jurisdiction restoring exception for “questions of law.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored the majority opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe application of the statutory hardship standard to an established set of facts presents a quintessential mixed question of law and fact. While this determination requires close examination of the facts, under the Court’s precedent in Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, a mixed question that requires factual analysis is still a mixed question and therefore a “question of law” that courts have jurisdiction to review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court rejected the government’s arguments that Guerrero-Lasprilla should be limited to judicially created standards, that the statutory history precludes review, and that a primarily factual mixed question is a question of fact. Nothing in § 1252(a)(2)(D) suggests “questions of law” is limited to only certain types of mixed questions. While courts still cannot review the underlying factual determinations, the application of the hardship standard to those facts is reviewable as a mixed question of law and fact, albeit under a deferential standard of review given the factual nature of the inquiry. The Third Circuit’s holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review hardship determinations was therefore erroneous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored an opinion concurring in the judgment, expressing skepticism that Congress intended the phrase “questions of law” in § 1252(a)(2)(D) to encompass all mixed questions of law and fact, as the majority concluded. However, she agreed with the majority’s judgment based on the controlling precedent of Guerrero-Lasprilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice John Roberts authored a dissenting opinion in which he agreed with Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent that while Guerrero-Lasprilla was correctly decided, the majority erred in this case by reading the language in that case too broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, arguing that the Court’s broad reading of “questions of law” in Guerrero-Lasprilla defies common sense and would result in the exception nearly swallowing the rule, which Congress could not have intended when it enacted §1252(a)(2)(B) and §1252(a)(2)(D). He contended that the hardship determination is overwhelmingly a factual question that should not be classified as a reviewable “question of law.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63630,"name":"Jaime A.

The trial court did not recognize the verdicts as repugnant and accepted them, but the Georgia Supreme Court held that the verdicts were repugnant and vacated the verdicts, remanding McElrath’s case for retrial. On remand, McElrath alleged that retrial was precluded on double jeopardy grounds, but the trial court denied his motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a second appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, McElrath argued that the court should have reversed rather than vacated his felony murder conviction in his previous appeal. He also challenges the trial court’s ruling on his double jeopardy claim, arguing that retrial on all of the counts is barred because the jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity on the malice murder count. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the lower court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibit a second prosecution for a crime of which a defendant was previously acquitted?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits a second prosecution for a crime of which a defendant was found by a jury to be not guilty by reason of insanity. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being tried or punished more than once for the same offense, establishing that a verdict of acquittal is final and prohibits any future prosecution for the same offense. An acquittal includes any decision demonstrating the prosecution’s failure to provide sufficient evidence for criminal liability, making such a verdict inviolable and irreversible. This principle is crucial, ensuring the finality and integrity of jury verdicts in protecting defendants’ rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, the jury’s verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity on a malice-murder charge constitutes an acquittal, because it signifies the insufficiency of the prosecution\u0027s evidence for criminal liability. Notwithstanding Georgia law to the contrary, the determination of an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes rests on federal law, rendering the state’s characterization non-binding. The validity of an acquittal remains unaffected by the consistency of jury verdicts or any speculation about the jury\u0027s reasoning, which is consistent with the jury’s exclusive domain to decide on guilt or innocence and the Double Jeopardy Clause’s outright prohibition on multiple prosecutions for the same offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Samuel Alito authored a concurring opinion to clarify that the Court’s decision does not express any view about whether a not-guilty verdict that is inconsistent with a verdict on another count and is not accepted by the trial judge constitutes an “acquittal” for double jeopardy purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63629,"name":"Richard A.

Importantly, they are private enterprises, not governmental entities, and thus are not subject to constitutional requirements for free speech. Users have no obligation to consume or contribute to the content on these platforms. And unlike traditional media, social-media platforms primarily host content created by individual users rather than the companies themselves (although they do engage in some speech of their own, such as publishing terms of service and community standards). They are not merely conduits of that content, however; they curate and edit the content that users see, which involves removing posts that violate community standards and prioritizing posts based on various factors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe State of Florida enacted S.B. 7072 to address what it perceives as bias and censorship by large social media platforms against conservative voices. The legislation imposes various restrictions and obligations on social media platforms, such as prohibiting the deplatforming of political candidates and requiring detailed disclosures about content moderation policies. It aims to treat social media platforms like common carriers and focuses on those platforms that either have annual gross revenues exceeding $100 million or at least 100 million monthly individual participants globally. Enforcement mechanisms include substantial fines and the option for civil suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetChoice and the Computer \u0026amp; Communications Industry Association (together, “NetChoice”)—are trade associations that represent internet and social-media companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google (which owns YouTube), and TikTok. They sued the Florida officials charged with enforcing S.B. 7072 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the law\u0027s provisions (1) violate the social-media companies’ right to free speech under the First Amendment and (2) are preempted by federal law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court granted NetChoice’s motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the provisions of the Act that make platforms liable for removing or deprioritizing content are likely preempted by federal law, specifically 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(2), and that the Act’s provisions infringe on platforms’ First Amendment rights by restricting their “editorial judgment.” The court applied strict scrutiny due to the Act\u0027s viewpoint-based purpose of defending conservative speech from perceived liberal bias in big tech. The court found that the Act does not survive strict scrutiny as it isn\u0027t narrowly tailored and doesn\u0027t serve a legitimate state interest. The State appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed these conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo Florida S.B. 7072’s content-moderation restrictions comply with the First Amendment, and do the law’s individualized-explanation requirements comply with the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63442,"name":"Henry C.

(2) Section 2, which requires platforms to disclose how they moderate and promote content, publish an \"acceptable use policy,\" and maintain a complaint-and-appeal system for their users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court issued a preliminary injunction, holding that Section 7 and Section 2 are facially unconstitutional. The court argued that social media platforms have some level of editorial discretion protected by the First Amendment, and HB 20 interferes with that discretion. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, rejecting the idea that large corporations have a “freewheeling” First Amendment right to censor what people say.

The regulatory agency, the Board of the Federal Reserve System, promulgated a rule (“Regulation II”) to govern these fees. Regulation II caps the fees that banks can charge for each debit card transaction. Petitioners in the case include Corner Post, a convenience store, the North Dakota Retail Association (NDRA), and the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers Association (NDPMA), all of whom accept debit card payments and are thus affected by interchange fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn April 29, 2021, the North Dakota Retail Association (NDRA) and the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers Association (NDPMA) challenged Regulation II as arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). After the Board moved to dismiss the case based on the statute of limitations, NDRA and NDPMA amended their complaint to add Corner Post, Inc. as an additional plaintiff. The district court dismissed the case, ruling that the 2015 clarification to Regulation II did not reset the statute of limitations, that Corner Post\u0027s statute of limitations began in 2011 with the original publication of Regulation II, and that none of the plaintiffs’ claims warranted equitable tolling.

The fee consists of two components: the “Highway 50 Component” and the “Local Road Component,” and is determined by the geographic zone in which the project is located and the type of construction proposed. The fee is mandatory regardless of the actual impact the project may have on existing or future roads. The TIM Fee Program stipulates that new developments bear the full cost of road construction and widening, even though these roads are used and benefitted from by existing residents and non-residents alike. In 2012, the County Board passed a resolution establishing new TIM Fee rates, which were subsequently applied to George Sheetz’s project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheetz applied for a building permit in July 2016 to construct a 1,854-square-foot manufactured house for his family. The County required him to pay $23,420 in traffic-mitigation fees based on the type and location of his project, even though no individualized assessment was made to correlate the fee with the project’s actual impact on local or state roads. Sheetz paid the fee under protest and later filed a legal action against the County, alleging the fee was an unconstitutional condition under the \u003cem\u003eNollan\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDolan\u003c/em\u003e standards and seeking a refund of the fee paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, “the government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right.” The U.S. Supreme Court in \u003cem\u003eNollan\u003c/em\u003e (1987) and \u003cem\u003eDolan\u003c/em\u003e (1994) recognized that land-use permit applicants “are especially vulnerable to the type of coercion that the unconstitutional conditions doctrine prohibits.” Under those cases, the government may condition approval of a land-use permit on the owner’s dedication of property to public use if the government can prove that an “essential nexus” and “rough proportionality” exist between the demanded property and the impacts of the owner’s project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe superior court ruled against Sheetz, concluding that legislative exactions are exempt from \u003cem\u003eNollan\u003c/em\u003e/\u003cem\u003eDolan\u003c/em\u003e review.

(MSI), a Florida corporation involved in the music industry. Nealy, a newcomer to the sector, financed the operation while Butler, an experienced disc jockey, authored or co-authored the musical works at the heart of the case. MSI released an album and several singles from 1983 to 1986 before dissolving as a corporation, although its business activities continued until 1989. During Nealy’s subsequent incarceration for drug offenses, Butler formed a new company, 321 Music, LLC, and began licensing rights to MSI’s musical works. This included an agreement in 2008 with Atlantic to interpolate one of MSI’s works into a song by artist Flo Rida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon his release, Nealy discovered third-party usage of MSI’s catalog but took no decisive action. He was unaware of ensuing litigation over the works among various entities including Warner Chappell Music, Inc., Artist Publishing Group, LLC, Atlantic Recording Corporation, and Butler\u0027s 321 Music. It wasn\u0027t until post-release from a second prison term that he learned of the prior litigation and alleged unauthorized transfers of rights. Finally, in December 2018, Nealy and MSI filed a lawsuit alleging copyright infringement by Atlantic, Artist, and Warner for activities dating back to 2008. Following a pre-trial stipulation framing the case as an “ownership dispute,” the defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted in part and denied in part. On an interlocutory appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that when a copyright plaintiff has a timely claim under the discovery accrual rule for infringement that occurred more than three years before the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff may recover damages for that infringement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the discovery accrual rule applied by the circuit courts and the Copyright Act’s statute of limitations for civil actions, 17 U.S.C. § 507(b), may a copyright plaintiff recover damages for acts that allegedly occurred more than three years before the filing of a lawsuit?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33978,"name":"Kannon K.

One of its most significant assets, International-Matex Tank Terminals (“IMTT”), was a substantial driver of its profit, with a major focus on storing No. 6 fuel oil. However, Macquarie and its leadership allegedly hid crucial information from investors, specifically about IMTT’s heavy reliance on No. 6 fuel oil, a commodity facing stringent upcoming regulations and declining demand. Even after international regulations on sulfur levels in fuel were confirmed to drastically affect the market for No. 6 fuel oil, the company continued to misrepresent its exposure, allegedly misleading investors about IMTT\u0027s flexibility and downplaying the impending effects on revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 21, 2018, Macquarie first announced a sharp decline in IMTT utilization, earnings falling short of analysts’ expectations, and a 31% cut to the company’s dividend. The company admitted for the first time that it would need to spend hundreds of millions to repurpose IMTT\u0027s storage tanks due to the declining demand for No. 6 fuel oil. As a result, the stock price plummeted, and Macquarie’s management faced a credibility crisis. Questions arose about the company’s transparency and honesty, harming investor trust and the company’s overall reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn behalf of a class of plaintiffs, Moab Partners, L.P., sued Macquarie, alleging that it made material omissions and false and misleading statements about IMTT in violation of various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, concluding that while many of the alleged misstatements are not actionable, the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded material omissions and facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a failure to make a disclosure required under Item 303 of SEC Regulation S-K support a private claim under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, even in the absence of an otherwise misleading statement?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34236,"name":"Linda T.

FBI agents questioned him about his ties to a mosque in Portland, Oregon, and informed him he was a flight risk. Fikre was offered removal from the list in exchange for becoming an FBI informant, an offer he declined. Subsequently, Fikre was imprisoned and tortured in the United Arab Emirates, allegedly at the request of the FBI. Unable to return to the U.S., Fikre sought asylum in Sweden, but was ultimately denied and returned to Portland via private jet after his petition to be removed from the No Fly List was also denied. While still in Sweden, Fikre filed a lawsuit against the FBI, claiming violation of his Fifth Amendment right to due process. While the lawsuit was pending, the FBI removed him from the No Fly List.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA federal district court in Oregon dismissed Fikre\u0027s case as moot, given that he had been removed from the No Fly List. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reinstated the lawsuit, stating that under the voluntary cessation doctrine, it was not “absolutely clear” that Fikre would not be placed back on the list for the same reasons. The case returned to the district court where an FBI official filed a declaration that Fikre would not be put back on the list based on current information. Despite this declaration, the court once again dismissed the case. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit again reversed, reasoning that the FBI’s declaration did not indicate a change in the policies or procedures that put Fikre on the list in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre respondent’s claims challenging his placement on the No Fly List moot, given that he was removed from the No Fly List in 2016 and the government provided a sworn declaration stating that he “will not be placed on the No Fly List in the future based on the currently available information”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Government failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that Mr. Fikre’s removal from the Government’s No Fly List mooted his 42 U.S.C. §1983 case because its declaration did not disclose the conduct that landed Mr. Fikre on the No Fly List and did not ensure that he would not be placed back on the list for engaging in the same or similar conduct in the future. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a court with jurisdiction is obligated to hear cases properly before it, it must also dismiss cases that have become moot. However, a defendant’s voluntary cessation of challenged conduct renders a case moot only if the defendant can show the conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur. This burden applies equally to governmental and private defendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the uncontested factual allegations at this stage of litigation, the government’s declaration that Fikre will not be relisted based on currently available information does not establish that he would not be relisted for engaging in the same or similar conduct in the future that allegedly led to his original placement on the No Fly List. What matters is not whether a defendant repudiates past actions, but what it can prove about its future conduct. Although this case is only in preliminary stages of the litigation, and relevant facts may emerge or change, under facts as alleged, the government failed to meet its burden of proving mootness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, wrote a concurring opinion to clarify that the Court’s opinion should not be understood as requiring the government to disclose classified information to prove mootness, as this could undermine significant national security interests. Rather, non-classified information or information obtained in discovery from the plaintiff in this and other cases may be sufficient to show that the allegedly unlawful listing is unlikely to recur, thereby proving mootness.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63131,"name":"Sopan Joshi","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sopan_joshi","view_count":0,"last_name":"Joshi","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"sopan_joshi"},"advocate_description":"for the Petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23498"},{"advocate":{"ID":63641,"name":"Gadeir Abbas","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/gadeir_abbas","view_count":0,"last_name":"Abbas","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"gadeir_abbas"},"advocate_description":"for the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23499"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":25555,"title":"Oral Argument - January 08, 2024","unavailable":false,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/25555"}],"citation":{"volume":"601","year":"2024","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27975"},"decisions":[{"description":"Respondent Fikre\u0027s claims are not moot.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":62836,"name":"Neil Gorsuch","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/neil_gorsuch","view_count":0,"last_name":"Gorsuch","roles":[{"id":3506,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":1491541200,"date_end":0,"appointing_president":"Donald J.

This dual system originated in 1978, with Alabama and North Carolina eventually gaining a permanent exemption from the Trustee Program in 2000. Both programs have different funding models, with the Trustee Program financed primarily through debtor fees and the Administrator Program funded through the general judicial budget. Over the years, Congress has enacted various amendments to balance the fee structures between the two systems, but disparities have remained, most notably with the 2017 Amendment which significantly raised fees in Trustee districts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventy-six Chapter 11 debtors associated with John Q.

The appellate court vacated one of the §924(c) counts but reinstated others, rejecting the petitioner\u0027s arguments. After a Supreme Court decision in United States v. Taylor, 596 U.S. __ (2022), which held that attempted Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) the Court granted certiorari, leading to a remand. However, the Second Circuit mostly upheld its prior rulings, making only minor changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a district court enter a criminal forfeiture order when the time limit specified in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure has already passed?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63660,"name":"Steven Y.

Two of the independent distributors for Flowers in Connecticut are Neal Bissonnette and Tyler Wojnarowski. Both entered into Distributor Agreements with Flowers in 2017 and 2018, respectively. According to these agreements, they pick up baked goods from local warehouses and distribute them to stores and restaurants, earning the difference between the acquisition and selling prices. They are also responsible for sales promotion, stock management, and other operational tasks. While they can sell non-competitive products, they primarily work full-time for Flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Distributor Agreement includes an appended Arbitration Agreement, which states that any disputes must be submitted to binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, except for certain specified issues. Pursuant to that arbitration agreement, the district court compelled arbitration. Bissonnette and Wojnarowski claimed that they are not subject to the FAA because they are “transportation workers” within the meaning of Section 1 of the FAA, which excludes contracts with “seamen, railroad employees, [and] any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision ordering arbitration and dismissing Plaintiff’s lawsuit against Defendant for unpaid or withheld wages, unpaid overtime wages, and unjust enrichment, concluding that Bissonnette and Wojnarowski did not qualify as transportation workers because they were not employed by a company in the transportation industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eTo be exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act, must a class of workers that is actively engaged in interstate transportation also be employed by a company in the transportation industry?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":63035,"name":"Jennifer D.

Despite initial claims of low addiction risk, growing evidence of widespread abuse led to legal battles across the United States, with multiple stakeholders including individuals, state governments, and federal agencies suing Purdue. In 2004, the board of Purdue entered into an expansive Indemnity Agreement to protect its directors and officers from financial liability related to lawsuits. This protection was especially broad, extending even after their official tenure at Purdue, but contained a bad faith carveout. From 2007 onwards, the Sacklers began shielding assets, anticipating litigation against them personally. By 2019, Purdue faced weakened financial prospects, and the Sacklers had stepped down from the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same year, the DOJ brought criminal and civil charges against Purdue, resulting in a plea agreement in 2020 that prioritized the DOJ’s claims in Purdue’s bankruptcy proceedings. The plea stipulated a $2 billion forfeiture judgment but allowed for the release of $1.775 billion if certain conditions were met. Although Purdue declared bankruptcy in 2019, the Sacklers did not, and litigation against both parties was temporarily halted. The estate of Purdue is estimated to be around $1.8 billion, while claims against both Purdue and the Sacklers are estimated to exceed $40 trillion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York confirmed a proposed bankruptcy plan on September 17, 2021. This plan included a “shareholder release” that, in effect, permanently enjoined certain third-party claims against the Sacklers. Several parties objected to the plan, but the bankruptcy court rejected their claims. On appeal to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the district court overturned the bankruptcy court\u0027s confirmation, holding that the Bankruptcy Code does not allow for the forced release of direct claims against non-debtors. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court’s order holding that the Bankruptcy Code does not permit nonconsensual third-party releases of direct claims, and affirmed the bankruptcy court’s approval of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Bankruptcy Code authorize a court to approve, as part of a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a release that extinguishes claims held by non-debtors against non-debtor third parties, without the claimants’ consent?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19038,"name":"Curtis E.

National banks are subject to federal authority and have broad powers, including the ability to make real estate loans and provide escrow services. Alongside the NBA, other significant federal statutes regulate national banks: The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) limits the amount banks can require borrowers to deposit into escrow accounts related to home mortgages; the Dodd-Frank Act sets the standards for when state consumer financial laws are preempted by federal law; and it also amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to require the creation of escrow accounts for certain mortgages and mandates interest payment on those accounts if prescribed by state or federal law. The state law in question, New York General Obligations Law (GOL) § 5-601, mandates a minimum interest rate for escrow accounts held by mortgage institutions, which was later adjusted in 2018 to create “parity” between state-chartered and national banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Cantero purchased a house in Queens Village, New York, with a mortgage from Bank of America (BOA) in August 2010. His mortgage required him to deposit money into an escrow account for property taxes and insurance premiums, and BOA paid no interest on these funds. Cantero’s mortgage specified that it is governed by federal law and the law of the property’s jurisdiction. Cantero alleged that BOA refused to pay interest on escrow funds, contrary to New York State law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court determined that New York\u0027s General Obligations Law (GOL) § 5-601, was not preempted by the NBA based on its minimal “degree of interference” with national banking powers. Citing Dodd-Frank’s amendment to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) as supportive of this compatibility, the court denied BOA’s motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim, asserting that both federal and state laws could be read “harmoniously.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, concluding that the NBA does preempt New York’s GOL because the minimum-interest requirement would exert control over a banking power granted by the federal government, thereby impermissibly interfering with national banks’ exercise of that power.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the National Bank Act preempt the application of state escrow-interest laws to national banks?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33318,"name":"Jonathan E.

During her campaign, she learned of widespread dissatisfaction with the current city manager. After taking office, she organized a nonbinding petition calling for the manager\u0027s removal. The petition was presented at a contentious council meeting, after which Mayor Edward Trevino questioned Gonzalez about the petition\u0027s location, found in her binder. Two days later, Trevino initiated a criminal complaint against Gonzalez for allegedly stealing the petition. Despite an atypical legal process involving Chief-of-Police John Siemens and special detective Alex Wright, Gonzalez was arrested and spent a night in jail. She is no longer on the council and has refrained from public political activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGonzalez sued Trevino, Siemens, Wright, and the city (collectively, the Defendants) for violating her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. She argued that the arrest was in retaliation for engaging in conduct protected by the First Amendment, but she conceded that there was probable cause for the arrest. In support of her retaliation claim, she cited a decade-long review of misdemeanor and felony data in Bexar County that showed no similar cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Defendants moved to dismiss her lawsuit on grounds of the independent-intermediary doctrine and qualified immunity, but the district court allowed Gonzalez’s claims to proceed. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding that the outcome was controlled by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Nieves v. Bartlett, holding that, in general, the existence of probable cause will defeat a retaliatory arrest claim. The Fifth Circuit noted that Gonzalez’s facts did not trigger the narrow exception recognized in Nieves, under which a plaintiff need not plead lack of probable cause “where officers have probable cause to make arrests, but typically exercise their discretion not to do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1.

This provision aims to treat future claimants equitably, given the long latency period of some asbestos-related illnesses, while also enabling the debtor to exit bankruptcy as a viable economic entity. To obtain relief under this section, the debtor must meet several criteria designed to protect the due process rights of claimants, especially future ones. These criteria include the appointment of a representative for future claimants and court determination that the plan is fair to both current and future claimants. Additionally, 75% of current claimants must vote to approve the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the face of over 38,000 asbestos-related lawsuits since 1978, Kaiser Gypsum Company, Inc., and Hanson Permanente Cement, Inc., collectively known as the \"Debtors,\" filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2016. As part of their proposed reorganization Plan, the Debtors negotiated with multiple parties—including insurance companies, creditors, government agencies, and representatives of both current and future asbestos claimants—to establish a § 524(g) trust. This trust aimed to channel both existing and future asbestos-related claims away from the Debtors. The trust\u0027s financial viability heavily depended on primary liability insurance policies issued by Truck Insurance Exchange (\"Truck\") between the 1960s and 1980s, which obligated Truck to investigate and defend each asbestos claim against the Debtors up to a per-claim limit of $500,000. The Debtors would assign their rights under these Truck policies to the § 524(g) trust as part of the Plan\u0027s funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruck opposed the Plan, arguing it failed to provide anti-fraud measures for insured claims that would be litigated in the tort system, thereby potentially exposing Truck to fraudulent claims. Despite Truck\u0027s objections, the bankruptcy court recommended confirmation of the Plan, finding it to be \"insurance neutral\" and therefore not impacting Truck\u0027s rights or obligations under the existing policies. The district court upheld this decision, confirming the Plan and thereby nullifying Truck\u0027s objections. Importantly, 100% of the asbestos personal-injury claimants had approved the proposed Plan, making Truck the sole objector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court confirmed the Plan over Truck’s objections, finding Truck lacked standing to challenge the Plan because it was not a “party in interest” under § 1109(b).

The MSA sets up regional councils, including the New England Fishery Management Council, which oversees the Atlantic herring fishery. These councils create fishery management plans (FMPs) to set conservation measures, which must align with ten National Standards and other laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), reviews and publishes these plans for public comment. In 2000, the New England Council established an FMP for Atlantic herring, updated with an industry-funded monitoring program in 2020. The program partially shifts the cost of at-sea monitoring to vessel owners but aims for a 50% target of monitored herring trips, which will cause reduced profits for the fishing industry and communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwners of two fishing vessels, Relentless Inc., Huntress Inc., and Seafreeze Fleet LLC, challenged the Rule, arguing that the monitoring requirement disproportionately burdens them because of their longer trips and inability to qualify for exemptions.

Following the October 1, 2017 Las Vegas shooting, where a shooter used bump stocks in a massacre, public demand for a ban on bump stocks surged, leading to proposed legislation. Before Congress could act, the ATF, responding to the tragedy and public sentiment, reversed its stance in 2018, reclassifying bump stocks as machineguns and exposing owners to criminal liability. Respondent Michael Cargill surrendered his bump stocks due to this new regulation and filed a lawsuit challenging the ATF regulations, arguing that the ATF exceeded its authority in defining bump stocks as machineguns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court for the government, finding that the government’s new interpretation of “machinegun” is the best interpretation of the statute. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, but on rehearing, the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc reversed.

Vullo, initiated an investigation into NRA-endorsed insurance programs suspected of violating New York law. This scrutiny resulted in three insurance companies acknowledging their fault through consent decrees in 2018. Concurrently, after the Parkland school shooting, Vullo issued guidance and statements encouraging banks and insurers to assess and potentially end their affiliations with gun promotion organizations like the NRA, citing reputational risks. The fallout led to several firms cutting ties with the NRA, prompting the association to file a lawsuit against Vullo and other state officials, asserting violations of its free speech and equal protection rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court dismissed most of the claims but allowed the First Amendment allegations against Vullo to proceed, citing unresolved factual questions about her qualified immunity. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. The appellate court reasoned that while the First Amendment protects against the abridgment of free speech by government officials, these officials also have the responsibility to address public concerns. Here, the NRA failed to show that Vullo’s conduct sought to coerce, rather than merely to convince. Furthermore, even if her actions were coercive, Vullo’s conduct as a regulator and public official did not infringe upon any clearly established law, as she appeared to act reasonably and in good faith in performing her duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a New York regulator’s discouragement of companies from doing business with the National Rifle Association after the Parkland school shooting constitute coercion in violation of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20648,"name":"David D.

To enhance tribal sovereignty, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA), allowing tribes to administer their healthcare programs. These programs were funded by the IHS, equivalent to what IHS would spend on tribal healthcare. However, tribes faced financial challenges in running these programs due to the lack of bureaucratic and legal support available to the federal government. To address this, Congress mandated IHS to provide tribes with contract support costs (CSC), ensuring they could offer services at par with IHS. Despite this assistance, tribes still struggled with parity issues with IHS, primarily due to slow billing processes and imperfect remittance of funds by IHS. To remedy this, Congress permitted tribes to bill outside insurers directly and retain the third-party revenue, which the Tribe was required to spend on healthcare. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, exercising its sovereignty in Arizona, managed its healthcare programs and billed outside insurers directly. However, the Tribe encountered difficulties in funding the additional healthcare services from third-party revenue without corresponding CSC from IHS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tribe sued the U.S. Department of Health \u0026amp; Human Services, IHS, and the United States, for the CSC for the years 2011–2013. The district court dismissed the Tribe’s claim for the third-party-revenue-funded portions of the Tribe’s healthcare program from CSC reimbursement, and the Tribe appealed.

This sentence was based on his three prior convictions for violent felonies, all being Indiana burglaries. Erlinger challenged his sentence on two grounds. First, he argued that Indiana’s definition of burglary extends beyond the federal statute, making it non-applicable as a predicate offense under ACCA. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted that Indiana\u0027s definition of burglary is “[a] person who breaks and enters the building or structure of another person, with intent to commit a felony in it.” Ind. Code § 35-43-2-1 (1990) is no broader than the federal definition of general burglary, which is “an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, Erlinger argued that these burglaries did not occur on separate occasions, and claimed that the determination of this fact should be made by a jury, not a judge, as per the Sixth Amendment and the Supreme Court’s decision in Wooden v. United States (2022). The Seventh Circuit disagreed, finding that under binding circuit precedent, the government was not required to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Erlinger committed the Indiana burglaries on separate occasions, only to the sentencing judge by a preponderance of the evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Constitution require a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt to find that a defendant’s prior convictions were “committed on occasions different from one another,” as is necessary to impose an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30283,"name":"Jeffrey L.

At the border, a “crunch-like sound” was heard when she rolled down the car window, leading the border agent to call for backup and check the car\u0027s door panels using a density measuring device. Inspectors found 27.98 kilos of methamphetamine hidden in these panels. Diaz claimed she was unaware of the drugs in the car, explaining that she had initially traveled to Mexico with her daughter, who returned early. Diaz stayed back to visit her boyfriend, and used his car to return home. She stated her boyfriend had told her he would retrieve the car from her in a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government charged Diaz with importation of methamphetamine in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. One of the elements of that offense is that the defendant knew she was transporting drugs. 21 U.S.C. § 960(a)(1). To prove that element, the government called an expert to testify that “narcotic traffickers do not entrust large and valuable quantities of narcotics to unknowing couriers.” Diaz sought to exclude the expert evidence, arguing that it would violate Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b) by providing “a direct comment on the ultimate issue—Ms. Diaz’s knowledge.” However, the district court allowed the evidence, the jury found Diaz guilty, and the district court sentenced her to seven years in prison.

A violent altercation ensued, resulting in Jones fatally striking Weaver with a baseball bat. Jones also attacked Weaver’s grandmother, Katherine Gumina, and his seven-year-old daughter, Tisha, the latter of whom he also strangled or suffocated. Jones fled to Las Vegas but was arrested and indicted in Arizona on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. His public defender, inexperienced in capital cases, received limited funding for expert witnesses. Jones was convicted on all counts, and a sentencing hearing was scheduled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt sentencing, testimony revealed Jones’s troubled childhood, including substance abuse, head injuries, and abuse by his first stepfather. Dr. Jack Potts, a forensic psychiatrist, assessed Jones, citing a history of substance abuse, possible mood disorders, and susceptibility to aggression due to drug use. Potts’s report, submitted late due to delayed receipt of the Presentence Information Report, suggested Jones’s impaired capacity to conform to the law at the time of the offenses. Despite a request for a continuance for further psychological testing, the judge found multiple aggravating factors for the murders and sentenced Jones to death for both murders and an additional twenty-five years for the attempted murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arizona Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence, and Jones filed a federal petition for habeas relief. After protracted litigation and appeals, the district court dismissed Jones’s habeas petition.

Chiaverini advised them to report to the police but denied buying their described items. After multiple calls, Chiaverini ended the conversation. Both parties contacted the police. Chiaverini expressed his suspicion about holding stolen property and requested police, not the Hills, to visit.

Mifepristone was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2000 and is used in over half of all U.S. abortions. Initially, its distribution was limited to hospitals and medical facilities under FDA regulations. The 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act introduced Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), reinforcing FDA\u0027s control over drug approvals. Despite REMS review in 2011, mifepristone\u0027s distribution remained restricted. In March 2016, the FDA expanded access, allowing medical practitioners to prescribe it and extending the usage period in pregnancy. In April 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA permitted mail distribution from certified sources, and in January 2023, approved pharmacies also began distributing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, following the Supreme Court\u0027s June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u0027s Health Organization, which eliminated the constitutional right to abortion, several states sought to restrict mifepristone’s sale. The Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and other anti-abortion groups challenged the FDA’s approval, claiming inadequate consideration of evidence in 2000. In April 2023, a federal district court judge sided with the plaintiffs, suspending the FDA’s approval. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit partially stayed this decision, maintaining the original 2000 approval but striking down the 2016 REMS changes that eased access. After a hearing on the merits, in August 2023, the Fifth Circuit upheld the ban on changes made in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court granted review and stayed the lower court’s injunction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1.

Additionally, each faced a count of obstruction of an official proceeding. The defendants challenged this obstruction charge, claiming that the statute does not prohibit their alleged conduct on that day. The district court agreed, holding that the statute does not apply to assaultive conduct, committed in furtherance of an attempt to stop Congress from performing a constitutionally required duty.

In the 2020 election, Joe Biden was elected as the 46th President, despite Trump\u0027s refusal to accept the results. The Electoral College confirmed Biden\u0027s victory with 306 votes to Trump\u0027s 232. Trump continued to challenge the outcome in court and media. On January 6, 2021, during a Congressional session to certify the election, Trump held a rally, claiming victory and urging supporters to protest at the Capitol. The next day, Vice President Pence certified Biden\u0027s win. Trump is currently seeking the Colorado Republican Party’s nomination for the 2024 presidential election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of Colorado electors, consisting of both registered Republicans and unaffiliated voters, filed a petition in the Denver District Court to prevent Trump from appearing on the Colorado Republican presidential primary ballot. Citing Colorado’s Uniform Election Code, they requested the court to direct Secretary of State Jena Griswold to exclude Trump’s name. Their argument centered on Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment, claiming Trump was disqualified due to his involvement in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, violating his presidential oath to support the U.S. Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe court found by clear and convincing evidence that Trump engaged in insurrection as those terms are used in Section Three but that Section Three does not apply to the president. Thus, the court denied the petition. On appeal, the Colorado Supreme Court reversed in part, concluding that Section Three disqualifies Trump from holding the office of President of the United States and thus that it would be unlawful under Colorado law to list him on the ballot.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualify Donald Trump from holding the office of President of the United States and thus from appearing on Colorado’s 2024 presidential primary ballot?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWhile states have the power to disqualify state officials under Section 3, they lack the authority to enforce Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates. In a per curiam (unsigned) opinion, the Court reversed the Colorado Supreme Court decision that had excluded former President Donald Trump from the state\u0027s 2024 Republican primary ballot based on Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Constitution does not delegate to the states any power to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices. The Fourteenth Amendment itself only speaks to enforcement by Congress under Section 5, and it would be incongruous to read the Amendment as silently granting enforcement power to the states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elections and Electors Clauses also do not implicitly authorize states to enforce Section 3 against federal candidates. Historically, it has been Congress, not the states, that has enforced Section 3 against federal officeholders. Allowing states to do so could lead to conflicting and disruptive outcomes in federal elections, especially presidential elections. Responsibility for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates rests solely with Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Amy Coney Barrett authored an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, pointing out that the Court did not need to decide the question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced. Justice Barrett argued that resolving that more complicated question would and did “amplify disagreement . . . in the volatile season of a Presidential election”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson co-authored an opinion concurrring in the judgment but arguing that the Court departed from the principle of judicial restraint, which calls for deciding only as much as necessary to dispose of the issues in a case. By going further and announcing “novel rules” for how federal enforcement of Section 3 must operate, such as requiring specific legislation enacted by Congress, the majority unnecessarily decided momentous constitutional questions not before the Court, effectively limiting future efforts to disqualify presidential candidates under Section 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31992,"name":"Jonathan F.

This provision necessitates that “upwind” states mitigate emissions that could affect air quality in “downwind” states. Following this, states were required to submit plans indicating how they would meet these standards and reduce emissions impacting other states. However, the EPA rejected the plans from 21 states for proposing no changes and additionally addressed two states that had failed to submit plans. In response, it published a federal plan mandating power plants and other industrial facilities in these 23 states to implement existing controls more effectively from 2023 and adopt commonly used controls by 2026, along with requiring controls for other ozone pollution sources like cement kilns and industrial boilers. The plan also utilized an existing emissions trading program among the affected states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis federal intervention sparked a legal challenge from three states, several companies, and trade associations, requesting a court to temporarily block the EPA rule.

These supporters argued that delaying the rule’s enforcement would critically impede efforts in environmental protection and public health.

The Court declined, deferring instead to the D.C. Circuit’s judgment. On February 6, the D.C. Circuit upheld Chutkan’s decision, and Trump requested a stay of the D.C. Circuit’s ruling.
