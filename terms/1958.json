Guadalupe was docked in Hoboken, NJ, a cable struck Francisco Romero and seriously him.  He sued for negligence under the Jones act and maritime law.  The Jones Act provides jurisdiction for claims under the Constitution and treaties of the U.S. for persons of diverse citizenship.  Both Romero and his employer were aliens, so there was no diversity of citizenship.  Also, the maritime laws did not arise from the Constitution or treaties of the U.S..  The district court dismissed all claims for lack of jurisdiction.  The district court also held that Romero could receive adequate remedies under Spanish law.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Do U.S. courts have jurisdiction to decide the matter under the Jones Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Do U.S. courts have the authority to decide maritime law matters?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. In a 7-2 decision, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote the majority opinion vacating the judgment below and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that the district court confused jurisdiction with stating a valid cause of action.  The district court had jurisdiction to determine whether Romero had stated a valid cause of action under the Jones Act and pendant jurisdiction joins the general maritime law claims.  The Court also found that U.S. maritime law does not apply as a matter of law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan wrote a partial dissent, stating that he could not agree with the majority that the court did not have independent jurisdiction over maritime law.  Chief Justice Earl Warren joined in the partial dissent.  Justice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent, expressing that maritime laws are independently within the jurisdiction of the federal courts and that the Jones Act does apply.  Justice William O. Douglas joined in the dissent. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37238,"name":"Narciso Puente, Jr.","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/narciso_puente_jr","view_count":0,"last_name":"Puente,","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"narciso_puente_jr"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20989"},{"advocate":{"ID":40918,"name":"Silas B.

The Darlington, Inc., a corporation formed in 1949, obtained FHA mortgage insurance for a building in Charleston, South Carolina. Although The Darlington, Inc. submitted the required reports of its monthly rental rates for each of the units, the reports never mentioned the fact that an affiliate of the corporation was renting fully furnished rooms on a daily basis. The affiliate continued to rent these transient apartments after an amendment to the Act specifically excluded such units from eligibility for federal mortgage insurance. The FHA stopped insuring the mortgages because The Darlington, Inc. violated the terms of the Act. The Darlington, Inc. sued the FHA for a declaratory judgment and claimed to still be eligible as long as the building was used for “principally” residential purposes. The district court granted relief. On appeal, the Court remanded the case to a three-judge panel. The panel affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Veterans’ Emergency Housing Act of 1946 allow mortgage companies to rent to transients?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the 5-3 majority. The Court held that the intent of the Act was to provide housing for veterans, which implies a degree of permanency. Previous interpretation by the FHA also understood the Act to exclude transient occupancy. The Court also held that the addition of the exclusion to the Act after the FHA contracted to ensure the mortgages was not unfair to The Darlington, Inc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a dissent arguing that the majority’s opinion constituted an “unconstitutional retroactive application” of the new exclusions in the Act. He also argued that there was no language in the Act that expressly prohibited The Darlington, Inc. from renting to transients, so the corporation’s actions violated neither the letter nor the intent of the Act. Justice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Charles E. Whittaker joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a separate dissent, Justice Felix Frankfurter argued that the later changes to the Act did not negate the rights of mortgage companies to rent to transients that existed under the previous construction of the Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16789,"name":"Alan S.

On September 3, 1956, Hereford told Marsh that James Draper had recently moved to Denver and was dealing drugs. Four days later, Hereford informed Marsh that Draper had gone to Chicago to pick up heroin and would be returning by train on either the morning of September 8 or 9. Hereford also provided a detailed description of Draper and the bag he would likely be carrying. On September 9, Marsh and a Denver police agent saw a person exactly matching that description exit a train from Chicago. Marsh and the police officer stopped him and arrested him. In his pocket they found two envelopes containing heroin, and they found a syringe in his bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore his trial, Draper moved to suppress the evidence of the drugs and the syringe as having been secured through an unlawful search and seizure. The district court dismissed the motion after finding that the officers had probable cause to arrest Draper without a warrant and therefore the evidence was the fruit of a lawful search. Draper was tried and convicted of knowingly concealing and transporting drugs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes knowledge provided by an informant give the police probable cause under the Fourth Amendment to arrest and search a suspect?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Charles E. Whittaker delivered the opinion of the 6-1 majority. The Supreme Court held that evidence required to show probable cause is not held to the same standard as evidence required to prove guilt in trial. Despite the fact that information Marsh gained from Hereford would be inadmissible at trial as hearsay, it may still be relied on as probable cause for a search and arrest. The Court also held that, because Marsh was able to personally verify the description Hereford had given, he had “reasonable grounds” to believe that the information regarding the heroin was also correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that an arrest made on the word of an informant violates the spirit of the Fourth Amendment because it allows the police latitude to arrest innocent people without sufficient proof. He argued that an interpretation of the Fourth Amendment to allow arrests based on suspicion goes against the entire history of American jurisprudence and the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Felix Frankfurter did not participate in the discussion or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37445,"name":"Osmond K.

Townley, a legally qualified candidate in the 1956 United States Senate race in North Dakota. The speech was broadcast uncensored as a reply to previous speeches made by two other Senate candidates. Townley’s speech accused the other candidates and the Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union of America of conspiring to establish “a Communist Farmers Union Soviet.” Farmers Union sued Townley and WDAY, Inc for libel in district court. The court dismissed the complaint against WDAY, Inc. and held that the Federal Communications Act of 1934 granted the station immunity from liability for such defamation. The Supreme Court of North Dakota affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Federal Communications Act of 1934 prohibit a broadcasting station from removing defamatory statements in speeches broadcast by legally qualified candidates for office?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, does the station have federal immunity from liability for libelous statements in the broadcast?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. Justice Hugo L. Black delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the censorship prohibited by the Federal Communications Act of 1934 was defined broadly and included the removal of objectionable material from a political speech. Permitting broadcasting stations to engage in this type of censorship would undermine the purpose the Act was meant to serve. The Court also held that holding the station liable for any defamatory statement made during the broadcast of a political speech would allow liability for conduct that the statute requires. While Congress did not explicitly include station immunity in the Act, the Federal Communications Commission, the body in charge of administering the Act, has long upheld the doctrine of station immunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter dissented and argued that, unless Congress explicitly granted stations immunity from state libel laws, state law trumps any implied federal immunity. Since Congress has not granted any explicit immunity, and the legislative history does not indicate that they intended to do so, the state laws stand. He also argued that the precedent set by the Court supports the state unless federal laws explicitly intercede. Justice John M. Harlan, Justice Charles E. Whittaker, and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22352,"name":"Edward S.

The Office’s commission was coming to an end, and the plan involved firing and rehiring employees on a temporary basis until the life of the Office was extended or ended.  William G. Barr, general manager of the Office, vehemently opposed the plan, and several Senators attacked the plan on the Senate floor.  Barr decided to suspend Matteo and Madigan.  He issued a press release explaining his reasons.  Matteo and Madigan sued for libel based on the statements in the press release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In certain circumstances, government officials are protected from civil suits for actions done in the scope of their official duties though absolute or qualified privilege. The district court ruled in favor of Matteo and Madigan, rejecting Barr’s claim that his statements were protected by privilege.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, considering only absolute privilege.  The U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded so the court of appeals could consider qualified privilege.  On remand, the court of appeals held that qualified privilege existed, but was defeated due to Barr’s malice.  The court remanded the case to district court for a new trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the absolute privilege granted to government officials for acts done in the scope of their official authority extend to statements to the press about matters under their supervision?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice John M. Harlan delivered the judgement of the court, reversing the court of appeals.  The plurality argued that the statements from the press release were absolutely privileged.  Justice Felix Frankfurter, Justice Tom C. Clark, and Justice Charles E. Whittaker joined in the plurality.  Justice Hugo L. Black concurred in the reversal, writing that that the press release was not unauthorized or beyond the scope of Barr’s official business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren dissented, arguing that absolute privilege should not extend to lower level officials like Barr, and qualified privilege should only apply to statements to the public.  Justice William O. Douglas joined in the dissent.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. also dissented, arguing that only qualified privilege applied.  Justice Potter Stewart dissented, writing that Barr acted beyond the scope of his job duties when he issued the press release, so privilege did not apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20837,"name":"Daniel M.

The Court reasoned that the Navajo Courts of Indian Offenses exercised broad criminal and civil jurisdiction that covered suits by outsiders against Native American defendants. Federal law granted states the power to assume jurisdiction over reservation matters if the state legislature or the people affirmatively accepted the responsibility, and Arizona expressly disclaimed such jurisdiction. The Court concluded that the Navajo Treaty of 1868 controlled, and civil jurisdiction resided with the reservation\u0027s courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13675,"title":"Oral Argument - November 20, 1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13675"}],"citation":{"volume":"358","page":"217","year":"1959","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24559"},"decisions":[{"description":"The jurisdiction of state courts does not extend to Indian reservations unless Congress specifically permits.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Brown refused to answer questions asked by the grand jury, invoking the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.  The district judge ordered Brown to answer the questions, telling him that the FMCA provided immunity against any prosecution that might arise from Brown’s testimony.  Brown still refused to answer.  After several failed attempts to make Brown answer the questions, the judge held him in contempt of court and sentenced him to 15 months in prison.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court judge abuse his discretion when he sentenced Brown to 15 months in prison?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a 5-4 majority, affirmed the conviction.  The Supreme Court held that the FMCA clearly provided Brown with immunity from prosecution based on his testimony.  Because he could not possibly incriminate himself, he could not invoke the Fifth Amendment.  There was no statutory cap on sentencing, so 15 months was not an abuse of discretion.\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren dissented, arguing that the district judge denied Brown due process by following Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 49(a) instead of 49(b).  Under 49(b) Brown would be sentenced to prison until he agreed to answer the questions instead of a fixed 15 month sentence. Justice Hugo L. Black, Justice William O. Douglas, and Justice William J.

Beacon Theatre opened a drive-in theater in the area and threatened to sue Fox West Coast over their \"first-run\" contracts claiming they violated antitrust laws, in particular the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act. Fox West Coast filed an injunction against Beacon taking legal action, and Beacon counterclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lower court denied Beacon a trial by jury because the suit involved both matters of law and equitable damages. Beacon appealed this decision on the grounds that the alleged competition between Beacon and Fox West Coast was a matter of fact to be decided by a jury pursuant to the Seventh Amendment. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court’s decision. Beacon responded by seeking a writ of mandamus.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a case involving both equitable claims and legal claims have a right to trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black delivered the opinion of the 5-3 majority. The Court held that a case involving both equitable and legal claims must be tried by jury before the equitable damages can be accessed. Therefore, Beacon Theatre had a Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury. Fox West Coast’s injunction for permanent relief from Beacon could be assessed after the jury verdict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart (joined by Justice John M. Harlan and Justice Charles E. Whittaker) wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the Court should have denied the writ of mandamus because the issues of this case were questions of law rather than fact, and that the trial judge should be granted deference.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29617,"name":"Jack Corinblit","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_corinblit","view_count":0,"last_name":"Corinblit","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_corinblit"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21428"},{"advocate":{"ID":24144,"name":"Frank R.

The National Labor Relations Board, however, had a stated policy of refusing jurisdiction over hotel employees. Hence, the union did not petition the board for an election or certification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn March, the union tried to establish a procedure to collectively bargain for the employees of the various hotels. It could not reach an agreement between the employee representatives from each hotel, so it addressed a letter to the Miami Beach Hotel Association requesting a conference. It also sent copies to each hotel and published copies in local newspapers. The Association -- which was not specifically authorized to bargain for its members -- did not answer the union’s request. In response, on April 13, 1955, the union began a strike at nine hotels, including the Sherry Frontenac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotels filed for an injunction against the picketers. Of the nine cases, the district court tried seven separately, with each judge retaining jurisdiction over his particular case. In each of the seven cases, the trial judge held that there was not enough evidence of violence to justify enjoining the picketing on that basis. Before each court could address whether the unions were coercing hotel employees to unionize, however, the Florida Supreme Court intervened. On the basis of the hotels’ complaint, it held that the real purpose of the strike was indeed to coerce hotel employees to join the union, in violation of Florida law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Florida Supreme Court properly enjoin union hotel employees from picketing at twelve Miami resort hotels where the action was not under the explicit jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that the Florida Supreme Court did not properly enjoin the union employees from picketing the resort hotels. The Court held that the strike\u0027s status under the National Labor Relations Act did not control the case. Instead, the Court looked to whether or not any violence resulted from the picketers’ activities. It held that none of the district courts made any finding of violence sufficient to merit an injunction from the Florida Supreme Court. The Court determined that it was not necessary to consider whether interstate commerce was involved in the Florida resort hotel industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15044,"name":"Arthur J.

William had two life insurance policies issued by the New York Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation, payable to his wife. Each contained a double indemnity clause preventing payment if William\u0027s death resulted from “self-destruction, whether sane or insane.” On January 20, 1955, between 10:30 and 11:00 am, Blanche entered the farm’s silage shed and found her husband lying on his back. She saw a wound on his head and knew he was dead; William\u0027s double-barreled shotgun was lying near his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe county sheriff later determined that the shotgun was held about eighteen inches from William\u0027s body with the stock toward the feet and the barrel along the body when it was fired. He also determined that the gun likely did not fire from a person jarring, pounding, or dropping it, although there was also evidence that the gun had occasionally discharged accidentally in the past. Dr. Veitch, the county coroner, found another wound in William\u0027s chest, but determined that it was the wound to William\u0027s head that caused his immediate death; the chest wound likely only resulted in a great deal of pain. Dr. Veitch, who was also William\u0027s personal physician, testified that William had mild to moderate non-specific prostatitis, which left him tired but did not prevent him from doing farm work. William did not apparently leave a suicide note or mention suicide to his relatives or friends. In connection with Blanche\u0027s later claim for benefits, however, Dr. Veitch listed the cause of death as “suicide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew York Life Insurance filed an action in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, claiming that William committed suicide. Under North Dakota law, proof of insurance coverage and death by gunshot wound shifted the burden to the insurer to prove that the death was not accidental. The jury found for Blanche Dick and awarded $7,500 in damages. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, reviewed the evidence and determined that the shotgun could not have fired unless someone or something pushed or pulled one of the triggers. It further concluded that the evidence could not be reconciled with any reasonable theory that the shooting was accidental, given William\u0027s experience as a hunter and the multiple gunshot wounds on his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Eighth Circuit United States Court of Appeals properly reverse the district court’s determination that the cause of William Dick’s death was a question of fact for the jury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-2 decision written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court held that the Fourth Circuit erred in reversing the judgment of the district court. Chief Justice Warren argued that the jury could have determined that William Dick\u0027s death was accidental from the evidence Blanche Dick presented at trial, emphasizing that the evidence apparently did not suggest that William had either the motive or intention to commit suicide. He also noted that William was in the middle of his chores when he died, which the jury could have reasonably concluded to be improbable timing for a suicide attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren declined to answer whether a state or federal evidentiary standard is proper when jurisdiction is based on the diversity of the parties because both parties assumed the North Dakota standard was proper in their briefs and arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart concurred, agreeing that the district court properly applied North Dakota’s evidentiary standard. Justice Stewart noted that he was not a member of the court when the case was granted a writ of certiorari, and thus refrained from expressing an opinion on whether the Court granted the writ appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter, joined by Justice Charles Whittaker, dissented. He argued that the Court improperly granted a writ of certiorari to Blanche Dick’s case. Justice Frankfurter outlined the history of diversity jurisdiction cases in the circuit courts, emphasizing that congress intended the Court to use its certiorari power sparingly in such cases. He argued that the Eighth Circuit properly applied North Dakota’s evidentiary standard and concluded that Blanche\u0027s claim fell short of the North Dakota requirements for submission to a jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38406,"name":"Philip B.

Later that night, Spano acquired a gun, found Palermo, and killed him. On February 1, 1957, a grand jury indicted Spano for first-degree murder and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Two days later, Spano called Gaspar Bruno, a longtime friend of his who was enrolled in the police academy. During that conversation, Spano told Bruno that Palermo had been beaten up in a fight, he was dazed, and he shot at Palermo. The next day, Spano turned himself in but refused to answer officers’ questions. The police questioned him for several hours before they brought in Spano’s friend Bruno to play on their friendship in order to convince Spano to confess, which he eventually did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe confession was admitted into evidence at trial, and the jury was instructed to consider it only if it was found to be voluntary. The jury found Spano guilty and sentenced him to death. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the admission of Spano’s confession violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the interrogation tactics the police used -- such as questioning Spano for hours without a break and using a childhood friend to manipulate him -- were coercive and violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the confession was involuntary, it should not have been admitted into evidence in trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas argued that the interrogation was also unconstitutional because the police denied Spano access to his lawyer. He wrote that a defendant who has been charged with a crime is entitled to representation by counsel, and that right extends beyond the trial. Justice Hugo L. Black and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a concurrence in which he argued that the judgment should be reversed solely due to the fact that the defendant was denied access to counsel during his interrogation. Justice William O. Douglas and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28185,"name":"Herbert S.

Shelby requested the others’ assistance in carrying out plans to bomb certain Southern Bell facilities in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Abbate and Falcone did not go through with the plan and instead informed Chicago police when McLeod obtained dynamite and traveled to Mississippi. The State of Illinois subsequently charged all four with the crime of conspiring to destroy the property of another. Abbate and Falcone pled guilty and were sentenced to three months in prison each. Because several of the targeted facilities were used exclusively by the military and federal agencies, federal prosecutors subsequently charged Abbate, Falcone, and Shelby with conspiring to destroy property essential to the U.S. communications systems. At trial in federal district court, McLeod testified against his former co-conspirators, and the jury found them guilty. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgments against Abbate and Falcone on appeal. In their petition to the Supreme Court, Abbate and Falcone argued that the federal prosecution subsequent to their convictions under Illinois law violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which prevents someone from being tried more than once for the same crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibit federal prosecutions that are based on the same facts that underpin a defendant’s conviction under state law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to a federal prosecution that follows a state prosecution of the same person for the same actions. Rather, the separate prosecutions reflect the concurrent power of the state and federal governments to enforce their separate statutes. Moreover, the Court held that allowing the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar subsequent prosecutions by the other level of government would hinder the law enforcement capability of that entity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a separate opinion, Justice Brennan commented on the federal government’s argument in favor of affirming the convictions. He found the implications disturbing as the argument potentially allowed successive prosecutions of the same person by the same level of government. Justice Brennan reiterated that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects the notion that individuals should only have to spend money and time defending themselves once for a single crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent in which he argued that, under the Double Jeopardy Clause, Abbate and Falcone’s subsequent federal prosecution was just as troubling as Illinois imprisoning them twice for their role in the conspiracy. Expressing skepticism towards the concurrent powers theory relied on by the Court, Justice Black noted that foreign nations, unlike state and federal governments, are completely distinct sovereigns, yet many nations refuse to prosecute an individual following a prosecution in another country for the same acts. Additionally, the legislative history of the Double Jeopardy clause showed that language that would have restricted the clause to prohibit only successive prosecutions by the same government had been rejected. Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William O. Douglas concurred in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18382,"name":"Charles A.

Under the U.S. Constitution, imports are not taxed.  Youngstown took the ore needed for each day of manufacturing from the storage piles to stock bins.  The state of Ohio assessed property tax on the ore because Youngstown had changed the ore from an import to a manufacturing supply.  Youngstown argued that the ore kept in storage bins was not taxable because it was held for storage only.  Youngstown also argued that the tax violated equal protection because it applied to residents of Ohio, but not to non-residents who had property in the state.  After exhausting administrative proceedings, the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld the tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 44, Plywood Corp. imported lumber and veneers for manufacturing.  Plywood piled the lumber in a yard in Algoma, Wisconsin for storage and drying.  The City of Algoma taxed half of the stored supplies on the theory that at least that amount was destined for manufacturing.  Plywood paid the tax and sued for a refund.  The trial court and the Supreme Court of Wisconsin upheld the tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the manufacturers act on the imported supplies significantly enough to change their status from imports to taxable property?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 6-2 decision, Justice Charles E. Whittaker wrote the majority opinion affirming the lower courts.  The Supreme Court held that because the imported goods became supplies needed for manufacturing, the goods changed their status as imports.  It did not matter that the goods were stored away from other taxable property before us.  The court also deferred to the Supreme Court of Ohio and rejected Youngstown’s claim that the Ohio tax violated equal protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter wrote a partial dissent, agreeing with the majority about Youngstown, but disagreeing about Plywood.  He found that Plywood’s main purpose for storing the lumber was drying, so it remained an import.

All of the other states required one type or the other. Arguing that the Illinois law unduly burdened interstate commerce, Navajo Freight Lines, Inc. prevailed in the lower court, which issued an injunction preventing Bibb from enforcing the law. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid a law which required a specific type of rear mudguard on trucks and trailers operated on Illinois\u0027s state highways violate the Commerce Clause of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by William O. Douglas, the Court held that the Illinois requirement placed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. While writing that safety measures \"carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged,\" Justice Douglas nevertheless affirmed that if the effect of such measures are \"slight or problematical,\" then the interests of commerce should prevail. No clear benefits of using contoured mudguards could be identified, and they might even lead to additional hazards. Thus, the presumption of validity could be overcome. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Harlan and Stewart concurred. \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13647,"title":"Oral Argument - March 30, 1959","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13647"},{"id":13691,"title":"Oral Argument - March 31, 1959","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13691"}],"citation":{"volume":"359","page":"520","year":"1959","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24640"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.
