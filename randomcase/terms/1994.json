The Act defines take as \"harass, harm, pursue,\" \"wound,\" or \"kill.\" The Secretary of the Interior further characterizes \"harm\" as including \"significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife.\" Several persons within forestry industries sued the Secretary, asserting that Congress did not intend for the regulation to include changes in habitat. The District Court found for the Secretary of the Interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court of Appeals reversed on the basis of noscitur a sociis, which means that the meaning of words is determined by the words around it. Thus, \"harm\" could only include actions applying direct force to the animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the definition of \"harm\" as an expansion of the word \"take\" in the Endangered Species Act include habitat modification that kills or injures wildlife?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 decision written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Supreme Court held that habitat modification is a legitimate application of the word \"harm.\" First, the Court found that the Court of Appeals was incorrect in assuming that the words in the definition of \"take\" only apply to actions involving direct contact with endangered animals. Then, based on the Act itself, the Court determined that the ordinary meaning of harm would in fact include changes in habitat that hurt the endangered animals. Also, the Court held that the intent of the Act to give broad protection to endangered species must include even actions that may have minimal or unforeseeable effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

(Coors) applied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for an approval of proposed labels. The approval was rejected because it violated the Federal Alcohol Administration Act’s (FAAA) prohibition of disclosing the alcohol content on beer labels or advertisements. Coors filed a claim arguing the regulation violated the First Amendment’s protection of commercial speech. The government argued the regulation was necessary to prevent “strength wars” among brewers, which in this case, refers to breweries competing on the basis of the potency of their alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court found in favor of Coors, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the judgment and remanded the case back to the district court. The district court subsequently upheld the ban of alcohol content in advertising, but not on labels. The government appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the lower court by concluding that the label ban did not prevent strength wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Federal Alcohol Administration Act’s prohibition of displaying alcohol content on beer labels violate the First Amendment’s protection of commercial speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion for the 9-0 majority. The Court held that for the government to regulate commercial speech, the government must have a substantial interest that the regulation directly affects. In this case, the interest the government intended to protect by banning the display of alcohol content on beer labels was to limit the “strength wars” of competing beer companies, which could lead to greater alcoholism. However, the Court concluded that this interest was not substantial enough, since there was no reason to believe that banning the alcoholic content on beer labels would prevent such social harms. The regulation also does not directly advance the suppression of strength wars, especially since other provisions of the FAAA directly counteract its effects. Finally, the Court held the regulation was more extensive than necessary, since there were available and effective alternatives that would not violate the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens delivered a concurring opinion emphasizing the regulation is unconstitutionality of the regulation because it did not increase consumer awareness, but instead blinded the public to the truth of the alcohol content.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17601,"name":"Bruce J.

The Coast Guard Court of Military Review affirmed. On rehearing, the court rejected Ryder\u0027s claim that its composition violated the Appointments Clause because two of the judges on the three-judge panel were civilians appointed by the General Counsel of the Department of Transportation. The Court of Military Appeals agreed with Ryder that the appointments violated the Clause under its previous decision in United States v. Carpenter that appellate military judges are inferior officers who must be appointed by a President, a court of law, or a head of a department. The court nonetheless affirmed Ryder\u0027s conviction on the ground that the actions of the two civilian judges were valid de facto.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs it proper to accord de facto validity to the actions of civilian judges on a military appellate panel, when the accused challenges the composition of the panel as a violation of the Constitution\u0027s Appointments Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that the judges\u0027 actions were not valid de facto. The Court reasoned that a defendant who made a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case was entitled to a decision on the merits of the question and whatever relief may be appropriate if a violation had occurred.

The Supreme Court\u0027s ruling in \u003cem\u003eLampf v Gilbertson\u003c/em\u003e (1991) set a universal time limit of three years after an alleged violation for suits stemming from the relevant portion the Securities and Exchange Act. Based on this ruling, a district court judge dismissed the shareholders\u0027 case on August 13, 1991. On December 19, 1991, Congress enacted the FDIC Improvement Act, which required courts to reinstate cases dismissed under the Supreme Court\u0027s limitation in \u003cem\u003eLampf\u003c/em\u003e. The shareholders filed a motion to reinstate. A district court judge agreed the act required the case be reinstated, but denied the request on the ground that Congress had violated separation of powers in requiring the courts to reopen settled matters. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the lower court\u0027s conclusion on the same ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Congress violate separation of powers by requiring federal courts reopen settled cases as part of the FDIC Improvement Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 opinion authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court concluded that Congress had usurped power assigned to the judiciary by Article III and thus had violated the separation of powers principle. Justice Scalia notes that Article III assigns to the courts the \"judicial power of the United States\" and the power to \"say what the law is.\" According to the Court, this clearly includes \"the power to render final judgments,\" and by enacting what Justice Scalia describes as \"retroactive legislation, that is, legislation that prescribes what the law \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e at an earlier time,\" Congress intruded upon the power of the courts to issue \"the last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy.\" Thus, Congress had violated separation of powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43817,"name":"William H.

Afterwards, Rambo acquired new skills and obtained longshore work as a crane operator, earning more than three times his preinjury earnings, though his disabled physical condition remained unchanged. Metropolitan filed to modify Rambo\u0027s disability award under the LHWCA on the ground that there had been a change in conditions such that Rambo was no longer disabled. An Administrative Law judge terminated Rambo\u0027s benefits. The Benefits Review Board affirmed. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that the LHWCA authorizes modification only where there has been a change in an employee\u0027s physical condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u0027 Compensation Act allow a party to seek modification of a disability award on the ground of change in conditions, when there has been no change in the employee\u0027s physical condition but rather an increase in the employee\u0027s wage-earning capacity due to the acquisition of new skills?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that a disability award may be modified under the LHWCA where there is a change in the employee\u0027s wage-earning capacity, even without any change in the employee\u0027s physical condition. The Court reasoned that, because an interpretation of the term \"change in conditions\" to include not only changes in physical condition but also changes in other conditions relevant to the initial entitlement to benefits, such as a change in wage-earning capacity is consistent with the purpose of the LHWCA. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, arguing that the term refers to the physical condition of the person receiving compensation and should not be departed from absent any indication from Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38699,"name":"Robert E.

These PVPA certificates act like patents in order to promote research on new varieties of plants and to protect the owners of seed varieties from unauthorized sales. However, there is an exemption for farmers who sell seed to other farmers whose primary occupation is growing crops for sale. In 1990, Winterboer planted and harvested 265 acres of land with two Asgrow soybean varieties. He then sold enough to plant 10,000 acres to other farmers for use as seed. Asgrow claimed that the PVPA prohibits anyone from selling for seed more than would be needed to replant his own fields - an amount greatly exceeded by Winterboer\u0027s sales. Winterboer argued that the exemptions in the statute protect sales of unlimited amounts of seed as long as both seller and buyer grow crops primarily for \"other than reproductive purposes.\" The District Court ruled in favor of Asgrow, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and denied Asgrow\u0027s petition for rehearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the quantity of protected seed that a farmer can sell under the exemptions in the Plant Variety Protection Act limited to the amount of seed the seller would need to replant his own fields?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 decision authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that a farmer may sell for reproductive purposes only such seed as he has saved for the purpose of replanting his own fields. While the statute allows farmers to save seed to replant and then sell that saved seed to other farmers for planting, the statute prohibits growing protected seed as a \"step in marketing\" it as seed for planting. The Court held that because Winterboer\u0027s planting and harvesting were conducted solely to market (that is, to sell) Asgrow\u0027s protected seed varieties, he forfeited eligibility for the PVPA exemption and infringed on Asgrow\u0027s protective certificates.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43825,"name":"William H.

(MKI) immediately pay the entire MKI debt. When First Options\u0027 demands for payment went unsatisfied, it sought arbitration by a panel of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange based on workout agreements, which governed the working out of debts owned by Kaplan, his wife, and MKI. MKI, which had signed the only workout document containing an arbitration agreement, submitted to arbitration, but the Kaplans, who had not signed that document, filed objections with the panel. The Kaplans argued that their disagreement with First Options not was arbitrable. After deciding that they had the power to rule on the dispute\u0027s merits, the arbitrators ruled in First Options\u0027 favor. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals reversed the award, finding that the dispute was not arbitrable. The appellate court concluded that courts should independently decide whether an arbitration panel has jurisdiction over a dispute, and that it would apply ordinary standards of review when considering the District Court\u0027s denial of a motion to vacate the arbitration award.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the arbitrability of disputes subject to independent review by the courts? Should courts of appeals apply an \"abuse of discretion\" standard when reviewing district court upholding arbitration awards?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that the arbitrability of the Kaplan/First Options dispute was subject to independent review by the courts and that, rather than a special abuse of discretion standard, courts of appeals should apply ordinary standards when reviewing district court decisions upholding arbitration awards. \"We conclude that, because the Kaplans did not clearly agree to submit the question of arbitrability to arbitration, the Court of Appeals was correct in finding that the arbitrability of the Kaplan/First Options dispute was subject to independent review by the courts,\" wrote Justice Breyer for the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30891,"name":"James D.

According to the 1990 decennial census, Georgia\u0027s black population of 27% entitled blacks to an additional eleventh congressional seat, prompting Georgia\u0027s General Assembly to re-draw the state\u0027s congressional districts. After the Justice Department refused pre-clearance of several of the Assembly\u0027s proposed new districts, the Assembly was finally successful in creating an additional majority-black district through the forming of an eleventh district. This district, however, was called a \"geographic monstrosity\" because it extended 6,784.2 square miles from Atlanta to the Atlantic Ocean.

Gottesman shipped the videos, containing pornographic acts by industry legend Traci Lords before she turned eighteen, to Hawaii.

Specially, the participants alleged that American\u0027s imposition of capacity controls and blackout dates to mileage credits they had previously accumulated violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act and constituted a breach of contract. American responded that the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA) preempted the claim. The ADA prohibits States from \"enacting or enforcing any law...relating to [air carrier] rates, routes, or services.\" The Illinois Supreme Court ruled to allow the breach of contract and Consumer Fraud Act monetary relief claims to survive. After the U.S. Supreme Court\u0027s decision in Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, American petitioned for certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 preempt a state-court suit, brought by participants in an airline\u0027s frequent flyer program, challenging the airline\u0027s retroactive changes in terms and conditions of the program?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-2 opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that the ADA bars state-imposed regulation of air carriers, thus claims brought under a state\u0027s consumer fraud act are preempted; but that the ADA allows room for court enforcement of contract terms set by the parties themselves, which permits breach of contract claims to proceed. \"A remedy confined to a contract\u0027s terms simply holds parties to their agreements -- in this instance, to business judgments an airline made public about its rates and services,\" wrote Justice Ginsburg. Justice John Paul Stevens filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was joined by Justice Thomas Clarence. Justice Antonin Scalia took no part in the decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17601,"name":"Bruce J.

Under the terms of the federal contract, the prime contractor would receive additional compensation if it hired small businesses controlled by \"socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\" [The clause declared that \"the contractor shall presume that socially and economically disadvantaged individuals include Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities....\" Federal law requires such a subcontracting clause in most federal agency contracts]. Another subcontractor, Gonzales Construction Company, was awarded the work. It was certified as a minority business; Adarand was not. The prime contractor would have accepted Adarand\u0027s bid had it not been for the additional payment for hiring Gonzales.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the presumption of disadvantage based on race alone, and consequent allocation of favored treatment, a discriminatory practice that violates the equal protection principle embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Overruling Metro Broadcasting (497 US 547), the Court held that all racial classifications, whether imposed by federal, state, or local authorities, must pass strict scrutiny review. In other words, they \"must serve a compelling government interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.\" The Court added that compensation programs which are truly based on disadvantage, rather than race, would be evaluated under lower equal protection standards. However, since race is not a sufficient condition for a presumption of disadvantage and the award of favored treatment, all race-based classifications must be judged under the strict scrutiny standard. Moreover, even proof of past injury does not in itself establish the suffering of present or future injury. The Court remanded for a determination of whether the Transportation Department\u0027s program satisfied strict scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45882,"name":"William Perry Pendley","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_perry_pendley","view_count":0,"last_name":"Pendley","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"william_perry_pendley"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/16362"},{"advocate":{"ID":20740,"name":"Drew S.

The prohibition applies even when neither the subject of the speech or article nor the person or group paying for it has any connection with the employee\u0027s official duties. The National Treasury Employees Union filed suit challenging the honorarium ban as an unconstitutional abridgement of its freedom of speech.

The judge on the case authorized a wiretap of Tham and Chapman’s phones.  He kept these wiretaps secret. Chapman was distantly related to U.S. District Court Judge Robert P. Aguilar.  When Chapman asked Aguilar for help in the case, Aguilar talked to the judge on the case and learned about the wiretap.  Though the wiretap order had expired, Aguilar told Chapman about it.  When FBI agents questioned Aguilar on the matter, he lied about his knowledge and participation in the case.  Aguilar was tried and convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for disclosing a wiretap and endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of justice.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the convictions, holding that disclosing an expired wiretap does not violate the law, and Aguilar did not obstruct justice because the grand jury investigating the case did not order the FBI investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Can an individual who endeavors to obstruct a grand jury proceeding by making false and misleading statements to prospective witnesses be prosecuted for obstruction of justice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Can an individual who knows of a wiretap and discloses it to a target in order to obstruct the interception of the target\u0027s conversations be found guilty, regardless of whether the authorization had expired by the time the disclosure was made?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Yes.  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the court, affirming in part and reversing in part.  The Supreme Court held that making false statements to an FBI agent who may or may not testify at trial is not sufficient to support a conviction for obstruction of justice.  Aguilar’s conviction for disclosing a wiretap was proper, however, because the statute does not require that the wiretap is currently in force.  The First Amendment did not require excluding expired wiretaps from the statute either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing that Aguilar’s conviction for obstructing justice should be overturned, but arguing that the wiretapping conviction should be overturned as well.  There was no way Aguilar could interfere with a wiretap that no longer existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia also concurred in part and dissented in part, agreeing to affirm the disclosure of wiretapping conviction, but arguing that the obstruction of justice should be affirmed as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30335,"name":"James A.

Rosenberger, a University of Virginia student, asked the University for $5,800 from a student activities fund to subsidize the publishing costs of Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia. The University refused to provide funding for the publication solely because it \"primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,\" as prohibited by University guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the University of Virginia violate the First Amendment rights of its Christian magazine staff by denying them the same funding resources that it made available to secular student-run magazines?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court, in a 5-to-4 opinion, held that the University\u0027s denial of funding to Rosenberger, due to the content of his message, imposed a financial burden on his speech and amounted to viewpoint discrimination. The Court noted that no matter how scarce University publication funding may be, if it chooses to promote speech at all, it must promote all forms of it equally. Furthermore, because it promoted past publications regardless of their religious content, the Court found the University\u0027s publication policy to be neutral toward religion and, therefore, not in violation of the establishment clause. The Court concluded by stating that the University could not stop all funding of religious speech while continuing to fund an atheistic perspective. The exclusion of several views is as offensive to free speech as the exclusion of only one. The University must provide a financial subsidy to a student religious publication on the same basis as other student publications.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36378,"name":"Michael W.

The Council refused a place in the event for the Irish American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston (GLIB). The group attempted to join to express its members\u0027 pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals. The Massachusetts State Court ordered the Veterans\u0027 Council to include GLIB under a state law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation in public accommodations. The Veterans\u0027 Council claimed that forced inclusion of GLIB members in their privately-organized parade violated their free speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid a Massachusetts State Court\u0027s mandate to Boston\u0027s Veterans\u0027 Council, requiring it to include GLIB members in its parade, violate the Council\u0027s free speech rights as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. A unanimous court held that the State Court\u0027s ruling to require private citizens who organize a parade to include a group expressing a message that the organizers do not wish to convey violates the First Amendment by making private speech subordinate to the public accommodation requirement.

The officers opened the unlocked screen door and walked in, identified themselves as police officers, and said that they had a warrant. Ms. Wilson\u0027s attorney filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search, claiming it was invalid on the grounds that the officers had failed to \"knock and announce\" before entering.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment\u0027s reasonable search and seizure clause require police officers to knock and announce their presence before entering a private residence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.

To that end, Great Lakes used a crane to drive piles into the riverbed, which potentially weakened the structure of the freight tunnel that ran below the river. On April 13, 1992, water from the Chicago River poured into a freight tunnel, which subsequently flooded into the basements of several buildings. After the flood, many victims sued Great Lakes in state court and argued that the flood was the result of the weakening of the tunnel. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock removed the case to federal district court and argued federal admiralty court had jurisdiction of marine cases. The district court dismissed the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a federal district court have federal admiralty jurisdiction to determine and limit the extent of the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company’s tort liability?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice David Souter delivered the opinion of the 7-0 majority. The Court held the federal district court has admiralty jurisdiction to determine and limit the extent of the Great Lakes’ tort of liability. Admiralty jurisdiction is appropriate when a party can prove either that the tort occurred on navigable water or that the injury on land was caused by actions on navigable water. In this case, this condition is satisfied since the alleged tort was committed on navigable water, and it is not necessary to prove that the subsequent damage was close in time and space. Great Lakes proved the connection with maritime activity by showing how the damage caused by a vessel on navigable water to an underwater structure is potentially disruptive to maritime commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17461,"name":"Ben Barnow","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/ben_barnow","view_count":0,"last_name":"Barnow","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"ben_barnow"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner Jerome B.

The termite prevention contract specified that any controversy would be settled exclusively by arbitration. After the Gwins sold their house and transferred their plan to the Dobsons, the Dobsons initiated suit against the Gwins, Allied-Bruce, and Terminix following a termite infestation. Allied- Bruce and Terminix asked for, but were denied, a stay to allow for arbitration under the contract and the Federal Arbitration Act. In affirming, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld the denial of the stay on the basis of a state statute making written, predispute arbitration agreements invalid and unenforceable. The court also found that the Federal Arbitration Act did not apply because the parties entering the contract contemplated transactions that were primarily local and not substantially interstate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the Federal Arbitration Act, making an arbitration provision enforceable in contracts \"evidencing a transaction involving commerce,\" be applied broadly?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act applied to all disputes involving commerce, and thus the arbitration clause was valid and enforceable. The Court reasoned that the word \"involving\" in section 2 of the Act signaled an intent to exercise Congress\u0027 commerce clause power to the full and that section 2 is to be read requiring only that the \"transaction\" in fact \"involve\" interstate commerce, even if the parties did not contemplate an interstate commerce connection. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor filed a concurring opinion. Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas filed dissenting opinions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15669,"name":"Allan R.

The next day, the state charges were dismissed after federal agents charged Lopez with violating a federal criminal statute, the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. The act forbids \"any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that [he] knows...is a school zone.\" Lopez was found guilty following a bench trial and sentenced to six months\u0027 imprisonment and two years\u0027 supervised release.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the 1990 Gun-Free School Zones Act, forbidding individuals from knowingly carrying a gun in a school zone, unconstitutional because it exceeds the power of Congress to legislate under the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.

Sargent directed Evans to pull over and asked to see his license. Evans informed Sargent that his license was suspended, and upon running the license, Sargent found that there was also an outstanding warrant for Evans’ arrest. During the arrest, Evans dropped a hand-rolled cigarette that smelled of marijuana, so officers searched his car and discovered a bag of marijuana. When Evans was charged with possession of marijuana, the police were informed that his arrest warrant had been quashed and only remained on the record due to a clerical error. Evans moved to exclude the marijuana evidence because it was discovered during the course of an illegal arrest. The trial court granted the motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arizona Court of Appeals reversed and held that the exclusionary rule was not intended to deter government employees who were not directly associated with the arrest. The Arizona Supreme Court reversed and held there was no meaningful distinction between clerical errors committed by law enforcement personnel and those committed by court employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the exclusionary rule prohibit the introduction of the evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment on the basis of an erroneous police record?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review cases from state courts that deal primarily with federal law. The Court also held that the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect against intrusions into a home or onto private property, or the conduct of police officers. The exclusionary rule therefore does not apply to the conduct of judicial officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote a concurring opinion where she argued that the majority’s decision does not allow any evidence that is the result of a clerical error. Rather, the police must rely on accurate record-keeping systems in order to admit evidence found based on the information in those records. Justice David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer joined in the concurrence. In his concurrence, Justice Souter wrote that the majority’s opinion should be read as dealing solely with the issue of this type of clerical error, and not as dealing with the concept of how deterrence by exclusion extends to the government as a whole. Justice Breyer joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent and argued that the Fourth Amendment was meant as a constraint on governmental power as a whole, and not merely on its agents, namely the police. He also argued that the exclusionary rule does not place the government at a disadvantage in trial; the government is merely in the position it would be if it had not conducted the illegal search at all. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed because the Arizona Supreme Court ruled on the issue based on its constitutional analysis, rather than federal law, so the U.S. Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction. She also argued that the exclusionary rule should apply to judicial clerical errors because such errors become magnified and can hugely impact an innocent citizens life. Justice Stevens joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18592,"name":"Carol A.

Oxford House asserted that under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), which prohibits discrimination in housing against persons with handicaps, the city had failed to make reasonable accommodations permitting the maintenance of the group home in a single-family zone. Edmonds sought a declaration that the FHA did not apply to the city\u0027s zoning code. The District Court held that the city\u0027s zoning code rule defining family was exempt from the FHA under as a reasonable restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. The Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the City of Edmonds\u0027 zoning code provision covering areas zoned for single-family dwelling units -- which defines family as persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer unrelated persons -- qualify for exemption from the Fair Housing Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that Edmonds\u0027 zoning code definition of the term \"family\" is not a maximum occupancy restriction exempt from the FHA. Noting that it was designed to foster the family character of a neighborhood, Justice Ginsburg reasoned that the provision was a family composition rule and was not a maximum occupancy restriction exempt from FHA scrutiny because, while it capped the number of unrelated persons allowed to occupy a single-family dwelling at five, it did not cap the total number of people permitted to live in such a dwelling. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.

Tome and the child’s mother were divorced and Tome had primary physical custody of the child, but the mother was awarded custody in 1990. The prosecution argued that the sexual abuse occurred while the child was with Tome, but was not discovered until the child spent vacation time with her mother. Tome argued that the allegations were fabricated to keep the child from being returned to him. The prosecution produced six witnesses who testified to verify the out of court statements made by the child. The out of court statements were all made after the motive to fabricate would have arisen. The district court admitted the statements into evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B), which state that prior statements of a witness are not hearsay is they are consistent with the witness’ testimony and are offered to rebut a charge of “recent fabrication or improper influence of motive.” Tome was convicted. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit affirmed, holding that the proper test was to weigh the probative value against their prejudicial effect, not whether statements were made before or after the motive to fabricate arose.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a prior consistent statement made after a declarant\u0027s motive to fabricate arose admissible to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed and remanded. The Supreme Court held that, consistent with common law, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) requires that prior consistent statements be made before the motive to fabricate arose in order to be admissible. While hearsay evidence is often relevant, relevance is not the only criterion for determining admissibility. The Court held that the 10th Circuit’s balancing approach involved too much judicial discretion, reduced predictability, and enhanced difficulties of trial preparation. The Court also noted that the Advisory Committee Notes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure confirm their analysis. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in part and concurred in the judgment, writing that the Advisory Committee Notes should have no authoritative effect and the case could be resolved without resorting to the Notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stephen G. Breyer dissented, arguing that the basic issue in the case was relevance, not hearsay. Rule 801(d)(1)(B) does not codify the common law, and it permits the district court to allow prior consistent statements made at any time when they are probative. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, and Justice Clarence Thomas joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30517,"name":"Joseph W.

School officials were concerned that drug use increases the risk of sports-related injury. Consequently, the Vernonia School District of Oregon adopted the Student Athlete Drug Policy which authorizes random urinalysis drug testing of its student athletes. James Acton, a student, was denied participation in his school\u0027s football program when he and his parents refused to consent to the testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes random drug testing of high school athletes violate the reasonable search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The reasonableness of a search is judged by \"balancing the intrusion on the individual\u0027s Fourth Amendment interests against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\" In the case of high school athletes who are under State supervision during school hours, they are subject to greater control than over free adults. The privacy interests compromised by urine samples are negligible since the conditions of collection are similar to public restrooms, and the results are viewed only by limited authorities. Furthermore, the governmental concern over the safety of minors under their supervision overrides the minimal, if any, intrusion in student-athletes\u0027 privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42496,"name":"Thomas M.

That evening and the following morning, Margaret suffered seizures that were a symptom of encephalopathy. Her parents filed a claim on her behalf and alleged that the vaccine caused her encephalopathy, a condition that impairs brain function. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to prove their claim under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, claimants must meet the requirements of the Vaccine Injury Table, which lists the conditions associated with each vaccine and the timeframe of their expected occurrence. The Special Master, empowered to hear such claims, determined that Margaret’s symptoms indicated encephalopathy, but that she exhibited symptoms of the condition prior to the vaccination, and therefore her symptoms did not fit within the timetable. The Master denied compensation and the Court of Federal Claims affirmed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust a claimant seeking compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act show that the first symptom of an injury began after receiving the vaccination?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice David H. Souter delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that a claimant must show that the symptoms did not exist prior to the administration of the vaccine. The Act specifically states that the first symptom must occur within the timeframe set by the table in order for the claim to be valid. If the first symptom occurs before the vaccination, any further symptoms do not fulfill the requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her concurring opinion, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote that the Court’s ruling properly held the claims allowed by the Act to a high standard of proof, which adhered to the purpose of the Act. She also emphasized that the decision of the Court solely dealt with defining the burden of the claimant, and did not address any subsequent factual challenges on the part of the Whitecottons against the decision of the Special Master. Justice Stephen G. Breyer joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39966,"name":"Robert Thomas Moxley","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/robert_thomas_moxley","view_count":0,"last_name":"Moxley","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"robert_thomas_moxley"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/16469"},{"advocate":{"ID":28554,"name":"Irving L.

The city denied fault and filed a counterclaim for damage to its dock, alleging that National Gypsum was negligent in leaving the ship virtually unmanned. The District Court found that both parties were negligent, apportioned liability primarily to National Gypsum, and entered a partial judgment for the stipulated amount of National Gypsum\u0027s damages, excluding prejudgment interest. The court held that the fact that National Gypsum\u0027s loss was primarily attributable to its own negligence and the existence of a genuine dispute over the City\u0027s liability were special circumstances justifying a departure from the general rule that prejudgment interest should be awarded in maritime collision cases. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that mutual fault cannot provide a basis for denying prejudgment interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the fact that a plaintiff\u0027s loss was primarily attributable to its own negligence, together with the existence of a genuine dispute over liability, justify a District Court\u0027s departure from the general rule that prejudgment interest should be awarded in maritime collision cases?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-0 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that neither a good-faith dispute over liability nor the existence of mutual fault justifies the denial of prejudgment interest in an admiralty collision case. In calculating the amount of the loss for which the relatively innocent party is responsible, the Court found that a denial of prejudgment interest on the basis of mutual fault would unfairly penalize a party twice for the same mistake. \"The existence of a legitimate difference of opinion on the issue of liability is merely a characteristic of most ordinary lawsuits. It is not an extraordinary circumstance that can justify denying prejudgment interest,\" wrote Justice Stevens. Justice Stephen G. Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28184,"name":"Harney B.

More than three years later, Carol Hyde, a passenger in the car, sued the truck driver and his employer for negligence in the Court of Common Pleas. Ohio had a two-year statute of limitations for such actions, but because the truck driver and his employer were from out of state, a special provision tolled the running of the statute of limitations. 10 months after this suit began, the Supreme Court decided in \u003cem\u003eBendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc.\u003c/em\u003e, 486 U.S. 888 (1988) that the tolling provision placed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The Court of Common Pleas applied \u003cem\u003eBendix\u003c/em\u003e and dismissed Hyde\u0027s suit as untimely. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, but the Ohio Supreme Court reversed on the ground that \u003cem\u003eBendix\u003c/em\u003e could not be retroactively applied to claims that commenced prior to that decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan Ohio apply its unconstitutional tolling provision to claims that accrued prior to \u003cem\u003eBendix\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision, Justice Stephan G. Breyer wrote for the majority, holding that the \u003cem\u003eBendix\u003c/em\u003e rule must be retroactively applied. Hyde conceded that the Supreme Court had already decided in \u003cem\u003eHarper v Virginia Dept. of Taxation\u003c/em\u003e, 509 U.S. 86 (1993) that when the court applies a new legal rule courts must treat the new rule as retroactive. The Court rejected Hyde\u0027s claim that applying the rule would unfairly deny her a remedy. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote a special concurrence stating that \u003cem\u003eBendix\u003c/em\u003e did not announce a new rule and merely applied existing precedent. Following this reasoning, the discussion of retroactivity was unnecessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45948,"name":"William E.

The officers arrested Jones because he appeared drunk. Later, Jones found himself with several broken ribs. Jones brought a constitutional tort action against the officers, claiming that they used excessive force when they arrested him and that they beat him at the police station. As government officials, the officers were entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense. Three of the officers moved for summary judgment arguing that he could point to no evidence that these three had beaten him or had been present during beatings. Holding that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence supporting Jones\u0027s theory of the case, the District Court denied the motion. The officers sought an immediate appeal, arguing that the denial was wrong because the evidence in the pretrial record was not sufficient to show a genuine issue of fact for trial. The Court of Appeals held that it lacked appellate jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a Federal District Court\u0027s determination, in denying a summary judgment motion of police officers entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense, that the record raised a factual issue an appealable final decision?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that a defendant, who is entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a District Court\u0027s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial. The Court reasoned, in part, that the competing considerations underlying questions of finality, including the inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review, the danger of denying justice by delay, the comparative expertise of trial and appellate courts, and the wise use of appellate resources, argue against allowing immediate appeals of orders of the kind in question and in favor of limiting interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity matters to cases presenting more abstract issues of law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19917,"name":"Charles A.

After an initial trial with a hung jury, Kyles was tried again, convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to death.  The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the decision on direct appeal.  Then Kyles sought state collateral review, where he was unsuccessful, but he uncovered evidence favorable to him that the prosecution failed to disclose before or during trial.  Kyles filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court, citing \u003ci\u003eBrady v. Maryland\u003c/i\u003e, which held that the prosecution violates due process if they fail to disclose material evidence that is favorable to a criminal defendant.  The district court denied relief, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Would the prosecution’s production of evidence favorable to Kyles have resulted in acquittal or mistrial?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Would the prosecution’s production of evidence favorable to Kyles have created sufficient doubt in the mind of at least one juror to result in a life sentence rather than the death penalty?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eMaybe, maybe.  Justice David H. Souter, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed the Fifth Circuit.  The Supreme Court held that Kyles was entitled to a new trial because the net effect of the suppressed evidence raised a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different result.  The Fifth Circuit used the wrong standard and failed to consider the cumulative effect of all the evidence that the prosecution failed to disclose.  Justice John Paul Stevens concurred, supporting the decision to grant certiorari and review the case on the merits.  Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia dissented, arguing that the case should be dismissed as improvidently granted.  The suppressed evidence did not create a reasonable probability that the jury would reach a different result given the large amount of negative evidence the prosecution presented.  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Justice Anthony M.

After a verdict was entered against the Hill Group, the underwriters sought a federal declaratory judgment that their policies did not cover the Hill Group\u0027s liability. The Hill Group filed a state court suit and moved to dismiss or to stay the underwriter\u0027s action. The District Court entered a stay on the ground that the state suit encompassed the same coverage issues raised in the federal action. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Noting that a district court has broad discretion to grant or decline to grant declaratory judgment, the appellate court did not require application of the exceptional circumstances test. The appellate court also reviewed the District Court\u0027s decision for abuse of discretion and found none.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the exceptional circumstances test govern a district court\u0027s decision to stay a declaratory judgment action during the pendency of parallel state court proceedings? Should a court of appeals evaluate a district court\u0027s decision to do so under an abuse of discretion standard of review?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and yes. In a 8-0 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that the discretionary standard of Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of America, 316 U.S. 491, governs a district court\u0027s decision to stay a declaratory judgment action during the pendency of parallel state court proceedings and that a district courts\u0027 decisions about the propriety of hearing declaratory judgment actions should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. The Court also concluded that the District Court acted within its bounds in staying the declaratory relief action in this case, since parallel proceedings, presenting an opportunity for the ventilation of the same state law issues, were underway in state court.

Gardner was treated in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility. Afterwards, he experienced weakness in his left leg, allegedly a result of the surgery. He claimed disability benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151, which requires the VA to pay disability compensation if an injury occurs as a result of or is worsened by treatment. The VA and the Board of Veterans Appeals denied the claim, stating that the statute, as interpreted by VA regulation 38 CFR 3.358 (c)(3), requires that the claimant prove that the injury arose due to negligence or error by the VA facility. The Court of Veterans Appeals reversed the decision on the ground that the fault-or-accident requirement in 38 CFR 3.358 was not warranted by Section 1151. The decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Department of Veterans Affairs regulation 38 CFR 3.358 (c)(3), which restricts disability compensation to injuries caused by accidents or negligence during surgery, consistent with the controlling statute, 38 U.S.C. 1151?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision authored by Justice David Souter, the Court affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision and ruled for Gardner. The Court held that Section 1151 contains no language requiring proof of fault, and it rejected the Government\u0027s claims that the requirement was implicit in the language of the statute. The Court acknowledged the 60-year longevity of the regulation and the post-1934 legislative silence on the issue, but neither concern could overcome the plain language of Section 1151.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30820,"name":"Joseph M.

In 94-835, the United Steelworkers of America filed a WARN claim, charging Crown Cork \u0026amp; Seal Co., Inc. with laying off 85 employees without giving the required 60-day notice. In rejecting Crown Cork\u0027s contention that the statute of limitations had run, the District Court held that the source of the limitations period for WARN suits is state law and that the union\u0027s suit was timely under any of the arguably applicable Pennsylvania statutes. In 94-834, another District Court granted summary judgment for North Star Steel Company, holding the nonunion employees\u0027 suit barred under a limitations period borrowed from the National Labor Relations Act, which the court believed was more analogous to WARN than any state law. The Court of Appeals consolidated the cases and held that a WARN limitations period should be borrowed from state, not federal, law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs state law the proper source of the limitations period for civil actions brought to enforce the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 9-0 opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that State law is the proper source of the limitations period for civil actions brought to enforce WARN. Where a federal statute fails to provide any limitations period for a new cause of action, the Court noted that its longstanding practice has been to borrow the limitations period from the most closely analogous state statute. The Court reasoned that North Star did not fall within the exception where the relevant state limitations periods would frustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies or be at odds with the purpose or operation of federal substantive law. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36722,"name":"Malcolm L.
