The daughter of an FMC employee, Gerald Holliday (Holliday), was seriously injured in a car accident and the Plan paid for a portion of her medical expenses. Holliday also received, in settlement of a negligence action he brought on behalf of his daughter, payment from the driver of the automobile in which his daughter was injured. FMC sought reimbursement under the terms of the Plan. Holliday obtained a declaratory judgment that Section 1720 of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law - which precludes reimbursement from a claimant\u0027s tort recovery for benefit payments by a program, group contract, or other arrangement - prohibited FMC\u0027s exercise of subrogation rights. The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which applies to employee welfare benefit plans such as FMC\u0027s Plan, did not preempt Section 1720.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes ERISA preempt the Pennsylvania law precluding employee welfare benefit plans from exercising subrogation rights on a claimant\u0027s tort recovery?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Three provisions of ERISA speak to the question of preemption: the preemption clause, the saving clause, and the deemer clause. The preemption clause establishes as an area of exclusive federal concern the subject of every state law that \"relate[s] to\" an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA. The saving clause returns to the states the power to enforce those state laws that \"regulat[e] insurance.\" The deemer clause dictates that an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA shall not be deemed an insurance matter. The Pennsylvania law is covered by the preemption clause since it relates to an employee benefit plan. It also falls within the saving clause because it invalidates certain insurance subrogation provisions. The deemer clause, however, exempts self-funded ERISA plans from being governed by state laws regulating insurance within the meaning of the saving clause. As a result, Section 1720 is preempted insofar as it prohibits FMC\u0027s self funded Plan from exercising its subrogation rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19917,"name":"Charles A.

After takeoff, one of the plane’s jet engines lost pressure. The flight crew shut down the failing engine and turned the plan around to return to Miami. The flight crew informed the passengers that the plane would be ditched in the Atlantic Ocean, but the crew managed to restart the engine and land the plane safely at Miami International Airport. A group of passengers, including Rose Marie Floyd, sued Eastern Airlines for mental distress caused by the incident. Eastern Airlines argued the engine failure and preparations for ditching the plane amounted to an accident under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention and also that Article 17 requires physical injury a condition of liability. The district court concluded than mental distress alone is not enough to receive compensation under Article 17. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and held the language in Article 17 encompasses purely emotional distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, which states that an international air carrier may be held liable for injuries of a passenger, allow recovery for mental or psychic injuries unaccompanied or manifested by physical injury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Thurgood Marshall deliver the unanimous opinion of the Court, which held that Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention does not allow recovery for purely mental injuries. The translation of the direct language of the Convention can only be interpreted as “bodily injury,” which is consistent with the negotiating history of the Convention.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30150,"name":"Joel D.

In order to sue the federal government for unlawful discrimination, one must obtain a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC (which is a waiver of the government\u0027s sovereign immunity from private suits). The EEOC mailed right-to-sue letters to both Irwin and his attorney. His attorney was out of the country, however, so while the letter arrived at his office on March 23, the attorney did not receive it until April 10. Irwin receive his copy of the letter on April 7. Less than a month from when Irwin received the letter, but more than a month from when the letter arrived at his attorney\u0027s office, Irwin filed suit in federal District Court. The court dismissed the suit, however, because it was filed more than a month after the attorney\u0027s office received the letter. Under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(c), suits against the government must be filed within 30 days \"of receipt of notice of final action taken\" by the EEOC. The court ruled that the 30-day window began when the attorney\u0027s office received the letter. On appeal, Irwin argued that the window should have started when he or his attorney - not just the attorney\u0027s office - actually received the letter. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument, however, upholding the District Court\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the 30-day window after \"receipt of notice of final action taken\" by the EEOC within which a suit against the federal government must be filed begin when an attorney\u0027s office receives notification, or when the attorney or client himself receives notification?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe 30-day window begins as soon as either the attorney\u0027s office, the attorney, or the client receives notification - whichever comes first. In an opinion written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Supreme Court held that lower courts have consistently held that notice to an attorney\u0027s office qualifies as notice to the client. \"The practical effect of a contrary rule would be to encourage factual disputes about when actual notice was received, and thereby create uncertainty in an area of the law where certainty is much to be desired,\" wrote Chief Justice Rehnquist.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31283,"name":"Jon T.

As they approached a group of youths near Foothill Blvd. and 63rd Ave., the youths panicked and ran.  One of the officers left the car and ran after Hodari D.  Hodari tossed away something that looked like a small rock just before the officer tackled him and handcuffed him.  The officer retrieved the rock, which turned out to be crack cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Hodari moved to suppress evidence relating to the cocaine, arguing that the officer obtained it during an unlawful search and seizure.  The trial court denied the motion.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that Hodari was “seized” when he saw the officer running towards him and that seizure was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  The California Supreme Court denied the state’s application for review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Has a person who is not under the physical control of a police officer been \"seized\" under the Fourth Amendment when the officer is chasing that person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Can a person who is pursued by a police officer avoid prosecution by discarding incriminating evidence and asserting that he did so out of fear of an unlawful search?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. No.  Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for a 7-2 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that a Fourth Amendment seizure requires some sort of physical force with lawful authority, or submission to an assertion of authority.  Hodari had not been touched when he discarded the cocaine, and had not submitted to authority because he was still attempting to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented, writing that a seizure takes place when a police officer conveys the message that a citizen is not free to leave.  In this situation, when the officer started chasing Hodari, he made it clear that Hodari was not free to leave.  Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40076,"name":"Ronald E.

Harmelin challenged his sentence as cruel and unusual, claiming it was disproportionate to the crime he committed and was statutorily mandated without consideration for the fact that he had no prior felony convictions. On appeal from an affirmance by the Michigan Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a statutorily mandated sentence that does not allow for consideration of mitigating factors a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u0027s protection against cruel and unusual punishments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, held that since the Eighth Amendment does not contain a proportionality guarantee, the determination of whether a punishment is \"cruel and unusual\" is not made with reference to the particular offense. Moreover, the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause protects against unusual methods of punishment, not necessarily cruel ones. As such, while Harmelin\u0027s life sentence may have been cruel, it was not constitutionally unusual or unprecedented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40651,"name":"Richard Thompson","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/richard_thompson","view_count":0,"last_name":"Thompson","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"richard_thompson"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15248"},{"advocate":{"ID":19322,"name":"Carla J.

Wilson sought financial awards and an injunction against the prison under 42 U.S.C. 1983. He filed suit in a federal district court against two state prison officials, Richard P. Seiter and Carl Humphreys. The District Court ruled against Wilson, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. It held that Wilson had to show that the prison officials had a \"culpable state of mind\" when inflicting harm upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit err by holding that prison officials must have a \"culpable state of mind\" in order to establish cruel and unusual punishment of an inmate? Did the Court of Appeals err by overlooking an inmate\u0027s claim that prison officials showed \"deliberate indifference\" to his conditions of confinement?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and Yes. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. The Court referred to its earlier decisions in \u003cem\u003eFrancis v. Resweber\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEstelle v. Gamble\u003c/em\u003e to establish that cruel and unusual punishment required the \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" For this to occur, the prison officials had to exhibit intentional cruelty, which would result in a \"culpable state of mind.\" However, \"deliberate indifference\" to a prisoner\u0027s conditions also constituted abusive treatment according to this standard.

The First Supreme Court District elected 2 judges, and the 5 other districts elected 1 judge each. The Orleans Parish was 1 of 4 parishes in the First Supreme Court District and the majority of its registered voters were black. However, more than 75% of the other 3 parishes\u0027 registered voters were white. Ronald Chisom and the other petitioners in this case, representing New Orleans\u0027s black majority, filed an action in the District Court against Louisiana\u0027s governor, Charles E. Roemer, and state officials, arguing that the state\u0027s justice election procedure weakened the minority\u0027s voting power, allegedly violating section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The 1982 amendment to this act prohibited any voting procedure which caused minority voters to \"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\" The District Court ruled against the petitioners. When the Court of Appeals evaluated the case, it sent the case back to the District Court with instructions to maintain the original ruling based partly on its claim that the 1982 amendment to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act did not apply to the election of judges. The District Court maintained their original opinion, but the petitioners and the United States appealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the 1982 amendment to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act apply to judicial elections?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a majority decision authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court rejected the possibility that Congress had intended for the 1982 amendment to exclude judicial elections. The Court determined that if Congress had that aim, it would have indicated this exclusion explicitly. Consequently, the Court favored a broad interpretation of the word \"representative\" in section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, considering it to encompass all winners of popular elections. Thus, the Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals, sending the original case back to be reevaluated in light of the reversal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38065,"name":"Pamela S.

However, he had a public defender represent him at a pretrial hearing at a county court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the hearing, sheriffs asked him about his involvement in a unrelated set of crimes, including murder. The sheriffs informed McNeil of his Miranda rights again, but he signed a waiver authorizing his testimony. His answers incriminated him for the crimes and he was charged in a state trial court. He unsuccessfully petitioned the court to invalidate his testimony as evidence. A jury convicted him and sentenced him to 60 years in prison. He contended that having the public defender represent him invoked his Miranda rights, which were later violated. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the accused\u0027s invocation of the Sixth Amendment\u0027s provision of legal counsel for one charge also invoke the Fifth Amendment\u0027s right to counsel for unrelated offenses charged later?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion for a 6-3 court. The Sixth Amendment ensures competent legal representation in courts of law, whereas the Fifth Amendment ensures adequate counsel when confronting police. Because the Amendments have different purposes, invoking the Sixth Amendment by retaining a public defender does not invoke the Fifth Amendment when speaking with the police about an unrelated criminal charge. The Court reasoned that \"[o]ne might be quite willing to speak to the police without counsel present concerning many matters, but not the matter under prosecution.\" McNeil\u0027s decision to have a public defender represent him at a pretrial hearing for armed robbery could not possibly indicate the choices he wished to make in the future regarding other confrontations with police.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25622,"name":"Gary M.

In 1977, the district court withdrew its enforcement of the plan, declaring that the Board had complied with the plan and reached \"unitary\" racial composition. In 1984, the Board passed the Student Reassignment Plan (SRP), which lessened busing in an effort to reduce travel time for black students. The group that originally protested segregation sought to restore the court-ordered desegregation, claiming that the school system again became segregated. The district court declined, but on appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the injunction was never formally removed. On reconsideration, the district court again declined to restore the injunction because it found the original \"Finger Plan\" unworkable. The Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIf a federal court deems that an injunction to desegregate schools has achieved its goals, can that court permanently dissolve the injunction?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the opinion for a 5-3 court. The Court held that the \"federal supervision of local school systems [has always] been intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimination.\" Once a school system demonstrates earnest compliance with an injunction, the federal court can consider removing it. The district court\u0027s finding in 1977 that the plan had achieved its goal of racially \"unitary\" schools was not sufficiently clear to dissolve the 1972 injunction. Instead, the district court could remove the injunction upon finding that \"that the school system was being operated in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause, and that it was unlikely that the Board would return to its former ways.\" If the Board satisfied these goals, the district court could remove the injunction and consider the SRP separately and on its own merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39089,"name":"Ronald L.

Cable companies and others filed suit in the State Chancery Court, alleging that taxing cable services, but not print and satellite broadcast services, violated their First Amendment expressive rights and 14th Amendment equal protection rights. In 1989, after the Chancery Court upheld the amendment, Arkansas again amended the GRA, extending the tax to satellite broadcast services. On appeal, the State Supreme Court upheld the GRA. However, the court ruled that the First Amendment prohibits differential taxation among members of the same medium. Therefore, because cable and scrambled satellite television services are essentially the same, the tax was unconstitutional when it applied only to cable services.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes differential taxation of different media violate the First and 14th Amendments? Does differential taxation of members of the same medium violate the First and 14th Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In an opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held 7-2 that without the intent or effect of suppressing expression, the First Amendment allows differential taxation of different media and differential taxation of some members of the same medium. Specifically, the Court held that the GRA was a generally applicable sales tax, and that its burden on cable television, while exempting the print media, was content-neutral, not directed at a select few, and not intended to interfere with expression. The Court went on to rule that the First Amendment allows a differential tax burden on some members of pay television services (that is, a tax on cable but not satellite services), if the tax is not intended to suppress expression. The Court ordered the State Supreme Court to address the 14th Amendment claim on remand. Dissenting, Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, argued that the First Amendment non-discrimination principle prohibits a heavier tax burden on one medium and not other media.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45206,"name":"William E.

The mortgages were worth substantially less at the time they were exchanged than they had been at the time they were acquired, however, and Centennial reported the difference as lost income on its income tax return. In a separate set of transactions, Centennial collected early withdrawal penalties from customers who withdrew their certificates of deposit before they were scheduled. Centennial reported the early withdrawal penalties as \"income from the discharge ... of indebtedness,\" meaning that it did not need to be reported as income under 26 U.S.C. 108(a)(1)(C).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to the exchanged mortgages, the IRS did not allow the deduction, ruling that the properties exchanged had not been \"materially different\" and that the exchange therefore did not actually produce a reportable loss. With regard to the withdrawal penalties, the IRS ruled that they had to be reported as income. Centennial took the issue to federal District Court, where a judge ruled for the IRS on the mortgage exchange issue but for Centennial on the withdrawal penalty one. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the mortgage exchange holding and upheld the withdrawal penalty holding, siding with Centennial on both issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a bank list the exchange of properties that have equal fair market value as a loss on its federal Income Tax return if the property it loses is worth significantly less at the time of the exchange than it was when the property was initially acquired? May a bank treat money received from early withdrawal penalties as \"income from the discharge ... of indebtedness\" under 26 U.S.C. 108(a)(1)(C)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. On the exchanged mortgage question, the Supreme Court referred to a companion case, \u003cem\u003eCottage Savings Association v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u003c/em\u003e, 499 U.S. 554, decided at the same time, in holding that the mortgages exchanged were \"materially different\" and could therefore be deducted as losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the question of early withdrawal penalties, however, the Court sided with the IRS. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the majority, stated that income comes from the \"discharge ... of indebtedness\" only when it is the result of the forgiveness of an obligation to repay assumed by the debtor (in this case the bank) at the outset of the debtor-creditor relationship. Because the early withdrawal fee was stipulated in the contract agreed upon at the outset of the certificate of deposit agreements, its payment was not the forgiveness of any obligation on behalf of the bank but rather the fulfillment of an obligation on behalf of the creditor. The bank was therefore required to list the penalties as income.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35734,"name":"Michael F.

To satisfy a judgment for the plaintiff, the court may order the vessel sold at public auction. Such an action is permitted those who go unpaid after furnishing a vessel with supplies essential for her continued voyaging. But maritime law long distinguished the contracts of middlemen, that is, agents or brokers procuring supplies for a vessel from other sources. Such intermediary contracts were considered ordinary agency agreements, and therefore outside admiralty jurisdiction. The Supreme Court embraced this distinction in \u003cem\u003eMinturn v. Minyard, \u003c/em\u003e 58 U.S. (17 How.) 477 (1854).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, EXXON sued a cargo ship, the \u003cem\u003eWilliam Hopper, in rem\u003c/em\u003e and her owner, Central Gulf Lines, \u003cem\u003ein personam\u003c/em\u003e for the price of fuel delivered to the ship in the ports of New York and Jeddah. Exxon had a contract with Waterman Steamship Company to supply fuel for its fleet anywhere in the world. Sometimes EXXON furnished its own fuels; otherwise, EXXON procured fuels from other sellers. Among the vessels operated by Waterman was the \u003cem\u003eWilliam Hopper\u003c/em\u003e, leased from Central Gulf Lines. When she visited New York, Exxon supplied her with its own fuel. When she visited Jeddah, EXXON got her fuel from Arabian Marine Operating Company. EXXON paid Arabian Marine, but Waterman went bankrupt before paying EXXON. In the bankruptcy proceedings, Central Gulf agreed to pay EXXON if a court found the \u003cem\u003eWilliam Hooper\u003c/em\u003e liable \u003cem\u003ein rem\u003c/em\u003e. Invoking \u003cem\u003eMinturn\u003c/em\u003e and its progeny, the Southern District of New York agreed with Central Gulf Lines that Exxon\u0027s claim for the fuel procured in Jeddah was one of agency, and therefore outside admiralty jurisdiction. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed without opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhether a contract to procure for a vessel fuel from a third party is a maritime contract within admiralty jurisdiction and enforceable in an action \u003cem\u003ein rem\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. A unanimous Court reversed and remanded, finding \u003cem\u003eMinturn v. Maynard\u003c/em\u003e obsolete in light of subsequent developments in maritime law. Because the modern test for admiralty jurisdiction in contract cases turns not on the contract\u0027s type but on its purpose, a contract like this one between EXXON and Waterman, i.e., an agency contract for services maritime in nature, ought to qualify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbstract prepared by Professor John Paul Jones, University of Richmond School of Law\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24331,"name":"Francis A.

When Acevedo put the bag in the trunk of his car and began to drive away, the officers stopped the car, searched the bag, and found marijuana. At his trial, Acevedo made a motion to suppress the marijuana as evidence, since the police had not had a search warrant. When the trial court denied his motion, Acevedo pleaded guilty and appealed the denial of the motion. The California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court, ruling that the marijuana should have been suppressed as evidence. The Supreme Court had ruled previously that officers can thoroughly search an automobile if they have probable cause to believe there is evidence somewhere in the vehicle ( \u003cem\u003eU.S. v. Ross\u003c/em\u003e ), and also that officers need a warrant to search a closed container ( \u003cem\u003eU.S. v. Chadwick\u003c/em\u003e ). The California Court of Appeal decided that the latter case was more relevant. Since the officers only had probable cause to believe the bag contained evidence - not the car generally - they could not open the bag without a search warrant. The California Supreme Court denied review, but the Supreme Court granted the State\u0027s petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the Fourth Amendment, may police conduct a warrantless search of a container within an automobile if they have probable cause to believe that the container holds evidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 decision authored by Justice Harry Blackmun, the Court reversed the Court of Appeal and ruled that the \"automobile exception\" to the Fourth Amendment\u0027s general search-warrant requirement is broad enough to cover a situation where the police only have probable cause to believe there is evidence in a specific movable container within the car. The Court noted that the warrant requirement previously had depended on a \"curious line between the search of an automobile that coincidentally turns up a container and the search of a container that coincidentally turns up in an automobile.\" In place of that uncertain distinction, the Court adopted a single rule: \"The police may search an automobile and the containers within it where they have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained.\" Justices White, Stevens, and Marshall dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39203,"name":"Robert Foster","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/robert_foster","view_count":0,"last_name":"Foster","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"robert_foster"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15300"},{"advocate":{"ID":23525,"name":"Fred W.

Garner then filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, asking the Bankruptcy Court to discharge (that is, nullify) his court-ordered repayment to Grogan. Grogan argued that the debt should not be discharged because section 523(a) of the bankruptcy code exempts obligations for money obtained by \"actual fraud.\" The Bankruptcy Court, based on portions of the fraud case, agreed and did not allow Garner to discharge the debt. The District Court affirmed, but the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the standard of proof used in the original fraud case - the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard - was lower than the standard of proof demanded under section 523(a) - a \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard. The Court found that most states used the \"clear and convincing\" standard in fraud cases and that Congress would have explicitly stated it if they used a different standard. Moreover, it argued that the intention of the bankruptcy code to provide a \"fresh start\" suggested that the standard most favorable to bankruptcy filers should be used (that is, the more demanding \"clear and convincing\" standard).\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhat standard of evidence should bankruptcy courts apply in considering whether a debt was the result of \"actual fraud\" under section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eCourts should apply the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. Justice John Paul Stevens, for a unanimous Supreme Court, wrote that the lack of a specified standard of evidence in section 523(a) implied that Congress had intended the preponderance of the evidence standard to be used. That lower standard was generally used in civil actions between private parties (including bankruptcy filings) unless particularly important interests were at stake. Protecting a bankruptcy filer who had previously been convicted of fraud was not sufficiently important to demand a higher level of evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStevens also wrote that the \"fresh start\" intention of the bankruptcy laws did not suggest a higher standard of evidence. \"In the same breath that we have invoked this \u0027fresh start policy,\" he wrote, \"we have been careful to explain that the Act limits the opportunity for a completely unencumbered new beginning to the \u0027honest but unfortunate debtor.\u0027\" A debtor previously convicted of fraud did not fit this description.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35932,"name":"Michael J.

Terrance Bostick, a passenger, was questioned by two officers who sought permission to search his belongings and advised him of his right to refuse. After obtaining Bostick\u0027s permission, the officers searched his bags, found cocaine, and arrested him on drug trafficking charges. Bostick filed a motion to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was illegally obtained, but the trial court denied the motion. Following an affirmance and certification from the Florida Court of Appeals, the State Supreme Court held that the bus searches were per se unconstitutional because police did not afford passengers the opportunity to \"leave the bus\" in order to avoid questioning. Florida appealed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the acquisition of evidence during random bus searches, conducted pursuant to passengers\u0027 consent, a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment\u0027s protection against unconstitutional search and seizure?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court, in a 6-to-3 decision, noted that when deciding if a search request is overly coercive, within a confined space such as a bus, one must not look at whether a party felt \"free to leave,\" but whether a party felt free to decline or terminate the search encounter. The Court held that in the absence of intimidation or harassment, Bostick could have refused the search request. Moreover, the fact that he knew the search would produce contraband had no bearing on whether his consent was voluntarily obtained. The test of whether a \"reasonable person\" felt free to decline or terminate a search presupposes his or her innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33983,"name":"Kenneth W.

The Act grants the Attorney General the authority to add or remove substances and to move substances among the schedules. The Act also lays out specific procedures in order for the Attorney General to exercise this authority. Because the procedures lengthened the process of making any changes to the enforcement of the Act, drug manufacturers were able to develop products that took advantage of unforeseen loopholes in the Act. In 1984, Congress amended the Act to allow the Attorney General to temporarily schedule drugs, which expedited the enforcement process. The Attorney General then delegated these temporary scheduling powers to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), which temporarily scheduled the designer drug “Euphoria” as a Schedule I substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, the DEA executed a valid search warrant on the home of Daniel and Lyrissa Touby, where they found a fully operational Euphoria laboratory. The Toubys were indicted for manufacturing and conspiring to manufacture Euphoria. They moved for dismissal by arguing that the Controlled Substances Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the Attorney General and the Attorney General improperly delegated authority to the DEA. The district court denied the motion, and the Toubys were convicted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Controlled Substances Act unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to the Attorney General?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1)Does the Act allow the Attorney General to delegate authority to the Drug Enforcement Agency?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that the nondelegation doctrine allows Congress to seek the assistance of other branches of government by leaving a certain degree of discretion up to other actors. By providing sufficient guidance to, and placing specific restrictions on, the Attorney General in the Controlled Substances Act, Congress did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power. The Court also held that the Act permits the Attorney General to delegate authority to other officers and employees of the Department of Justice, so the delegation to the Drug Enforcement Agency was appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote that the Controlled Substances Act allows judicial review as a method of ensuring the constitutionality of the temporary scheduling and delegation. He also argued that the issue of delegation of powers within a branch of government is addressed by the Due Process Clause, and the majority’s decision does not examine the case within that framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31305,"name":"Joel I.

(\"Johnson\") manufactures batteries whose assembly process entails exposure to high levels of lead. After discovering that eight of its female employees became pregnant while maintaining blood lead levels in excess of those thought safe by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Johnson barred all its female employees - except those with medically documented infertility - from engaging in tasks that require exposure to lead in access of recommended OSHA levels. Following its passage, the United Automobile Workers (UAW) challenged Johnson\u0027s fetal-protection policy as sexually discriminatory in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (Act). When the Appellate Court affirmed a district court decision in favor of Johnson, the UAW appealed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a policy barring the participation of potentially fertile and pregnant women in occupations that could be detrimental to their reproductive capacities constitute sexual discrimination in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous decision, the Court noted that even well intentioned proposals are forbidden if they result in discrimination. Johnson\u0027s fetal-protection plan discriminated against women by not requiring their male counterparts to demonstrate proof of medical sterility, despite the fact that lead exposure has also proved hazardous to male reproductive systems. The Court added that Johnson\u0027s fetal-protection plan fell outside the bona fide occupational qualification exception of Title VII, since the exception only permits employers to discriminate based on qualities that detrimentally impact on an employee\u0027s job performance. In the present case, although lead exposure may be harmful to the unborn, Johnson furnished no proof that it detracted from its female employees\u0027 abilities to perform any of their essential tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35507,"name":"Marsha S.

In addition to emphasizing Missouri\u0027s, or any other state\u0027s, Tenth Amendment right to define the qualifications of its highest state officials, the Court held that the regulations of the ADEA did not apply to \"policy-making\" appointees such as state court judges. With respect to the petitioners\u0027 Equal Protection challenge, the Court employed a rational basis test to examine whether a rational relationship existed between Missouri\u0027s goal of promoting competent state court judges and its retirement requirement. Noting the connection between increasing age and declining mental and physical capacities, the Court held that Missouri\u0027s retirement requirement for judges who reach the age of seventy was not unreasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32840,"name":"Jim J.

He followed in his car, and eventually pulled Jimeno over for a traffic violation. He told him he had reason to believe Jimeno had drugs in the car, and asked for permission to search it. Jimeno consented, and a search revealed a brown paper bag with cocaine inside it. At trial, Jimeno argued that his consent to the search of the car did not extend to the closed paper bag within the car. The trial court agreed, excluded the drugs found inside the bag as the product of an unconstitutional search under the Fourth Amendment. The Florida District Court of Appeal and the Florida Supreme Court both affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a suspect\u0027s consent to a search of his vehicle extend to closed containers found inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-to-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u0027s prohibition of unreasonable searches. \"The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness,\" wrote Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in the majority opinion. \"We think it was objectively reasonable for the police to conclude that the general consent to search respondent\u0027s car included consent to search containers within that car which might bear drugs.

Rehnquist delivered the opinion for a 6-3 court. The Court overruled \u003cem\u003eBooth v. Maryland\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eSouth Carolina v. Gathers\u003c/em\u003e which prohibited the submission of evidence relating to the harms caused by the victim\u0027s death. The Court reasoned that since \"[v]irtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances,\" the prosecution must be allowed to submit similar counter evidence. Evidence regarding the \"assessment of the harm caused by the defendant has long been an important factor in determining the appropriate punishment, and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing authority about such harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31598,"name":"J.

Minnick and James Dyess escaped from the Clark County Jail.  The next day, they broke into a mobile home to search for weapons.  While in the home, the owner returned with a friend and the friend’s infant son.  Minnick and Dyess shot and killed the two adults and tied up two young women who arrived later.  Minnick and Dyess fled to Mexico, but after a falling out, Minnick went to California alone where police arrested him on a warrant for the Mississippi murders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the arrest, two FBI officers came to interview Minnick at the San Diego Jail.  Minnick refused, asking the officers to “Come back Monday when I have a lawyer.”  Minnick did meet with an appointed lawyer on two or three occasions.  The next Monday, the deputy sheriff of Clark County came to question Minnick.  Prison officials told Minnick he “could not refuse” to speak to the sheriff.  The deputy sheriff advised Minnick of his rights and Minnick refused to sign a waiver form.  Minnick then confessed to one of the murders, saying that Dyess forced him to shoot.  At trial, Minnick moved to suppress those statements, but the court denied the motion, reasoning that \u003ci\u003eEdwards v Arizona\u003c/i\u003e only required counsel to be made available to an accused.  Minnick argued that he was entitled to have counsel present at all questioning.  The jury found Minnick guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death.  The Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed, holding that Minnick’s Fifth Amendment right to counsel was satisfied because he had met with counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e Does \u003ci\u003eEdwards v Arizona\u003c/i\u003e require counsel to be present with an accused during any questioning after that accused invokes his right to counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for a 6-2 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that once counsel is requested, no interrogation can take place without counsel unless the accused waives that right.  The right to counsel is not satisfied by merely meeting with counsel outside the interrogation room.  The \u003ci\u003eEdwards\u003c/i\u003e protection did end as soon as an accused meets with counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia dissented, writing that there was no justification for creating a rebuttable presumption that an accused has not waived his right to counsel after invoking that right.

He gave court records concerning another party\u0027s candidate for lieutenant governor to the St. Paul Pioneer Press and the Minneapolis Star and Tribune. Though he had received a promise of confidentiality from the reporters, the papers identified Cohen in their stories. He was fired as a result. Cohen sued the papers in state court, alleging a breach of contract. At trial, Cohen won compensatory damages and the state appellate court upheld the award. But the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, ruling that Cohen\u0027s claim relied on state \"promissory estoppel\" law, a law that essentially prevented a promisor from breaking a promise. The court ruled that the First Amendment\u0027s free press guarantee prevented promissory estoppel from applying to the newspapers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment bar a plaintiff from recovering damages, under state promissory estoppel law, for a newspaper\u0027s breach of a promise of confidentiality?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice Byron White, the Court held that the First Amendment did not bar a promissory estoppel suit against the press. The Court first affirmed that such a cause of action, though private, triggered the First Amendment\u0027s protection. But the Court went on to rule that the state\u0027s promissory estoppel law was generally applicable and did not target the press. The law\u0027s enforcement against the press thus did not require stricter scrutiny than would its enforcement against other individuals or institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23004,"name":"Elliot C.

Rural also publishes a telephone directory that consists of white and yellow pages. Feist Publications, Inc. is a publishing company that specializes in area-wide telephone directories that cover a much larger geographic range than Rural\u0027s directories. When Rural refused to license its white pages listings to Feist, Feist extracted the listings it needed from Rural\u0027s directory without consent. Although Feist altered many of Rural\u0027s listings, several were identical to listings in Rural\u0027s white pages. The District Court granted summary judgment to Rural in its copyright infringement suit, holding that telephone directories are copyrightable. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the copyright in a telephone company\u0027s directory protect the names, towns, and telephone numbers copied by another telephone directory company?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 9-0 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that the names, towns, and telephone numbers copied by Feist were not original to Rural and therefore were not protected by the copyright in Rural\u0027s combined white and yellow pages directory. The Court reasoned that Rural\u0027s white pages did not satisfy the minimum constitutional standards for copyright protection because the information they contained lacked the requisite originality, as Rural had not selected, coordinated, or arranged the uncopyrightable facts in any original way. \"Because Rural\u0027s white pages lack the requisite originality, Feist\u0027s use of the listings cannot constitute infringement,\" wrote Justice O\u0027Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29670,"name":"James M.

(FABI) began a \"freeze-out\" merger in which the First American Bank of Virginia (Bank) merged into Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (VBI), a wholly owned subsidiary of FABI. VBI already owned 85% of the Bank\u0027s shares, and would acquire the remaining 15% from the Bank\u0027s minority shareholders. The Bank\u0027s executive committee and full board approved the merger at $42 a share. The directors then solicited proxies for voting on the proposed merger at the next annual meeting. In their solicitation, the directors stated that they approved the plan because the price allowed the minority shareholders to achieve a \"high\" value for their stock. Sandberg did not give her approval of the merger and brought suit, the federal ground for which was soliciting proxies in violation of SEC Rule 14a-9, which prohibits the solicitation of proxies by means of materially false or misleading statements. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find for Sandberg as long as the proxy solicitation involved material misstatements, and the proxy solicitation was an \"essential link\" in the merger process. The jury found for Sandberg, awarding her $18 a share, finding that she would have received that much more if the stock had been valued adequately.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eFirst, can a proxy statement couched in conclusory or qualitative terms, such as \"high value,\" purporting to explain the directors\u0027 reasons for recommending a corporate action, be materially misleading within the meaning of Rule 14a-9? Second, can causation of damages compensable under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Section 78n(a), be shown by members of a class of minority shareholders whose votes are not required by law or corporate bylaw to authorize the corporate action subject to the proxy solicitation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no, respectively. Terms like \"high value,\" in a commercial context, are reasonably understood to rest on a factual basis, and so could be shown to be misleading by garden-variety evidence. Furthermore, they can be materially misleading even if other information is available in the statement upon which an expert could deduce that they are false. A proxy statement should inform, not challenge the reader\u0027s critical wits. However, the link between the statement and the merger process is too speculative and too procedurally intractable to find an implied private right of action in cases in which the minority shareholders\u0027 votes are not required by law or corporate bylaw, and where the plaintiff\u0027s theory is that the vote was cosmetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42002,"name":"Stephen M.

He may also appoint them to \"any other proceeding which the chief judge may designate,\" but in those unspecified cases the special trial judge may not issue a final decision, only draft an opinion which must be reviewed by a regular judge of the Tax Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreytag and several other defendants were charged with using a tax shelter to avoid paying roughly $1.5 billion in taxes. They consented to have their case heard by a special trial judge. The trial judge eventually drafted an opinion unfavorable to their position, which was reviewed and adopted by the Chief Judge. They then appealed the case, arguing that their case was too complex to assign to a special trial judge under section 7443A. Congress\u0027s decision to allow the Chief Judge to make such an assignment, they argued, violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution (Article II Section 2), which provides that Congress may \"vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\" Freytag asserted that the \"Courts of Law\" referred to there were only Article III courts (Federal District Courts, Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the Supreme Court, all of which have judges with lifetime tenure), and that the Chief Judge was part of an Article I court, meaning that Congress could not assign him the power of appointment. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument, affirming the Tax Court\u0027s decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes 26 U.S.C. 7443A(a) permit the assignment of particularly complex cases dealing with large amounts of money to \"special trial judges\" appointed by the Chief Judge of the U.S. Tax Court, provided that the special trial judges do not enter the decision but simply prepare an opinion for review and adoption by a regular Tax Court judge? Under the Appointments Clause of Article II Section 2, may Congress permit the Chief Judge of the U.S. Tax Court to appoint \"special trial judges\" to \"any other proceeding which the chief judge may designate\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. On the question of whether 7443A permitted the assignment of complex cases to special trial judges, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the statute unambiguously did allow such appointments. Justice Harry Blackmun, in the majority opinion, wrote, \"The plain language of 7443A(b)(4) surely authorizes the Chief Judge\u0027s assignment of petitioners\u0027 cases to a special trial judge. When we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry should be complete except in rare and exceptional circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Appointments Clause question, however, the Court was divided 5-to-4. Justice Blackmun wrote for the majority that Article I Courts, like Article III Courts, exercised the judicial power of the United States and were therefore \"Courts of Law\" for purposes of Article II Section 2. While they may have been more dependent on Congress than the other branches, they were nevertheless independent, and it therefore did not violate the separation of powers to allow them to make appointments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33975,"name":"Kathleen M.

He was later arrested in New York for an unrelated crime after the murder and incarcerated. While in prison he became friends with Anthony Sarivola, an inmate paid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect information on other inmates while he served his term. Fulminante initially denied killing his stepdaughter to Sarivola, but admitted it when Sarivola offered him protection from other inmates in exchange for the truth. After his release, Fulminante also confessed to Donna Sarivola, Anthony\u0027s wife. Fulminante was indicted for murder in Arizona. Fulminante argued in trial court that his two confessions to the Sarivolas could not be used as evidence since the first was coerced and the second based on the first. The court admitted his confessions as evidence, convicted him, and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court ordered Fulminante to be retried without the use of the confessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did the Arizona Supreme Court properly apply the totality of circumstances test when considering whether a suspect\u0027s confession to murder was coerced?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the Arizona Supreme Court properly apply harmless error analysis when considering whether the suspect\u0027s coerced confession influenced the trial outcome?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. Justice Byron R. White and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered parts of the opinion, both majorities by a 5-4 vote. The Court held that Fulminante was coerced to confess in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court found that \"it was fear of physical violence, absent protection from his friend Sarivola, which motivated Fulminante to confess.\" This motivation invalidated his confession. Since Fulminante\u0027s confession to Donna Sarivola was closely tied to his first coerced confession, the Court dismissed both. The Court also found that the confessions played a determinative role in the trial. It maintained that a \"successful prosecution depended on the jury\u0027s believing the two confessions.\" Because the confessions were critical to the outcome of the trial, the fact that they were obtained coercively could not be dismissed as a harmless error. Four justices dissented to using harmless error analysis for coerced confessions on the ground that confessions always significantly affect a trial\u0027s outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17757,"name":"Barbara M.

The fair market value of the mortgages it gave away, however, were worth $2.5 million less than their original value. In accordance with the accounting procedures of the federal regulatory body of savings and loan corporations, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), Cottage Savings recorded the exchanged properties as \"substantially identical\" (because they had the same fair market value).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cottage Savings filed its federal income tax return, however, it claimed a $2.5 million loss - the difference between the original value of the mortgages it gave away and the current value of the mortgages it received in return. The IRS refused to recognize the difference as a deductible loss, however, because under section 1001(a) of Title 26 of the tax code, the change in a property\u0027s value is only taken into consideration when it is realized through the \"sale or disposition of [the] property.\" An exchange of property only constitutes a \"disposition\" if there is a \"material difference\" between the properties exchanged. Because Cottage Savings had reported the properties exchanged as \"substantially identical,\" the IRS ruled, a \"disposition\" could not have taken place and the loss in value could not be deducted. Cottage savings took the issue to a federal Tax Court, which disagreed with the IRS and ruled the deduction permissible. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, however, siding with the IRS.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the exchange of properties considered \"substantially identical\" for accounting purposes under Federal Home Loan Bank Board regulations be considered a \"disposition of property\" for IRS tax purposes, given that properties exchanged must be materially different to constitute a \"disposition\" under section 1001(a) of Title 26 of the tax code?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-to-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the definition of \"substantially identical\" under the FHLBB regulations was intentionally flexible and broad enough to include even properties that were \"materially different\" for IRS purposes. Justice Thurgood Marshall, in the majority opinion, wrote that exchanged properties are \"materially different\" if they \"embody legally distinct entitlements.\" The properties involved in this exchange clearly satisfied that test. \"Because the participation interests exchanged by Cottage Savings and the other S \u0026amp; L\u0027s derived from loans that were made to different obligors and secured by different homes, the exchanged interests did embody legally distinct entitlements. Consequently, we conclude that Cottage Savings realized its losses at the point of exchange.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21256,"name":"Dennis L.

Malcolm_s article included many long direct quotations from Masson. The article presented Masson as extremely arrogant and condescending; at one point, he was quoted as calling himself \"the greatest analyst who ever lived.\" However, Malcolm fabricated many of the more distasteful quotations. Masson sued for libel. The District Court dismissed the case on First Amendment free speech grounds because Masson was a public figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment give the New Yorker a right to publish fabricated quotations attributed to a public figure?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 9-0 vote, the Court ruled that the First Amendment \u003cem\u003es free expression clause could not protect the distortions in Malcolm\u003c/em\u003e s article. Justice Anthony Kennedy\u0027s majority opinion also explained when a direct quotation can be considered false, and therefore potentially libelous. The First Amendment limits libel suits by public figures. A report about a public figure cannot be considered \"false\" unless it is a gross distortion of the truth. Justice Kennedy\u0027s opinion explained that a direct quotation will qualify as such a distortion if the quoted words differ in their factual meaning from anything the public figure really said. Malcolm_s fabrication qualified as a \"gross distortion,\" and the Court granted Masson standing to sue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19515,"name":"Charles Morgan, Jr.","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/charles_morgan_jr","view_count":0,"last_name":"Morgan,","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"charles_morgan_jr"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/15477"},{"advocate":{"ID":27019,"name":"H.

He pleaded not guilty, and invoked his right to a jury trial. During the jury selection process, Powers objected when the prosecution excluded a black individual from the jury without explanation. The court denied the request for explanation. The prosecution struck nine more possible jurors, of which six were black. Powers objected each time, but the court overruled his objection. The jury convicted Powers on all charges. Powers appealed his conviction and argued that the prosecution’s discriminatory selection of jurors violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution, and that his own race was irrelevant to the right to object. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the appeal. The petitioner sought review before the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1 sections 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution allow a criminal defendant to make objections to race-based exclusions of jurors by the State during the jury selection process if the defendant and the jurors are of different races?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the prosecution is prohibited from excluding an unbiased and qualified juror based on the person’s race regardless of the race of the defendant. Although an individual does not have the right to sit on a jury, every citizen has the right not to be deprived of the opportunity to participate in this aspect of civil life. The Court also held that a criminal defendant has the right to raise objections on racial discrimination when excluding certain potential jurors because it could cause potential injury to the defendant. The defendant must feel that he is receiving a fair trial and that the integrity of the judicial system is upheld. Therefore the defendant, as well as the juror, has the right to eliminate racial discrimination in the courtroom and the color of his skin is irrelevant to these objections of racial discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17140,"name":"Alan C.
