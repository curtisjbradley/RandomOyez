To combat this concentration of ownership, the legislature enacted the Land Reform Act of 1967. The Act adopted a method of redistribution in which title in real property could be taken from lessors and transferred to lessees. Frank E. Midkiff, a landholder, challenged the Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Land Reform Act of 1967 violate the Public Use Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court held that the Public Use Clause did not preclude Hawaii from taking title in real property, with just compensation, for the purpose of reducing the concentration of ownership. Noting that Hawaii\u0027s statute was rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, the Court argued that \"debates over the wisdom of takings\" were best carried out by legislatures, not by federal courts. The Court also held that the fact that the property taken by eminent domain was transferred to private beneficiaries did not condemn the law to having a solely private purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35187,"name":"Laurence H.

Females and older males were limited to associate membership in which they were prevented from voting or holding local or national office. Two chapters of the Jaycees in Minnesota, contrary to the bylaws, admitted women as full members. When the national organization revoked the chapters\u0027 licenses, they filed a discrimination claim under a Minnesota anti-discrimination law. The national organization brought a lawsuit against Kathryn Roberts of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, who was responsible for the enforcement of the anti-discrimination law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Minnesota\u0027s attempts to enforce the anti-discrimination law violate the Jaycees\u0027 right to free association under the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court held that the Jaycees chapters lacked \"the distinctive characteristics that might afford constitutional protection to the decision of its members to exclude women.\" The Court reasoned that making women full members would not impose any serious burdens on the male members\u0027 freedom of expressive association. The Court thus held that Minnesota\u0027s compelling interest in eradicating discrimination against women justified enforcement of the state anti-discrimination law. The Court found that the Minnesota law was not aimed at the suppression of speech and did not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40665,"name":"Richard L.

She and her husband, a Thai citizen who entered the country in 1968, were granted permission to stay until July 1971. When their visas expired, they chose to stay without the permission of the proper authorities. In January 1977, Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) commenced deportation processes on the couple. They applied for a suspension, which an immigration judge granted to Phinpathya’s husband but denied for her because she did not meet the continuous residency requirement. Phinpathya’s own testimony showed that she left the country in 1974 and improperly obtained a visa from the US consular office in Thailand for her return three months later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the judge’s ruling and held that Phinpathya’s illegal status when she left and returned to the US made the absence “meaningfully interruptive” of her residency and made her ineligible for the suspension of deportation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that, despite her absence, Phinpathya’s intent was always to return to the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the “continuous physical presence” requirement for suspension of deportation in the Immigration and Nationality Act be interpreted literally?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion of the 9-0 court. The Supreme Court held that, in the absence of any language or legislative history indicating flexibility in the requirements, the section should be interpreted based on its plain meaning. Other immigration legislation has shown that when Congress intends there to be exceptions, the wording of the relevant statute reflects that intention. The Court also held that Congress intended the requirements to present a high threshold to suspension, and therefore the “continuous presence” requirement should not be interpreted loosely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment where he argued that Phinpathya’s unexplained three-month absence from the country was enough to disqualify her from a suspension of deportation without requiring the Supreme Court to address the issue of the meaning of the “continuous presence” requirement. He argued further that Congress did not intend the requirement to be taken literally in situations that would be unreasonable, but rather it was intended to prevent abuses.

Eight hours later, the police re-entered the facility, without a warrant, and searched the car a second time. A Florida court suppressed evidence obtained in the second search, arguing the warrantless search was unconstitutional. The Florida Supreme Court denied review.

Engle was an employee of a plant owned and operated by the Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler dismissed him on December 4th, 1972. Engle suffered from alcoholism, and he drank heavily following his dismissal. On December 7th, he consumed four anti-anxiety Librium pills and large quantities of whiskey. That day, he returned to the plant and told his nephew Chrysler employee Renus Engle, that he was going to kill someone. Renus Engle testified that the Tilden had a nervous pitch to his voice and tears in his eyes. According to Renus Engle, the respondent had been drinking but was not drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngle went to the office of Donald Ambrose, a clerk, and asked for Regis Lantzy, whom Engle believed was responsible for his termination. Ambrose said that Lantzy was not present, and later testified that Engle looked strange, as if something was troubling him. A short time later, Engle found Lantzy in the plant. Engle shot Lantzy with a pistol in front of several workers. Lantzy tried to flee, and Engle shot him several more times. He stood over the body briefly, then returned to Ambrose\u0027s office and surrendered to a security guard. The guard smelled alcohol on Engle\u0027s breath, but officers who arrived later on the scene did not detect the odor of alcohol. On December 8th, Engle gave a statement to the police. He admitted to purposefully shooting and killing Lantzy, albeit under the influence of alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn trial for murder in July, 1973, Engle\u0027s sole defense was temporary insanity due to the effects of alcohol, Librium, and a dissociative reaction, a temporary mental disorder often accompanied by memory loss. He stated that he remembered nothing between drinking the morning of December 7th and the moment he awoke in jail. He did not remember making a statement to the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trial judge instructed the jury that malice --a necessary element for conviction-- is \"implied from any deliberate and cruel act against another person.\" Regarding Engle\u0027s use of a pistol, the trial judge instructed the jury that \"a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts.\" He also instructed the jury to consider the number and location of Lantzy\u0027s wounds when considering the issue of malice. Engle was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. He appealed, arguing the jury instructions constituted reversible error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA unanimous U.S. Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, reversed. It rejected Koehler\u0027s argument that Engle\u0027s failure to make a timely objection prevented him from raising the issue of jury instruction on appeal, noting that Michigan courts do not enforce a contemporaneous objection rule. The court held that the jury could have inferred from the instructions that the burden of proving lack of malice and intent lay with Engle. He also argued that the jury could have presumed from the use of a deadly weapon and the number and location of Lantzy\u0027s wounds that these facts alone constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Engle\u0027s malice and intent. He held that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, pointing to conflicting evidence about Engle\u0027s state of mind at the time of the shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the jury instructions on malice and intent create an improper presumption of guilt in Engle\u0027s trial for first-degree murder? If so, was this a harmless error?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. In a \u003cem\u003eper curiam\u003c/em\u003e opinion delivered by an equally divided Court, the Supreme Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit\u0027s judgment without further comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Marshall took no part in the decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34272,"name":"Louis J.

Because Yermian would have access to classified materials in the course of his job, he had to fill out a security questionnaire. On the form, Yermian failed to note that he had been convicted of mail fraud in 1978. He also claimed to have worked at two companies where he had never been employed. He signed a certificate stating that his answers were “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” Government investigators later discovered that Yermian’s statements were false. When the investigators confronted him with the statements, he admitted to knowingly providing false information. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his trial, Yermian requested a jury instruction requiring the government to prove that he had knowledge not only of the falseness of his statements, but also that he had knowledge that a federal agency had jurisdiction. The district court rejected the instruction, and Yermian was convicted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the district court had erred by not allowing the requested instruction. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the government have to prove knowledge of federal agency jurisdiction in cases that deal with making false statements to a government department or agency?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Lewis F. Powell delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the language of the statute applied the requirement of knowledge to the act of making false statements, rather than the jurisdiction. The Court also held that there was no legislative history to support the reading that Congress intended intent to deceive the federal government to be an element of the crime. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote that there was a great deal of ambiguity in the statute regarding to which element the knowledge requirement applied. He argued that, without any clues in the statute, the majority’s opinion cannot simply decide what the phrase “knowingly and willfully” is meant to modify. He also argued that there was no evidence to suggest that Congress intended to expand the definition of the crime to any false statement that could fall under the jurisdiction of a federal agency. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice John Paul Stevens, and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18561,"name":"Carolyn F.

Each of those companies had the rights to air 14 live games per season as well as to negotiate individually with the competing schools, and they were required to pay a “minimum aggregate compensation” to the participating schools. The goal of the plan was to televise games in such a way as to not drastically decrease live attendance at the games. The NCAA did not permit any of the schools to negotiate outside of this plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia are both members of the College Football Association (CFA), a group within the NCAA that was formed to represent and promote the interests of the major football schools. These schools, along with the other schools in the CFA, negotiated a separate contract with NBC that would allow for more televised games and greater revenues for the schools in question. The NCAA then announced that it would take disciplinary action against any school that complied with the CFA plan as opposed to the NCAA one. The respondent schools took the issue to the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, which found that the NCAA contract violated the Sherman Act. The Court of Appeals for Oklahoma affirmed the judgment of the lower court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the NCAA plan for televised football games impose a restraint on the free market and thus violate the Sherman Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for a 7-2 majority, held that the NCAA plan creates a structure in which the market cannot be responsive to viewer demands in terms of price and output. Since the viewers of college football games can be defined as a distinct market,  a plan that places the NCAA in complete control of the broadcasts that reach this market creates the type of monopoly that the Sherman Act was meant to prevent. By limiting the number of live broadcasts, the Court found that the NCAA was attempting to artificially increase the value of live tickets, in the same way that a monopolist seeks to manipulate the market by limiting output. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissent, Justice Byron R. White argued that the Court erred by treating the NCAA as a purely commercial and profit-oriented organization. Because the NCAA is uniquely linked to both amateur athletics and higher education, it has been allowed a great deal of leeway in regulation that would be condemned in a purely business environment. He further argued that the NCAA plan “reflects the NCAA’s fundamental policy of preserving amateurism and integrating athletics and education.” Justice William H. Rehnquist joined Justice White in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23867,"name":"Frank H.

During recruitment, Hishon had been told that after five or six years there was a possibility of promotion to partner; associates with “satisfactory evaluations” would be promoted to partner on a “fair and equal basis.” Hishon claimed to have relied on this information when making her decision to accept employment with the Firm. After six years of employment, Hishon was considered for admission to the partnership and was ultimately rejected. One year later Hishon was again considered for admission and again rejected. She was told to begin seeking new employment and was let go in December 1979.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn November 1979, Hishon sued the Firm and filed her claim with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. Hishon claimed that she was discriminated against on the basis of her sex and that this discrimination violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Commission issued a notice of right to sue, and Hishon sued in federal district court. The district court dismissed her claim, and Hishon appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed that ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid King \u0026amp; Spalding violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and unfairly discriminate against Hishon on the basis of her sex by denying her admission to the partnership?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Court held that Title VII makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate against any employee on the basis of their sex. In this case, the Court held that the promise of equal consideration for partnership that went along with Hishon’s employment was contractual in nature and subject to the regulations of Title VII. By preventing Hishon from obtaining partnership because of her sex, the Firm discriminated against her and breached the “terms, conditions or privileges of employment,” and therefore the Firm acted in direct violation of Title VII.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote a concurring opinion noting that the Court’s opinion should be careful to not go to far in interfering with a firm’s ability to make partner decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21951,"name":"Emmet J.

SAMTA argued that it was providing a \"traditional\" governmental function, which exempted it from federal controls according to the doctrine of federalism established in National League of Cities v. Usery (1976). Joe G. Garcia, an employee of SAMTA, brought suit for overtime pay under Fair Labor Standards Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid principles of federalism make the San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority immune from the Fair Labor Standards Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that the guiding principles of federalism established in National League of Cities v. Usery were unworkable and that SAMTA was subject to Congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause. The Court found that rules based on the subjective determination of \"integral\" or \"traditional\" governmental functions provided little or no guidance in determining the boundaries of federal and state power. The Court argued that the structure of the federal system itself, rather than any \"discrete limitations\" on federal authority, protected state sovereignty.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44300,"name":"William T.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) passed a regulation under the Act that allows states to treat all pollution-emitting devices in the same industrial grouping as though they were a single “bubble”.  Using this bubble provision, plants may install or modify one piece of equipment without needing a permit if the alteration does not increase the total emissions of the plant.  Several environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, challenged the bubble provision as contrary to the Act.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit set aside the EPA regulation as inappropriate for a program enacted to improve air quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Clean Air Act permit the EPA  to define the term \"stationary source\" to mean whole industrial plants only, which allows plants to build or modify units within plants without the permit required under the Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for a unanimous court, reversed.  The Supreme Court held that the bubble regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the term “stationary source” in the Clean Air Act.  Congress did not have a specific intention for the interpretation of that term, and the EPA’s regulation was a reasonable policy choice.  The regulation also provided reasonable accommodations for the many competing interests affected by the Act.  Justices Thurgood Marshall, William H. Rehnquist, and Sandra Day O’Connor did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37751,"name":"Paul M.

The Cliffords were out of town, so the Detroit Fire Department arrived, extinguished the fire, and left by around 7 a.m. An hour later, the fire investigator received a notice to inspect the house for evidence of arson. When he and his partner arrived on the scene at 1 p.m., they found a work crew from the Cliffords’ insurance company that the Cliffords had contacted to secure the house. When the work crew had cleared the basement, the fire investigators began to inspect it without obtaining either consent or a warrant. They determined that the fire had started in the basement, where they found several fuel cans and a crock pot attached to a timer, all of which was seized as evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaymond and Emma Jean Clifford were arrested and charged with arson. At the preliminary examination held to determine probable cause, they moved to suppress the evidence as the products of an illegal search made without warrant or consent. The motion was denied. Prior to the trial, there was an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence, and it was admitted because there were exigent circumstances surrounding the search. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and held that there were no exigent circumstances that justified the search.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment allow for arson investigators to inspect the scene of a recent fire without a warrant in the absence of exigent circumstances and consent?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the judgment of the court in an opinion for a four-justice plurality. The Supreme Court held that that a reasonable expectation of privacy remains within a burned building. While the fire department does not need a warrant to fight the fire, any further official presence on the property must have a warrant. Whether the search is to identify the cause of the fire or to look for evidence of criminal activity will determine the type of warrant the fire department needs to obtain and the requirements for doing so. In the case of the fire at the Clifford home, both searches occurred but without the appropriate warrants. The Court also held that there were no exigent circumstances that prevented the investigators from obtaining the warrants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote an opinion concurring in judgment where he argued that once the emergency that has granted the fire fighters authority to enter the premises has ended, the Fourth Amendment requires that notice be given to the property owners before entry. He also argued that if there is probable cause to suspect a crime has occurred, a warrant is required to conduct a search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William H. Rehnquist argued that the fire fighters initially at the scene suspected arson because an investigator was called, which means the investigation and the fighting of the fire were happening simultaneously. The inspection by the fire investigator was a continuation of one that began when the fire fighters were legally on the premises. He also argued that the public interest in investigating the cause of a fire outweighs the property owner’s right to privacy. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29211,"name":"Janice M.

Richard Crisp, the Director of Oklahoma\u0027s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, warned the offending cable operators that their continued transmission of banned beverage commercials would result in criminal prosecution. In response, and on behalf of other cable operators, Capital Cities Cable challenged the constitutionality of Oklahoma\u0027s advertising ban. On appeal from the Tenth Circuit\u0027s reversal of a district court decision favoring Capital Cities Cable, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Oklahoma\u0027s ban against retransmitting out-of-state cable signals containing alcoholic beverage commercials violate the Supremacy or Commerce Clauses?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held unanimously that Oklahoma\u0027s ban on local cable transmissions of out-of-state alcoholic beverage commercials violated both the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses. While Oklahoma can regulate local cable aspects, such as franchise formation and construction, it cannot tamper with the flow of information from other states. Such tampering violates the Federal Communication Commission\u0027s guidelines prohibiting the censorship or alteration of interstate broadcast signals. As such, in the interest of maintaining diverse program offerings and encouraging competition among cable providers, the FCC\u0027s guidelines supercede Oklahoma\u0027s local regulatory authority. Moreover, despite its broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment to regulate the importation and use of intoxicating liquor, the Court held that the federal government retains final authority under the commerce clause to regulate all aspects of interstate liquor commerce. Therefore, Oklahoma\u0027s continued ban on interstate alcoholic advertising violated the Commerce Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36378,"name":"Michael W.

At sentencing, his attorney did not seek out character witnesses or request a psychiatric evaluation. Subsequently, the trial court sentenced Mr. Washington to death finding no mitigating circumstances to rule otherwise. After exhausting his state court remedies, Mr. Washington sought habeas corpus relief in a Florida federal district court. He argued that his Sixth Amendment right was violated because he had ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The district court denied the petition. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. The court held that the Sixth Amendment accorded criminal defendants a right to counsel rendering \"reasonably effective assistance given the totality of the circumstances.\" It then remanded the case to the district court to apply this standard and determine whether Mr. Washington\u0027s counsel was sufficiently prejudicial to justify the reversal of his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhat standard should be applied to determine whether a convicted person\u0027s Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been violated so as to require reversal of a conviction or to set aside a death sentence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court held that: (1) counsel\u0027s performance must be deficient; and (2) the deficient performance must have prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. With Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor writing for the majority, the Court counseled that in making a showing of deficient performance, the defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u0027s representation fell below an \"objective standard of reasonableness.\" The Court also noted that to show prejudice, the defendant must show that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that, but for counsel\u0027s unprofessional errors, the result would have been different. Here, the Court reasoned that Mr. Washington\u0027s counsel was not unreasonable. Moreover, the Court stated that even if counsel was unreasonable, counsel\u0027s conduct did not cause sufficient prejudice to Mr. Washington to warrant setting aside his death sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part. He viewed the death sentence as per se cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Consequently, he would not have upheld Mr. Washington\u0027s sentence. Justice Thurgood Marshall also wrote separately, dissenting. He disagreed with the majority\u0027s holding in that in its attempt to make a uniform standard, it created one so malleable as to be virtually useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20091,"name":"Carolyn M.

The orders were issued based upon each respondent\u0027s admission to Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officials that he had entered the country unlawfully. Lopez-Mendoza and Sandoval-Sanchez challenged the orders on grounds that their respective arrests by INS officials were illegal and in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Sandoval-Sanchez further moved to have his admission suppressed as fruit of an illegal arrest. (Lopez-Mendoza did not move to strike his admission from the record.) In each case, the presiding judge found the legality of the arrests irrelevant to the determination of the respondents\u0027 deportation status. On administrative appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the orders noting that deportation proceedings are civil actions and \"[t]he mere fact of an illegal arrest has no bearing on a subsequent deportation hearing.\" The BIA also found application of the exclusionary rule in a deportation proceeding inappropriate. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed finding the respondents\u0027 arrests were illegal and the resulting admissions fruit of unlawful arrests.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the strictures of the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule apply in deportation proceedings?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In both criminal and civil proceedings, the \"body\" or identity of a defendant is never suppressible as fruit of an illegal arrest. This alone was sufficient basis to uphold Lopez-Mendoza\u0027s deportation order. Moreover, deportation proceedings are civil actions and the protections afforded defendants in the criminal context do not apply. Specifically, Sandoval- Sanchez\u0027s appeal to the exclusionary rule in his motion to suppress his admission fails because the purpose the exclusionary rule is designed to serve \u003cem\u003edeterring official misconduct\u003c/em\u003e is not served in the context of a deportation proceeding. First, the INS is only required to show identity and alienage to meet its burden in a deportation hearing. Since the defendant\u0027s body is not suppressible, the INS must only prove alienage, generally not a difficult task even absent a confession. Further, INS has its own comprehensive oversight program in place to monitor Fourth Amendment compliance internally. The exclusionary rule would do little to enhance these efforts. Finally, deportations hearings, unlike criminal trials, are designed to prevent the continued violation of the law. The social cost of releasing a defendant whose mere presence in the country puts him in continued violation of the law is too high to bear in light of the minimal benefits derived from application of the exclusionary rule in this context.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36023,"name":"Mary L.

Pursuant to this directive, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), acting as the Secretary\u0027s designee, instituted a certification process for the design and manufacture of all private aircraft. Under FAA rules, manufacturers are required to develop the plans and specifications and perform the inspections and tests necessary to establish that an aircraft design comports with the regulations. FAA engineers then conduct \"spot-check\" inspections of the manufacturer\u0027s work. This case arose out of two separate accidents in which commercial aircraft, certified by the FAA or its predecessor, caught fire mid-air, resulting in the deaths of most of the people on board one plane and all of the people on board the other. Each accident was found to have been caused by a faulty part a trash receptacle in one case; a gas burning cabin heater in the other which did not comply with FAA regulations. In both cases, plaintiffs sued the U.S. under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) on the ground that the FAA or its predecessor negligently issued certificates for the respective aircraft. The district court in the first case granted summary judgment on the ground, inter alia, that recovery against the U.S. was barred by 28 U.S.C. Section 2680(a), which provides a discretionary function exception to the FTCA. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the discretionary function exception did not apply, and that the U.S., just as a private party, could be held liable for negligent inspection under the California \"Good Samaritan\" rule. In the other case, the district court entered judgment for plaintiffs under the California \"Good Samaritan\" rule, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the U.S. be held liable under the FTCA for the FAA\u0027s decision to use the \"spot-check\" program to monitor compliance with airworthiness certification standards?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Government liability under the FTCA is limited by the discretionary function exception of 28 U.S.C. Section 2680(a), which provides that the federal government may not be held liable for \"[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government . . . based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function . . . whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\" The FAA\u0027s decision to institute the \"spot-check\" program to monitor compliance with its minimum safety standards was clearly discretionary and protected by Section 2680(a). It was a calculated decision which took into account the objectives of the certification process in light of practical considerations such as funding and staffing. Judicial intervention in such a decision would be precisely what the discretionary function exception was designed to prevent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33830,"name":"Kenneth Steven Geller","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/kenneth_s_geller","view_count":0,"last_name":"Geller","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"kenneth_s_geller"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12976"},{"advocate":{"ID":39303,"name":"Richard F.

The president of Greenmoss quickly learned about the erroneous report, requested Bradstreet to correct its error, and asked for the list of subscribers who received the report. Bradstreet refused to release the names on the list, but issued a correction to its five subscribers who received the original report. The correction stated that actually a former employee of Greenmoss had filed for bankruptcy and that Greenmoss Builders \"continued in business as usual.\" Greenmoss was dissatisfied with the correction and again asked for the list. When Bradstreet refused a second time, Greenmoss filed suit against it for defamation in a Vermont state court. The court discovered that a 17-year-old high student interning for Bradstreet had caused the error and the jury awarded $350,000 to Greenmoss in compensatory and punitive damages. Bradstreet claimed that contrary to the Supreme Court\u0027s ruling in \u003cem\u003eGertz v. Robert Welch\u003c/em\u003e, the trial judge told the jury that it could award punitive damages even if Bradford did not make mistakes intentionally or out of recklessness. The court granted Bradstreet\u0027s motion for retrial, but the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that \u003cem\u003eGertz\u003c/em\u003e only applied to cases involving defamation by the media.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIf a trial judge does not instruct the jury to only award punitive damages caused by intentional slander or reckless conduct, can a jury still award punitive damages to a plaintiff defamed by private speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis Powell authored the opinion for a 5-4 court. Although the trial court correctly perceived that the trial judge\u0027s instructions did not satisfy the requirements of \u003cem\u003eGertz\u003c/em\u003e, the Court held that \u003cem\u003eGertz\u003c/em\u003e did not apply since the present case did not involve public speech. Instead the Court looked to apply the logic of \u003cem\u003eGertz\u003c/em\u003e to situations concerning private speech. The Court reasoned that laws regulating defamation suits aimed to \"balance the State\u0027s interest in compensating private individuals for injury to their reputation against the First Amendment interest in protecting this type [Bradstreet\u0027s] of expression.\" Because the First Amendment offers less protection to private speech than to public speech, and especially less to speech \"being solely motived by a desire for profit,\" damages caused by it can result in heavier penalties and broader conditions for convictions. Therefore states can allow the recovery of punitive damages in defamation cases involving private speech even when the perpetrator does not demonstrate \"actual malice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25379,"name":"Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/gordon_lee_garrett","view_count":0,"last_name":"Garrett,","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"gordon_lee_garrett"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/12978"},{"advocate":{"ID":42855,"name":"Thomas F.

Goldfarb (1977), which invalidated a gender-based dependency requirement in the allocation of Social Security payments, and to the necessity of preventing bankruptcy in the Social Security fund. It enacted amendments in 1977 to the Social Security Act. The 1977 amendments included a \"pension offset\" provision which reduced spousal benefits by the amount of certain federal and state pension funds that a Social Security applicant received. However, Congress exempted from this provision spouses who were eligible to receive pension benefits prior to December 1982 and who would have qualified for unreduced spousal benefits prior to the Court\u0027s Califano decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the resurrection of pre-California law which allowed some gender-based classification in Social Security allocations violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe unanimous Court upheld the law. Justice Brennan granted that the 1977 amendments temporarily revived gender-based eligibility requirements, but maintained that they served a legitimate government interest, namely, they protected individuals who had planned for their retirements relying on the law as it stood before the Court\u0027s Califano decision. The resurrected eligibility criteria were narrowly drawn, applying to those individuals who were eligible for spousal benefits prior to 1977 who retired by 1982. Since many individuals who are planning for retirement rely on the law in making investment and spending decisions, changing the law (as Califano did) without giving some leeway to people who had already planned for the future would place an unreasonable burden on many who were close to retirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29328,"name":"John R.

Of the 11 laborers both companies employed, several were illegal immigrants. In July 1976, eight workers from both companies authorized the Chicago Leather Workers Union to act as their collective bargaining representative. On December 10, 1976, the Union prevailed in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election. The companies filed complaints with the NLRB and alleged that many of the voting members were illegal immigrants. When the NLRB certified the union anyway, the president of Surak Leather Company sent a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to request a check on the immigration status of the employees in question. INS agents discovered five employees were living and working illegally in the United States and deported them. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NLRB’s Acting Regional Director filed complaints alleging that the companies engaged in unfair labor practices, and the charges were heard by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The NLRB adopted the ALJ’s recommendation to order the petitioners to cease and desist the unfair labor practices and substituted backpay for the recommendation of reinstatement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the first part of the Board’s order. However, the Court of Appeals held that, because backpay could only be given for periods of time when the employees were legally eligible but unable to work, the companies should be required to pay a minimum amount of six months worth of backpay.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the National Labor Rights Act allow the National Labor Relations Board to properly find that an employer has engaged in unfair labor practices by reporting illegal union laborers to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in retaliation for economic activity and issue a remedial order?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that that the NLRB can act to protect the labor rights of illegal immigrants because it serves the broader purpose of labor to have all workers represented, regardless of immigration status. Precedent establishes that the Board can protect the rights of any employee. The petitioners’ actions illegally discouraged union activity and caused the deportation of their employees. The Court also held that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit impermissibly expanded its authority by modifying the order of the NLRB in regards to backpay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He argued that the majority erred in remanding the case to the Court of Appeals, as the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed in its entirety. Since the NLRB acquiesced to the remedy provided by the Court of Appeals, no purpose was served by reconsideration. Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part where he argued that illegal aliens are not considered employees under the National Labor Rights Act. Since illegal aliens are actively violating United States criminal laws, the Act does not afford them protection. Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

Justice White reaffirmed what he called a \"cardinal rule of Commerce Clause jurisprudence\" in arguing that states are prohibited from imposing taxes which discriminate in the traffic of interstate commerce.

Among other comments, Consumer Union\u0027s article mistakenly said that Bose loudspeakers caused sounds of individual musical instruments to wander \"about the room\" when they in fact merely wandered \"along the wall[s].\" Ruling in favor of Bose, the District Court found that the article\u0027s statements were factually wrong and made with \"actual malice.\" On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed as it found the lower court\u0027s ruling to be clearly erroneous. The Supreme Court granted Bose certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Consumer Union\u0027s article written with \"actual malice,\" thereby placing it outside the First Amendment\u0027s freedom of speech protections?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court held that while the record revealed that the article\u0027s author mistakenly described the sound path of Bose speakers, he did not do so with actual malice. A review of the author\u0027s testimony showed that he heard the Bose speaker sounds as tending to wander \"along the wall\" between speakers, rather than \"about the room.\" Despite this disparity, the Court held that the description of Bose speaker sounds as wondering \"about the room,\" though a misconception, was not written with actual malice since its author was not aware of his mischaracterization in time to remedy the error. Therefore, his speech was entitled to First Amendment protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36459,"name":"Michael N.

School officials searched her purse suspecting she had cigarettes. The officials discovered cigarettes, a small amount of marijuana, and a list containing the names of students who owed T.L.O. money. T.L.O. was charged with possession of marijuana. Before trial, T.L.O. moved to suppress evidence discovered in the search, but the Court denied her motion. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County found her guilty and sentenced her to probation for one year. On appeal, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress evidence. The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed, holding that the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment applies to searches and seizures conducted by school officials in public schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the exclusionary rule apply to searches conducted by school officials in public schools?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eAfter the original oral argument in March of 1984, the Supreme Court restored the case to the calendar for reargument. In addition to the previously argued question, the Court requested that the parties brief and argue the additional question of whether the assistant principal violated the Fourth Amendment in opening T.L.O\u0027s purse. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court heard reargument on October 02, 1984.

Detective Peter O\u0027Malley prepared an affidavit listing the pieces of evidence he hoped to find at Sheppard\u0027s home. Since the local court was closed for the weekend and O\u0027Malley could not find a new warrant form, he filled out a previously used form instead. He took this form and the affidavit to the residence of the presiding judge and told him the form required revision and approval. The judge returned the form with his approval, but he did not list the pieces of evidence from the affidavit on the warrant. Police found items from the affidavit in Sheppard\u0027s home and charged him with first-degree murder. During Sheppard\u0027s trial, the judge stated that the warrant did not conform to Fourth Amendment standards because it did not describe the items to be seized. Because the police acted in good faith upon what they believed was a valid warrant, the judge admitted the items as evidence and Sheppard was convicted. On appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Sheppard successfully argued that the trial judge should have suppressed the evidence since no \"good-faith exception\" existed for admitting evidence obtained on a faulty warrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIf police officers mistakenly believe they have obtained a valid warrant, can a trial court use the evidence they obtained?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron White delivered the opinion for a 7-2 court. The Court maintained that trial courts can use evidence seized by officers who have an \"objectively reasonable basis\" for mistakenly believing they have obtained valid warrants. Upon a factual inquiry, the Court found that \"the officers in this case took every step that could reasonably be expected of them\" to secure a valid warrant.

Williams observed Richard McCarty’s vehicle weaving back and forth on Interstate Highway 270. He followed the car, pulled McCarty over, and asked him to exit the vehicle. Williams noticed that McCarty had trouble standing, and thus determined that he would charge McCarty with a traffic offense and that McCarty was no longer free to leave the scene. McCarty failed a balancing test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams then asked McCarty whether he had been using intoxicants, and McCarty responded that he had consumed two beers and smoked several joints of marijuana a short time before. Williams placed McCarty under arrest. At the county jail, however, a breathalyzer test did not detect any alcohol in McCarty’s system. Williams resumed questioning McCarty, asking him if he was under the influence of alcohol and whether the marijuana had been treated with any chemicals. Williams responded, “I guess, barely,” to the first question, but denied that the marijuana he smoked had been treated. At no point did Williams or any other officer tell McCarty that he had a right to remain silent, to consult with an attorney, or to have an attorney appointed for him if he could not afford one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarty was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, a first-degree misdemeanor under Ohio law punishable by fine or imprisonment for up to six months. McCarty moved to exclude the incriminating statements he made to Trooper Williams both on the scene of the arrest and in jail, on the grounds that he had not been informed of his constitutional rights prior to interrogation. The trial court denied the motion; McCarty pled ‘no contest’ and was found guilty. On appeal, the Franklin County Court of Appeals held that the Miranda rule does not apply to misdemeanors, relying on a prior decision by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed McCarty’s appeal for failing to present a substantial constitutional question. The District Court for the Southern District of Ohio dismissed McCarty’s writ of habeas corpus, but the United States Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit reversed. It held that Miranda warnings must be given to all individuals accused of misdemeanor traffic offenses prior to custodial interrogation, but did not clearly apply this rule to McCarty’s statements made at the scene of his arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did the highway patrol err in failing to give a Miranda warning to McCarty before he made incriminating statements at the station house?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the Ohio State Highway Patrol err in failing to give a Miranda warning to McCarty when he was detained pursuant to a routine traffic stop and under suspicion for the misdemeanor of driving under the influence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court held that arrestees in custody and under suspicion for a misdemeanor traffic offense must be informed of their constitutional rights or subsequent statements are inadmissible. Justice Marshall rejected Berkemer’s argument that the Court should carve out an exception to the Miranda rule for lesser offenses. He noted that the police are often unaware when they arrest a person whether that person has committed a felony or a misdemeanor, and that seemingly minor offenses sometimes escalate into more serious investigations. He reasoned that carving out an exception to the Miranda rule for misdemeanor traffic offenses would undermine Miranda’s simplicity and effectiveness given the rule’s widespread, customary use by police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Marshall then distinguished between the statements McCarty made at the scene of the arrest and at the jail. He held that McCarty was in custody as of the moment he was formally placed under arrest for driving under the influence, and that statements made after this point were inadmissible. He also held, however, that McCarty was not put in custody for purposes of the Miranda rule before this point. Justice Marshall reasoned that a routine traffic stop was more akin to a non-custodial ‘Terry stop’, and generally ended with a motorist’s release. He noted that McCarty was not told he could not leave prior to his arrest, and was only asked a few questions and told to perform a balancing test. Consequently, Justice Marshall held that the Ohio State Highway Patrol was not obligated to give Miranda warnings to persons detained pursuant to routine traffic stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred. He argued that the majority should have limited its decision to the question presented in Berkemer’s petition for certiorari: Whether law enforcement officers must give ‘Miranda warnings’ to individuals arrested for misdemeanor traffic offenses. He argued that the Court failed to follow the course of judicial restraint by answering a question not passed upon by the lower courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39909,"name":"R.

Leon was the target of police surveillance based on an anonymous informant\u0027s tip. The police applied to a judge for a search warrant of Leon\u0027s home based on the evidence from their surveillance. A judge issued the warrant and the police recovered large quantities of illegal drugs. Leon was indicted for violating federal drug laws. A judge concluded that the affidavit for the search warrant was insufficient; it did not establish the probable cause necessary to issue the warrant. Thus, the evidence obtained under the warrant could not be introduced at Leon\u0027s trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs there a \"good faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, there is such an exception. The justices held that evidence seized on the basis of a mistakenly issued search warrant could be introduced at trial. The exclusionary rule, argued the majority, is not a right but a remedy justified by its ability to deter illegal police conduct. In Leon, the costs of the exclusionary rule outweighed the benefits. The exclusionary rule is costly to society: Guilty defendants go unpunished and people lose respect for the law. The benefits of the exclusionary rule are uncertain: The rule cannot deter police in a case like Leon, where they act in good faith on a warrant issued by a judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39761,"name":"Rex E.

During that year, Fred Engle acquired two oil and gas leases covering a total of 240 acres in Wyoming. The Engles claimed a percentage depletion deduction on advance royalties from the oil and gas leases, but the Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected their claim because the deduction was not based on average daily production from the property’s oil and gas leases, as required by the Commissioner’s interpretation of 26 U.S.C. § 613A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner’s determination, with one dissent. The United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, reversed, holding that § 613A authorized depletion allowances on advance royalties so long as there was eventual production from the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso in 1975, the families of Philip D. Farmar and A. A. Sugg, joint owners of 46,515 acres of land in Irion County, Texas, leased their oil and gas interests to various lessees. Under these leases, the Farmars and Suggs received royalties and annual cash bonuses from the lessees. The bonuses were payable even when the property produced no oil or gas. The Farmars and Suggs claimed percentage depletion deductions on both the royalties and bonuses, but the Commissioner disallowed the deductions on the royalties because they were not based on average daily production from the property. In a consolidated suit, the Court of Claims held that Congress only allowed for depletion deductions from actual production during the taxable year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e In the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, Congress eliminated percentage depletion deductions for major oil producers. § 613A(d), however, authorized any qualified independent gas or oil producer or royalty owner to compute the allowance for percentage depletion in accordance with gross income from the property. The act stipulated that the allowance was tied to the taxpayer’s average daily production so as not to exceed the taxpayer’s depletable quantity. The Farmars and Suggs and the Commissioner filed petitions for writs of certiorari; the Supreme Court of the United States granted their petitions and consolidated their cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid 26 U.S.C. § 613A of the Internal Revenue Code authorize percentage depletion deductions on advance royalties and bonuses from oil and gas leases for independent producers?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the Court held that the act allowed independent lessors to claim percentage depletion deductions on advance royalties from oil and gas leases. Justice O’Connor first described the history of percentage depletion deductions from oil and gas income, noting that prior to 1975, the Commissioner allowed such deductions on any advance royalty or bonus whether there was current production of the underlying minerals or not. These deductions only had to be attributed to actual production during the life of the lease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile acknowledging that the Commissioner’s interpretation was plausible given the language of the act, Justice O’Connor argued that Congress eliminated the percentage deductions for large producers to subsidize the combined efforts of small producers and royalty owners in the exploration and production of the nation’s oil and gas resources. Under the Commissioner’s interpretation of § 613A, however, lessors and lessees would devote fewer resources to development of the nation’s energy resources. Justice O’Connor also looked to the legislative history of the act, noting that a complete repeal of the percentage deduction was never suggested during committee consideration of the act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Justice O’Connor held that the Commissioner’s interpretation of the act was unreasonable. She wrote that holders of interests in oil and gas deposits had been consistently entitled to percentage deductions for the past fifty years. She noted that the Commissioner’s interpretation denied percentage deductions to all parties when congress clearly intended to grant them to at least some parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry Blackmun dissented, joined by Justice William Brennan, Justice Byron White and Justice Thurgood Marshall. He emphasized that the Commissioner’s interpretation was consistent with the language of the statute, and that the act specifically tied the calculation of percentage deductions to average daily production during a given taxable year. Justice Blackmun disagreed that congressional silence on the availability of percentage deductions was dispositive.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35618,"name":"Marvin K.

The C.C.N.V. demonstration was intended to represent the plight of the homeless, and the demonstrators wished to sleep in tent cities set up in the park.

The Court noted that expression is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, and that the manner of the protest was at odds with the government\u0027s interest in maintaining the condition of the parks. The Court argued that the Park Service did not attempt to ban all sleeping in public parks (only in certain areas), and that the protesters had alternative means of communicating their message.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37751,"name":"Paul M.

As a result, Amber suffered from a neurogenic bladder, which required the use of a catheter every three or four hours each day to avoid kidney injury. The preferred method of catheterization was called clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). Amber was unable to perform this method herself because of her age, but a layperson could easily learn to perform the procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1979, Irving Independent School District agreed to provide special education for Amber as required by the federal Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA). This law required Texas to provide handicapped children with a free public education including ‘related services’. It only required ‘medical services’ for purposes of diagnosis or evaluation. Amber’s individualized education program provided that she would attend early childhood development classes and receive physical and occupational therapy. Her program, however, made no provision for school personnel to administer CIC. The Tatros unsuccessfully pursued administrative remedies to secure CIC services during school hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn October 1979, the Tatros filed an action against the district, the Texas State Board of Education, and others. They sought an injunction requiring the district to provide Amber with CIC. They also sought damages and attorneys’ fees through the Rehabilitation Act (RA), which forbade programs receiving federal aid from excluding handicapped people from participation and allowed prevailing parties to recover attorneys’ fees. The district court denied the Tatros\u0027 request for a preliminary injunction, concluding that CIC was not a ‘related service’ under the EHA because it did not arise from an effort to educate. The United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that CIC was indeed a ‘related service’ under the EHA, and remanded the case to the district court. The district court then ruled that CIC was not a ‘medical service’ under the EHA because a doctor was not needed to administer the procedure. It found that CIC was a ‘related service’ and ordered the defendants to modify Amber’s individualized education program accordingly. It also held that the Tatros had proved a violation of the RA. The Fifth Circuit affirmed both holdings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the provision of CIC for a student with a neurogenic bladder a required ‘related service’ under the Education of the Handicapped Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, could the Tatros seek attorneys’ fees through the Rehabilitation Act although other relief was available under the EHA?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. In a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Court held that the provision of CIC was a ‘related service’ and not a ‘medical service’ under the Education of the Handicapped Act. He looked to the text of the EHA, which defined ‘related service’ as that which is required for a handicapped child to benefit from special education. Chief Justice Burger noted that Amber would not be able to attend school and benefit from special education without CIC. He cited the Court’s previous holdings on the act, where it determined that congress intended to give handicapped children meaningful access to public education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Burger held that CIC was not a ‘medical service’ under the EHA. He deferred to the regulations of the Department of Education, which defined ‘medical services’ as those provided by a licensed physician. As CIC could be performed by a layperson and was required for Amber to attend school, it fell within both Congress’ and the Department of Education’s definitions of ‘related services’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Burger also held that the Tatros were not entitled to relief under the Rehabilitation Act because relief was available under the EHA. Hence, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit’s holding that the Tatros were entitled to attorneys’ fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Brennan concurred in part, but dissented from the majority’s holding on the awarding of attorneys’ fees under the Rehabilitation Act. He referred to his dissent in \u003ci\u003eSmith v. Robinson\u003c/i\u003e, where he similarly objected to that majority’s interpretation of a conflict between the EHA and the RA as an implicit repeal of parties’ right to seek attorneys’ fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stevens concurred in part but also dissented to the majority’s holding on the awarding of attorneys’ fees.

In 1980, Murphy pleaded guilty to false imprisonment in an unrelated criminal sexual conduct case and was sentenced to a 16-month suspended prison sentence and three years probation.  During probation, Murphy was required to participate in a treatment program for sex offenders at Alpha House and to see a probation officer.  While at Alpha House, Murphy admitted to the 1974 rape and murder.  An Alpha House counselor contacted Murphy’s probation officer about the admission and the officer called Murphy in for a meeting.  During the meeting Murphy became angry and said he “felt like calling a lawyer” but still admitted to the rape and murder.  The probation officer relayed the information from the meeting to the police, and Murphy was arrested and charged with first-degree murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Murphy tried to suppress testimony about the confession, arguing that it was obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court found that Murphy was not in custody at the time of the confession, and the confession was not compelled or involuntary.  The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the confession violated the Fifth Amendment because Murphy’s parole officer knew that Murphy’s answers were likely to be incriminating.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fifth Amendment require suppression of a probationer\u0027s incriminating admissions where the probationer is required to meet with his probation officer and to be truthful, and the probation officer has reason to believe that the probationer\u0027s answers to her questions are likely to be incriminating?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that admissions made to a probation officer about a crime unrelated to the probation are admissible in subsequent prosecution.  A state may require a probationer to meet with his officer and discuss matters that may affect his probationary status, but this does not create an exception to the rule that one must assert the privilege against self-incrimination.  Murphy could have asserted that privilege when his officer asked the questions that led to the incriminating answers, but he failed to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented, arguing that the state should have to prove that Murphy knew his rights and knowingly waived them.  The facts of this case did not warrant application of the principle that one waive their privilege against self-incrimination unless they asserted it in a timely fashion.  Justice John Paul Stevens, and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21501,"name":"David A.

The College did, however, enroll a large number of students who received Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOG\u0027s) through a Department of Education-run program. The DOE concluded that this assistance to students qualified the College as a recipient of federal assistance and made it subject to the nondiscrimination requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. When the College refused to comply with the requirements, the DOE attempted to terminate assistance to the student financial aid program. The College challenged the DOE\u0027s actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Grove City College subject to federal requirements because its students received federal grants? Did the provisions of Title IX violate the First Amendments rights of the College?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that there was no \"substantive difference\" between institutional assistance and aid received by a school through its students; Title IX coverage, the Court found, was triggered by the BEOG\u0027s. The Court noted that the assistance did not trigger institutionwide coverage under the Amendments, however. Only the College\u0027s financial aid program was subject to the federal requirements. The Court concluded that prohibiting discrimination as a condition for federal assistance did not infringe upon the First Amendment rights of the College and that the school was free to end its participation in the grant program.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37751,"name":"Paul M.

Each agreed to an Intoxilyzer test (commonly known as a “breathalyzer test”) that registered a blood-alcohol level (BAL) substantially higher than .10, the legal BAL limit in California. Each was charged with drunk driving. Before trial, each defendant motioned to exclude the breathalyzer test results from evidence by arguing that the police had failed to preserve breath samples from the time of the stop. All of their motions to exclude were denied. Two of the defendants were tried and convicted by the municipal court of Sonoma County; the remaining two had not yet gone to trial. All defendants appealed to the California Court of Appeals of the First District, Division Four, which granted the convicted respondents a new trial and ordered that the test results be excluded from all the trials. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require law enforcement agencies to preserve breath samples of suspected drunk drivers so that results of breath analysis tests may be used at trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that due process rights do not extend to the point of compelling law enforcement to preserve evidence on behalf of criminal defendants. The state’s duty to preserve evidence is limited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect’s defense. Such evidence must possess an apparent exculpatory value before it is destroyed, and it must be of such a nature that the defendant could not obtain comparable evidence by other reasonable means. States are also prohibited of not taking breath samples did not violate the Due Process Clause because the breathalyzer tests were reliable and the exculpatory value of breath samples was very low. Additionally, defendants could have used alternate means to disprove the test results.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19331,"name":"Charles R.B.

The package was an ordinary-looking cardboard box wrapped in brown paper. Inside, they found a tube that contained four plastic bags inside one another, and the innermost bag contained a white substance. They notified the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and replaced the contents of the box. When the DEA agents arrived, they removed a small amount of the white powder to conduct a field test that determined the powder was cocaine. The DEA agents obtained a warrant for the address on the package and searched the location, where they arrested Bradley Thomas Jacobsen and Donna Marie Jacobsen for possession of an illegal substance with intent to distribute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they were indicted, the respondents filed a motion to suppress the evidence on the grounds that the warrant was the product of an illegal search. The motion was denied, and the defendants were tried and convicted in district court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the decision and held that the warrant was the product of the test of the powder, for which a warrant was required. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment prohibit the warrantless testing of the suspicious powder?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the decision of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that the initial inspection by the DEA agent did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it remained within the scope of the previous search conducted by private agents. Once the agents gained enough information about the package to believe it contained contraband, the warrantless seizure of the package and its contents was not unreasonable. The Court also held that the test did not compromise any legitimate privacy interest. Either the test would be positive, which meant that the respondents had no legal right to posses the substance, or the test would be negative, which meant the agents knew nothing more about the powder than they knew after the visual examination. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice Byron R. White concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He argued that the Court unnecessarily dwelled on the fact that the DEA agent’s initial inspection of the contraband was allowed by the Fourth Amendment. Since the Court of Appeals agreed that the evidence was in plain view when the agents arrived, there was no reason for the Court to consider the issue. He also disagreed with the Court’s analysis and argued that the government cannot duplicate a private search without a warrant. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent where he argued that the condition in which the DEA agents found the contents of the box was not clear enough to make a ruling. If the contents of the box were in plain view, the agents did not need a warrant, but if the contents were not, the agents required a warrant to replicate the private search. He also argued that the Court erred by not taking into account the context in which agents find an item as evidence of an expectation of privacy that the search violates. In this case, the packaging clearly indicated that the substance was illegal. Therefore the respondents had no expectation of privacy, and the search was legal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36467,"name":"Mark W.

He was convicted of robbery and sentenced to life in prison, but his conviction was set aside due to a faulty indictment. At the first trial, Wiggins waived his right to counsel. On April 16, 1973, about two months before his second trial was set to begin, Wiggins filed a request for counsel and rescinded his earlier waiver. His feelings toward his standby counsel remained volatile throughout the trial. Wiggins was convicted in his second trial. He moved for a new trial and argued that his standby counsel interfered with his defense, but the court denied the motion. After he exhausted direct appellate and state habeas relief, Wiggins petitioned for federal habeas relief in district court. The district court denied his petition, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the presence of standby counsel violate a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to represent himself?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee the right to self-representation completely free from the presence of standby counsel. Rather, the Sixth Amendment protects the defendant’s right to “control the organization and content of his own defense.” The Court held that Wiggins was afforded all appropriate rights and that the presence of standby counsel did not interfere with the exercise of these rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun concurred in the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the Sixth Amendment protected a defendant’s right to present his case entirely without the mediation of a court-appointed attorney. Although Wiggins’ standby counsel was appointed in a purely advisory capacity, the attorneys regularly intervened and could have undermined Wiggins’ defense strategy. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34158,"name":"Leslie A.

The display included such objects as a Santa Claus house, a Christmas tree, a banner reading \"Seasons Greetings,\" and a nativity scene. The creche had been included in the display for over 40 years. Daniel Donnelly objected to the display and took action against Dennis Lynch, the Mayor of Pawtucket.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the inclusion of a nativity scene in the city\u0027s display violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that notwithstanding the religious significance of the creche, the city had not violated the Establishment Clause. The Court found that the display, viewed in the context of the holiday season, was not a purposeful or surreptitious effort to advocate a particular religious message. The Court found that the display merely depicted the historical origins of the Holiday and had \"legitimate secular purposes.\" The Court held that the symbols posed no danger of establishing a state church and that it was \"far too late in the day to impose a crabbed reading of the [Establishment] Clause on the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45459,"name":"William F.

While detained, Martin lied to the police about his address.  He was held overnight. At his initial appearance in court, the prosecution cited the gun, the lie about his address, and his evident lack of supervision as reasons why he should remain in detention until his fact-finding hearing. The court granted the detention under the New York Family Court Act (FCA). Fellow appellees Luis Rosario and Kenneth Morgan were also detained prior to their fact-finding hearings. Both were fourteen at the time, and had other delinquency petitions pending when they appeared before the court. While held in pretrial detention, Martin began a habeas corpus class action, which Rosario, Morgan, and 31 others joined, against the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Juvenile Justice. Martin argued that the pretrial detention amounted to punishment before a determination of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found that the pretrial detention was a violation of habeas corpus. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision and determined that the FCA was unconstitutional because it allowed detention of juveniles to serve as a punishment before the trial occurred. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the pretrial detention of a juvenile delinquent a violation of the right to Due Process as guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment if there is a “serious risk” that the juvenile will “commit an act which if committed by an adult would constitute a crime”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for a 6-3 majority, held that pretrial detention of juveniles does not violate the right of Due Process. The pretrial detention serves the legitimate purpose of protecting both the state and the juvenile from further crimes. Since the state has more responsibilities in the case of a juvenile than in the case of an adult, the pretrial detention not only protects society from potential crime, but it also protects the juvenile from the potential physical and psychological harm that can happen in the commission of a crime. The Court also found that the FCA put in place enough procedural safeguards that the juveniles are not denied Due Process. They are afforded notice, a hearing, and a statement of facts before any detention takes place, as well as an additional hearing to determine probable cause if the fact-finding hearing is not scheduled within three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented and wrote that the standard of “serious risk” was too vague and easily satisfied given the limited information in the possession of the judge or the juvenile’s lawyer at the time of the initial hearing. Additionally, the conditions of juvenile detention centers are often such that the psychological harms of subjecting a juvenile who has not been found guilty to that environment far outweigh the abstract benefits to society. Given the near-impossibility of predicting whether or not a juvenile will commit a crime in the near future, Justice Marshall found that drastic measures such as pretrial detention could not be justified and represented a violation of Due Process. Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35904,"name":"Martin Guggenheim","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/martin_guggenheim","view_count":0,"last_name":"Guggenheim","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"martin_guggenheim"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/13137"},{"advocate":{"ID":30409,"name":"Judith A.

Marty Ingels, her husband, was also a professional entertainer. On October 9, 1979, the National Enquirer published an article about Jones. John South wrote the first draft of the article, and his byline appeared on it. Shortly before publication, South called Ingels to read him the article and elicit his comments on it. Ian Calder, the president and editor of the Enquirer, declined to print a retraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNational Enquirer, Inc. was a corporation that published a national newspaper with a total circulation of over five million, 600,000 copies of which were sold in California. John South was a reporter for the Enquirer. He was a resident of Florida, but frequently travelled to California on business. Ian Calder was a Florida resident and he exerted close control over the functions of the Enquirer; he had traveled to California only twice and had no other relevant contacts with that state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones filed an action in California state court against Calder and South, alleging that the article was untrue, libelous, and that it damaged their reputations and good names. The superior court ruled that although the injury occurred in California, it lacked personal jurisdiction over the claim because of the potential chilling effect from requiring editors and reporters to appear in remote jurisdictions. The California Court of Appeals reversed because the defendants intended to cause tortious injury to Jones and Ingels in California. A timely petition for appeal to the Supreme Court of California was denied, but the Supreme Court of the United States treated it as a petition for a writ of certiorari, granting review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Calder and South have sufficient contacts with the state of California to give California state courts personal jurisdiction over Jones’ claim of libel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice William Rehnquist, the Court held that Calder\u0027s and South’s contacts with California were sufficiently strong to give California state courts jurisdiction over Jones’ libel claim. Justice Rehnquist wrote that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only permits personal jurisdiction when a defendant has certain minimum contacts with a state such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking to the facts of Jones’ claim, Justice Rehnquist emphasized that the allegedly libelous story concerned the California activities of a California resident, and that Jones’ television career was based in California. In addition, the alleged injury to Jones’ career was suffered in California. Thus, jurisdiction was proper because of the effects of Calder and South’s Florida activities in California. Unlike a welder who helps create a boiler in one state that is sold in another state and that subsequently malfunctions, Calder and South allegedly intentionally directed their actions at California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Rehnquist noted that courts must evaluate each defendants’ contacts with a given state to determine if they’re sufficient, even if defendants work for the same organization. He rejected Calder and South’s argument that extending jurisdiction over writers and editors in remote states would have a chilling effect on speech; First Amendment concerns about that effect are already taken into account in the constitutional limits on the substantive law of libel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31320,"name":"John G.

Cronic, along with Carolyn Cummings and Wylie C. Merritt, participated in a mail fraud that involved transferring more than $9,400,000 in checks between a bank in Tampa, FL, and one in Norman, OK. The three were indicted on mail fraud charges. Shortly before trial, Cronic’s counsel withdrew and the court appointed a lawyer for him. The court appointed a lawyer who specialized in real estate law and only had 25 days to prepare for the trial, compared to the government’s almost five years. Cummings and Merritt agreed to testify for the government. The jury found Cronic guilty and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court of Appeals concluded that Cronic’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel had been violated and reversed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e Must there be proof of specific errors on the part of counsel in order to show a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the Court of Appeals erred by inferring that the less-than-ideal circumstances leading up to the trial negatively influenced the lawyer’s performance. The Sixth Amendment protects the right for an accused to receive effective assistance of counsel in order to protect the adversary process. Therefore, the test to determine whether a violation of the Sixth Amendment occurred must rely on evidence that the adversary process itself suffered. In this case, there was no evidence of specific instances of failure of counsel during trial. Also, the circumstances prior to the trial were not such that effective assistance would have been impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice Thurgood Marshall concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

Oliver\u0027s farm, acting on reports that marijuana was grown there. A gate marked with a \"No Trespassing\" sign surrounded the field. Police found marijuana in the field about a mile from Oliver\u0027s home. Before trial, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky suppressed evidence found in the search on the ground that Oliver had a reasonable expectation that his field would remain private. This expectation triggered the Fourth Amendment\u0027s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed under the open field doctrine. The open field doctrine states that a citizen\u0027s protection from unwarranted search does not extend to open fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second case, police searched the woods behind Richard Thornton\u0027s property after an anonymous tip. Police found two marijuana patches on Thornton\u0027s land. The Maine Superior Court granted Thornton\u0027s motion to suppress evidence found in the search for the same reasons as the Oliver case. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court of Main affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the open field doctrine apply when police officers knowingly enter privately owned fields without a warrant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 vote, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote for the majority, stating that the open field doctrine applies to both cases. Individuals cannot legitimately expect privacy for activities conducted out in the open except in the area immediately surrounding their house. Also, the act of police officers entering a privately owned field is not automatically a search for Fourth Amendment purposes even if it is a common law trespass. Oliver\u0027s case was affirmed, and Thornton\u0027s was reversed and remanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White wrote a special concurrence, saying that there was no need for the majority to deal with the expectation of privacy issue because a field is clearly not a \"house\" or an \"effect\" under the Fourth Amendment. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent, contending that the law should protect private land that is marked as such against unreasonable searches and seizures. Justice William J. Brennan and Justice John P. Stevens joined Justice Marshall\u0027s dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21738,"name":"Donna L.

Gladys Pulliam, the state magistrate for Culpeper County, Virginia set bail at $250 and, when Allen was unable to make bail, Pulliam committed him to the Culpeper County Jail for 14 days.  Allen was tried, found guilty, fined, and released. The trial judge reopened his case and reversed the judgment. Allen sued Pulliam in district court and sought declaratory and injunctive relief for incarcerating him while waiting for trial on non-jailable offenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesse Nicholson was arrested four times in a two-month period for public intoxication, a Class 4 misdemeanor for which the maximum penalty is a $100 fine. Like Allen, Nicholson was incarcerated for failure to make bail, and he intervened in Allen’s suit as a party plaintiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis district court held that Pulliam’s practice of incarcerating persons for not making bail on non-jailable offenses violated their rights to due process and equal protection. The district court enjoined the practice and found Allen and Nicholson entitled to costs, including attorneys’ fees. Pulliam appealed the finding regarding costs and argued that, as a judicial officer, she was granted judicial immunity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the judicial immunity argument and affirmed the district court’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes judicial immunity protect a member of the judiciary acting in her official capacity from paying attorneys’ fees in a civil suit? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the precedent set by British common law relied on the issuance of writs, rather than the imposition of judicial immunity, to protect judicial independence. The United States never had a doctrine of judicial immunity from prospective relief, and there was no evidence that the lack of that protection created a chilling effect on judicial independence. The Court held that there was no reason to assume such immunity was necessary. There was no legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to insulate judges from injunctive relief.  The Civil Rights Acts and their interpretations illustrate that Congress intended all state actors to be subject to such remedies to ensure the protection of Fourteenth Amendment rights. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a dissent where he argued that judicial immunity from all types of relief and damages in civil suits is essential to protect judicial independence. He wrote that the majority’s opinion misinterprets British common law, which does rely on judicial immunity to protect judges from suit arising from a judge acting in her official capacity. He argued that the potential for the awarding of attorneys’ fees greatly increases the risk of harassing litigation because attorneys will recommend such action to clients. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25040,"name":"Gerald L.

Central Jail did not allow inmates to have contact visits with spouses, children, or other guests. Central Jail also prohibited inmates from watching the irregularly-scheduled shakedown searches of their own cells. Respondents sued in district court and argued that these practices violated their civil rights under Section 1983 of the United States Code. The district court agreed with respondents\u0027 claim that an inmate\u0027s right to embrace his family is \"a matter of great importance\" and outweighs the minimal risks the contact visits posed. The district court held that low-risk detainees should be allowed contact visits if they are incarcerated for more than a month. The district court also held that inmates should be allowed to watch searches of their cells from a distance because the shakedowns often resulted in prison officials removing or destroying the inmates\u0027 personal property. The jail officials appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u0027s ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the Los Angeles County Central Jail\u0027s practice of prohibiting detainees from having contact visits and from being present while their cells were searched reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that Central Jail\u0027s policies worked to further the government\u0027s reasonable and legitimate interest in ensuring the safety of jail officials and visitors. The Court cited the extensive precedent that gave discretion to prison officials in enacting policies and procedures that they deem necessary to preserve internal order and security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun authored an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he agreed with the approval of Central Jail\u0027s policies but disagreed with the majority\u0027s willingness to grant judicial deference to jail officials rather than to perform a careful analysis of the inmates\u0027 constitutional claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall authored a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the jail officials could not show that allowing low-risk inmates to see their family would \"frustrate the achievement of any substantial state interest.\" Furthermore, Justice Marshall cautioned against the Court\u0027s quick deference to the \"expertise\" of prison administrators and their blanket acceptance of \"established state procedure[s],\" at the cost of the depriving inmates of their private property.

First, a state agency determines if a claimant has a disability and when the condition began or ended. Second, state agencies\u0027 disability determinations can be reviewed upon the claimant\u0027s request. Third, if upon review the claimant suffers an adverse finding he or she may demand an evidentiary hearing by an administrative law judge. Fourth, if a claimant is dissatisfied with the administrative law judge\u0027s decision, they may appeal to the Appeals Council of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Claiming delays in excess of 90 days, during steps two and three, Leon Day sued on behalf of several similarly aggrieved Vermont claimants alleging a violation of the \"reasonable time\" hearing limitation. On appeal from the Second Circuit Court of Appeal\u0027s ruling upholding a district court\u0027s imposition of disability hearing deadlines, the Supreme Court granted HHS Secretary Margaret Heckler certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the judiciary\u0027s imposition of deadlines by which disability claims must be processed constitute an unconstitutional interference with a legislatively mandated statute?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 opinion, the Court held that Congress already considered and expressly rejected the imposition of mandatory disability dispute-resolution deadlines. Such deadlines, according to congressional reports, would subordinate quality of service to timeliness. The Court cautioned that pervasively regulated areas, such as the Social Security Act in general and its dispute resolution mechanisms in particular, should be left free of judicial intervention that is far less attuned to the needs of the constituencies served by such legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39915,"name":"Richard H.

(Hustler) and several other defendants for libel in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Keeton alleged that the district court had jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship since she was a resident of New York and Hustler was an Ohio corporation with its principal place of business in California. Hustler sold 10 to 15 thousand copies of its magazine in New Hampshire each month but Keeton\u0027s only connection to New Hampshire was the circulation there of copies of a magazine that she assisted in producing. She chose to sue in New Hampshire because it was the only state in which the statute of limitation for libel six years, the longest in the United States had not run. The district court dismissed the suit on the ground that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbade the application of New Hampshire\u0027s long-arm statute in order to acquire personal jurisdiction over Hustler. The First Circuit affirmed, finding that Keeton\u0027s contacts with New Hampshire were too attenuated for an assertion of personal jurisdiction over Hustler. The Court of Appeals also found the application of the \"single publication rule,\" which would require the court to award Keeton damages caused in all states should she prevail, unfair since most of Keeton\u0027s alleged injuries occurred outside of New Hampshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Hustler\u0027s circulation of magazines within the forum state of New Hampshire alone sufficient, without regard to the depth of plaintiff\u0027s contacts or the amount of plaintiff\u0027s damages caused in New Hampshire, to support an assertion of personal jurisdiction in a libel action based upon the contents of the magazine?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Hustler\u0027s regular circulation of magazines in New Hampshire is sufficient to support an assertion of personal jurisdiction in a libel action based on the contents of the magazine. In analyzing whether there are sufficient minimum contacts to permit personal jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment, a court should focus on the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation. Hustler has continuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market and therefore it must reasonably anticipate being hauled into court there. Keeton did not need to have minimum contacts with the forum state in order for that state to have asserted personal jurisdiction over Hustler. New Hampshire had a sufficient interest in adjudicating the dispute. Moreover, even though most of the harm done to Keeton occurred outside New Hampshire, the same would be true in most libel cases brought anywhere other than plaintiff\u0027s state of domicile.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42002,"name":"Stephen M.

(Stauffer) in Tennessee. Before granting entry, Stauffer requested that the employees of the private firm sign an agreement promising not to disclose any trade secrets they might learn during the inspection. The employees refused, and Stauffer denied them entry. The EPA and private firm returned with a warrant to enter the premises, but Stauffer again denied them entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EPA began a civil contempt proceeding against Stauffer to gain entry. The district court ruled in favor of the EPA and Stauffer appealed. On appeal, Stauffer argued that the employees of the private firm did not qualify as “authorized representatives” under the Clean Air Act, and therefore Stauffer was not required to grant them entry. Stauffer had used this argument before in a similar case from Wyoming, which involved the same parties. Stauffer argued that this previous case precluded the government from re-litigating this issue. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with Stauffer and reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state court’s ruling in a prior case that involved the same party, issue of law, and nearly identical fact scenario prevent the government from re-litigating that issue in a different venue?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the unanimous opinion in which the Court held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied in this case. This doctrine prevents re-litigation of issues that were “conclusively determined in a prior action involving the same parties.” While, the government conceded that the facts and question in this case were the same as those already ruled upon in the Wyoming case, it argued that this case could proceed because it involved unrelated subject matter. Additionally, the government argued that it had a duty to re-litigate issues of public importance. The Court found these arguments unpersuasive and concluded that this case involved the same parties, issues of law, and virtually identical fact scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a concurring opinion in which he warned of taking the doctrine of collateral estoppel too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34216,"name":"Louis F.

The Code also prohibits individuals from making tax-deductible donations to private schools which racially discriminate. Inez Wright and others filed a nationwide class action suit arguing that the IRS had not fulfilled its obligations in enforcing these provisions of the Code, and thus, that government was subsidizing and encouraging the expansion of segregated education in private schools. This case was decided together with Reagan v. Wright.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the IRS shirk its enforcement duties and encourage private schools to racially discriminate, thus, harming desegregation efforts in the nation\u0027s public schools?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that the circumstances involved in this case did not warrant federal-court adjudication. Justice O\u0027Connor\u0027s opinion argued that the Court could not act since the injuries that the suit identified were not \"judicially cognizable\" and because they were not \"fairly traceable to the assertedly unlawful conduct of the IRS.\" Citing past precedents, O\u0027Connor found that, by itself, an assertion that the government is not acting in the bounds of the law is not enough to bring a suit to a federal court. To allow so would open the door to a myriad of legal challenges in which the courts would become buried by the minutiae of governing, acting as \"continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39717,"name":"Robert H.
