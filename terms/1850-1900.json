Ships that failed to do so were subject to a fine. Cooley was a ship owner who refused to hire a local pilot and also refused to pay the fine. He argued that the law violated the Commerce Clause, which gives Congress authority over interstate commerce and bars Congress from delegating that authority to the states.

He used this money to purchase land in New Jersey. In accordance with an act passed in 1820, the Treasury Department issued a warrant of distress against Swartwout. This voided his purchase of land and provided for the seizure of the money he embezzled. Swartwout argued that the 1820 Act violated the Fifth Amendment\u0027s guarantee of due process of law since it authorized a non-judicial procedure to remove property. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in order to resolve conflicting opinions of judges on the circuit court of the United States for the district of New Jersey.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the federal government violate the due process of law guarantee of the Fifth Amendment by recovering funds embezzled from it through nonjudicial procedures?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Benjamin R. Curtis delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. The Court found that \"due process of law\" meant that all citizens be tried \"by the law of the land,\" a concept established by the Magna Carta. When issuing the warrant, the Treasury Department properly applied the 1820 Act, which was part of the \"law of the land.\" Since the \"constitution contains no description of those processes which it [the due process clause] was intended to allow or forbid,\" the Court examined traditions of common law to find whether nonjudicial warrants had a precedential basis. It found that they did, and did not find a constitutional provision prohibiting their use. Therefore, the Court concluded the Act conformed with the federal government\u0027s \"power to collect and disburse revenue,\" which \"includes all known and appropriate means of effectually collecting and disbursing that revenue.\" If a recipient disputes the sum he owes, he may rely upon his procedural right to petition a district court to consider \"whether he is indebted as recited in the warrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"59","page":"272","year":"1856","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27158"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15216,"name":"Taney Court (1853-1857)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/taney16","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15054,"name":"Roger B.

From 1833 to 1843, he resided in Illinois (a free state) and in the Louisiana Territory, where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. After returning to Missouri, Scott filed suit in Missouri court for his freedom, claiming that his residence in free territory made him a free man. After losing, Scott brought a new suit in federal court. Scott\u0027s master maintained that no “negro” or descendant of slaves could be a citizen in the sense of Article III of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Dred Scott free or a slave?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe majority held that “a negro, whose ancestors were imported into [the U.S.], and sold as slaves,” whether enslaved or free, could not be an American citizen and therefore did not have standing to sue in federal court. Because the Court lacked jurisdiction, Taney dismissed the case on procedural grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaney further held that the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was unconstitutional and foreclose Congress from freeing slaves within Federal territories. The opinion showed deference to the Missouri courts, which held that moving to a free state did not render Scott emancipated. Finally, Taney ruled that slaves were property under the Fifth Amendment, and that any law that would deprive a slave owner of that property was unconstitutional. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dissent, Benjamin Robbins Curtis criticized Taney for addressing the claim’s substance after finding the Court lacked jurisdiction. He pointed out that invalidating the Missouri Compromise was not necessary to resolve the case, and cast doubt on Taney’s position that the Founders categorically opposed anti-slavery laws. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn McLean echoed Curtis, finding the majority improperly reviewed the claim’s substance when its holding should have been limited to procedure. He also argued that men of African descent could be citizens because they already had the right to vote in five states. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35443,"name":"Montgomery Blair","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/montgomery_blair","view_count":0,"last_name":"Blair","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"montgomery_blair"},"advocate_description":"for Dred Scott","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21175"},{"advocate":{"ID":25127,"name":"George Ticknor Curtis","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/george_t_curtis","view_count":0,"last_name":"Curtis","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"george_t_curtis"},"advocate_description":"for Dred Scott","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21176"},{"advocate":{"ID":62560,"name":"Henry S.

Though the federal authorities did not accept the judge\u0027s order, a mob eventually freed Glover. Booth was charged with aiding the escape of a runaway slave in violation of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Via a writ of \u003cem\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/em\u003e, Booth successfully petitioned the Supreme Court of Wisconsin for his release. Booth was then convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Wisconsin and detained again. Booth again petitioned the Supreme Court of Wisconsin for his release, alleging that the Fugitive Slave Act was unconstitutional and that the Federal District Court lacked jurisdiction. Booth was again released by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Pursuant to the law, the Crescent City Live-stock Landing and Slaughter-House Company received a charter to run a slaughterhouse downstream from the city. No other areas around the city were permitted for slaughtering animals over the next 25 years, and existing slaughterhouses would be closed. A group of butchers argued that they would lose their right to practice their trade and earn a livelihood under the monopoly. Specifically, they argued the monopoly created involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, and abridged privileges or immunities, denied equal protection of the laws, and deprived them of liberty and property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the creation of the monopoly violate the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that the monopoly violated neither the Thirteenth or Fourteenth Amendments, reasoning that these amendments were passed with the narrow intent to grant full equality to former slaves. Thus, to the Court, the Fourteenth Amendment only banned the states from depriving blacks of equal rights; it did not guarantee that all citizens, regardless of race, should receive equal economic privileges by the state. Any rights guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause were limited to areas controlled by the federal government, such as access to ports and waterways, the right to run for federal office, and certain rights affecting safety on the seas. Moreover, the Court held that the butchers bringing suit were not deprived of their property without due process of law because they could still earn a legal living in the area by slaughtering on the Crescent City Company grounds. Thus, the Court concluded that the Louisiana law was constitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stephen Johnson Field’s dissent argued that the Fourteenth Amendment could not be construed as only protecting former slaves.

Reese and Foushee claimed Garner had failed to pay a tax of $1.50, but Garner had attempted to pay the tax and was refused by a tax collector. The Enforcement Act of 1870, which defined penalties associated with violations of voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment, stipulated that if an official refused to permit a citizen to perform an action required for voting, the citizen could present an affidavit that would qualify him. Reese and Foushee refused to accept Garner\u0027s affidavit. Reese and Foushee were charged with violating the Enforcement Act. On appeal, the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kentucky found the relevant sections of the Enforcement Act too broad, exceeding the bounds of the Fifteenth Amendment, and dismissed the indictments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the Enforcement Act of 1870 a valid exercise of Congress\u0027s power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-1 decision authored by Chief Justice Morrison Waite, the Court concluded that the relevant sections of the Enforcement Act lacked the necessary, limiting language to qualify as enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Chief Justice first stated that the Fifteenth Amendment \"does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one,\" but \"prevents the States, or the United States, however, from giving preference…to one citizen of the United States over another on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" In examining the language of the Enforcement Act, the Court noted that, while the first two sections of the act explicitly referred to race in criminalizing interference with the right to vote, the relevant third and fourth sections refer only to the \"aforesaid\" offense. According to the Court, this language does not sufficiently tailor the law to qualify as \"appropriate legislation\" under the Enforcement Clause of the Fifteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"92","page":"214","year":"1876","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27173"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15181,"name":"Waite Court (1874-1877)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/waite1","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15101,"name":"Morrison R.

The Society was chartered to run a lottery for the next 25 years; however, in 1868, a new constitution ratified by the people outlawed lotteries in the state. John Stone and others associated with the Society were arrested in 1874 for running a lottery. The Society claimed they were protected by the provisions of their charter while the state declared that the subsequent enforcement legislation had repealed the grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Mississippi violate the Contract Clause by repealing the Society\u0027s grant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA unanimous Court found that the Mississippi classification of lotteries as outlawed acts was valid. The State legislature do not have the power to bind the decisions of the people and future legislatures. The Court stated that no legislation had the authority to bargain away the public health and morals. The Court viewed the lottery as a vice that threatened the public health and morals. The contracts protected in the Constitution are property rights, not governmental rights. Therefore, one can only obtain temporary suspension of the governmental rights (in this case, the right to outlaw actions) in a charter which can be revoked by the will of the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"101","page":"814","year":"1880","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27177"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15192,"name":"Waite Court (1877-1880)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/waite3","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15101,"name":"Morrison R.

Though privately owned, these businesses were like public utilities, exercising public functions for the benefit of the public and, thus, subject to public regulation. In five separate cases, a black person was denied the same accommodations as a white person in violation of the 1875 Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Civil Rights Act of 1875 violate the 10th Amendment of the Constitution which reserves all powers not granted to the national government to the states or to the people?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eDifferentiating between state and private action, the majority ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not permit the federal government to prohibit discriminatory behavior by private parties. Thus, Sections 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were unconstitutional because they exceeded Congress\u0027s authority under the Fourteenth Amendment by purporting to regulate the conduct of private individuals. The Court held the Act likewise exceeded Congress’s authority under the Thirteenth Amendment, which bars involuntary servitude and is restricted to prohibiting ownership of slaves, not other forms of discriminatory conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan advocated for a broader interpretation of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. He pointed to the public function that these private places of accommodation serve. Harlan argued the line between state and private action is often blurred, such as how private railroads provide the government function of facilitating travel. He suggested that restrictions on the right to travel might violate the Thirteenth Amendment prohibition against involuntary servitude, and argued that the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may also be implicated. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41901,"name":"Samuel Field Phillips","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/samuel_f_phillips","view_count":0,"last_name":"Phillips","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"samuel_f_phillips"},"advocate_description":"Solicitor General, Department of Justice, for the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21339"},{"advocate":{"ID":46050,"name":"William M.

The Sioux tribal government convicted Crow Dog and, applying traditional Sioux law, ordered him to pay restitution to the victim\u0027s family. The government of the Dakota Territory also charged Crow Dog with murder, and, after being found guilty, Crow Dog was sentenced to death. Crow Dog appealed for a writ of \u003cem\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/em\u003e, and argued that the federal court lacked jurisdiction, pointing to an 1834 act that specifically excluded crimes committed by one Native American on another from federal jurisdiction. The government argued that an 1868 treaty with the Sioux that required the tribe surrender criminals to United States superseded the earlier statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid federal law grant the Dakota Territory court jurisdiction over the murder for which Crow Dog was convicted?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 9-0 decision authored by Justice Stanley Matthews, the Court concluded that Congress had not granted federal courts jurisdiction over the murder of one Native American by another. The Court interpreted the 1868 treaty\u0027s stipulation that criminals be surrendered to the federal government in context, and, given that the treaty was made between two parties, \"the party of whites and their allies\" and \"tribe of Indians,\" concluded the provision did not conflict with or repeal the 1834 law. Justice Matthews\u0027 opinion goes on to note that, while the law is clearly conflicted on the question because the 1834 law was never expressly repealed, there was no \"positive repugnancy between the provisions of the new laws and those of the old\" that would entail an implied repeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"109","page":"556","year":"1883","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27180"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15191,"name":"Waite Court (1882-1887)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/waite11","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15101,"name":"Morrison R.

In 1883, eight Georgia men, including Dilmus, James, Jasper, and Neal Yarbrough, were charged under the Enforcement Act with intimidating Berry Saunders, an African-American, to prevent him from voting in the 1882 congressional election. The eight were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Following their conviction, the eight men filed petitions for writs of \u003cem\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/em\u003e on the ground that Congress had no authority to pass the Enforcement Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Congress have the authority to pass the Enforcement Act of 1870?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Samuel Freeman Miller, the Court concluded that the federal government \"must have the power to protect the elections on which its existence depends from violence and corruption.\" After noting that the implied powers of the Constitution are \"as much a part of the instrument as what is expressed,\" Justice Miller wrote that the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article I, Section 8, in conjunction with Article I, Section 4, which provides that \"Congress may at any time make or alter\" regulations regarding the \"times, places, and manner of holding elections,\" granted Congress the necessary authority to pass the Enforcement Act. Additionally, the Court found additional defense of Congress\u0027 authority in the enforcement provision of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court determined that \"this fifteenth article of amendment does…substantially confer on the negro the right to vote, and Congress has the power to protect and enforce that right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"110","page":"651","year":"1884","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27182"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15191,"name":"Waite Court (1882-1887)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/waite11","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15101,"name":"Morrison R.

The board had total discretion over who would be issued a permit. Although workers of Chinese descent operated 89 percent of the city\u0027s laundry businesses, not a single Chinese owner was granted a permit. Yick Wo and Wo Lee each operated laundry businesses without a permit and, after refusing to pay a $10 fine, were imprisoned by the city\u0027s sheriff, Peter Hopkins. Each sued for writ of \u003cem\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/em\u003e, arguing the fine and discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In June 1885, Kagama, a Native American, was tried for the murder of Iyouse, another Native American, on the Hoopa Valley reservation in California. At trial, Kagama challenged the court\u0027s jurisdiction over the matter, arguing that the relevant section of the Indian Appropriations Act was unconstitutional.

Describing Native Americans as \"wards of the nation,\" the Court concluded, \"From their very weakness and helplessness, so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal Government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised, there arises the duty of protection, and with it the power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"118","page":"375","year":"1886","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27185"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15191,"name":"Waite Court (1882-1887)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/waite11","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15101,"name":"Morrison R.

Southern Pacific refused to pay taxes on its fences and the difference account for by subtracting outstanding mortgages. Santa Clara County brought action against it in a state court. The county argued that since it could tax the land which situated the fences, it could also tax the additional value of the land added by the fences. Southern Pacific had the action moved to a federal district court, which ruled that the state did not have jurisdiction to tax fences. The county appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the California constitution allow the state to increase property taxes against railroad companies when the companies added additional value to the property by building fences? Did the state tax board wrongfully tax property without deducting for the outstanding mortgages against the property owners?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and Yes. Justice John Marshall Harlan delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. The state tax board tried to levy a single sum against the railway company which both wrongfully included the value of the fences and excluded a deduction for the outstanding mortgages. The state tax board increased taxes on the property based on a arbitrary measure of the value added by the fences. The state constitution required the state and its counties to separately assess the \"land, and improvements thereon\" before increasing taxes. A state statute specified fences as a form of land improvement.

Davis, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, was indicted for falsely swearing the oath prior to the 1888 election. Davis appealed his conviction via a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that requiring the oath violated his right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment.

It outlawed \"every contract, combination...or conspiracy, in restraint of trade\" or interstate commerce, and it declared every attempt to monopolize any part of trade or commerce to be illegal. The E.C.

In 1892, Homer Plessy – who was seven-eighths Caucasian – agreed to participate in a test to challenge the Act. He was solicited by the Comite des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens), a group of New Orleans residents who sought to repeal the Act. They asked Plessy, who was technically black under Louisiana law, to sit in a \"whites only\" car of a Louisiana train. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe railroad cooperated because it thought the Act imposed unnecessary costs via the purchase of additional railroad cars. When Plessy was told to vacate the whites-only car, he refused and was arrested. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Plessy’s lawyers argued that the Separate Car Act violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.

To accomplish this, the city petitioned in Cook County Circuit Court to have the necessary land condemned. The land was condemned. The individuals were awarded compensation, while the railroad was awarded just one dollar. The railroad appealed the judgment, alleging that the condemnation deprived it of its property in violation of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Chicago\u0027s condemnation of and compensation for Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad\u0027s land violate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 7-1 decision, the Court held that the Due Process clause required the states to award just compensation when taking private property for public use. While the Court warned of the danger of a government that did not have any restraints in exercising eminent domain, fair compensation could address that danger. Since the procedures specified in Illinois\u0027 general statutes were followed in this case, the railroad\u0027s Fourteenth Amendment rights were not violated. [This case marked the first time that the Court \u0027incorporated\u0027 a specific provision of the Bill of Rights – the \"just compensation\" requirement of the Fifth Amendment – through the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and applied that requirement to the states. This approach set the stage for further incorporation of other Bill of Rights provisions.]\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"166","page":"226","year":"1897","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27198"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[null],"decided_by":{"ID":15171,"name":"Fuller Court (1896-1897)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/fuller13","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15052,"name":"Melville W.

Moreover, by treaty no Chinese subject in the United States could become a naturalized citizen. Wong Kim Ark was born in San Francisco to parents who were both Chinese citizens who resided in the United States at the time. At age 21, he returned to China to visit his parents who had previously resided in the United States for 20 years. When he returned to the United States, Wong was denied entry on the ground that he was not a citizen.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a child who was born in the United States to Chinese-citizen parents who are lawful permanent residents of the United States a U.S. citizen under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eBecause Wong was born in the United States and his parents were not “employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China,” the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment automatically makes him a U.S. citizen. Justice Horace Gray authored the opinion on behalf of a 6-2 majority, in which the Court established the parameters of the concept known as jus soli—the citizenship of children born in the United States to non-citizens.
