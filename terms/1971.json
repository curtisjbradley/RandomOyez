In her lawsuit, Roe alleged that the state laws were unconstitutionally vague and abridged her right of personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Constitution recognize a woman\u0027s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eInherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is a fundamental “right to privacy” that protects a pregnant woman’s choice whether to have an abortion. However, this right is balanced against the government’s interests in protecting women\u0027s health and protecting “the potentiality of human life.” The Texas law challenged in this case violated this right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 7-2 majority of the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the Court considered whether the case was moot, concluding that it was not. When the subject of litigation is “capable of repetition yet evading review,” a case need not be dismissed as moot. Pregnancy is a “classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects against state action the right to privacy, and a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion falls within that right to privacy. A state law that broadly prohibits abortion without respect to the stage of pregnancy or other interests violates that right. Although the state has legitimate interests in protecting the health of pregnant women and the “potentiality of human life,” the relative weight of each of these interests varies over the course of pregnancy, and the law must account for this variability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first trimester of pregnancy, the state may not regulate the abortion decision; only the pregnant woman and her attending physician can make that decision. In the second trimester, the state may impose regulations on abortion that are reasonably related to maternal health. In the third trimester, once the fetus reaches the point of “viability,” a state may regulate abortions or prohibit them entirely, so long as the laws contain exceptions for cases when abortion is necessary to save the life or health of the mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42232,"name":"Sarah R.

The Stanleys never married, but lived together off and on for 18 years.  When Joan died, the State of Illinois took the children.  Under Illinois law, unwed fathers were presumed unfit parents regardless of their actual fitness and their children became wards of the state.  Peter appealed the decision, arguing that the Illinois law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because unwed mothers were not deprived of their children without a showing that they were actually unfit parents.  The Illinois Supreme Court rejected Stanley’s Equal Protection claim, holding that his actual fitness as a parent was irrelevant because he and the children’s mother were unmarried.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Illinois statutory scheme that assumes unwed fathers are unfit parents violate the Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 5-2 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that it could consider the constitutionality of the Illinois law even though Peter might have regained custody of his children through adoption or guardianship proceedings.  The Illinois law violated the Due Process clause because an unwed father was stripped of his parental rights without a hearing.  Justice William O. Douglas joined in this part of the opinion.  A four justice plurality went on to write that the Illinois law also violated the Equal Protection Clause because it denied a fitness hearing to certain parents, while granting one to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented, arguing that the majority exceeded its authority by raising the Due Process issue when the lower court had not.  The Equal Protection question was the only one properly before the court, and it was not violated because the state was merely recognizing the legal relationships of fathers whether through marriage or adoption.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.  Justice Lewis F. Powell and Justice William H. Rehnquist did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38117,"name":"Patrick T.

The evidence indicated that the prosecution failed to disclose that it promised a key witness immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony against Giglio.  The district court denied Giglio’s motion for a new trial, finding that the error did not affect the verdict.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the prosecution’s failure to disclose a promise of immunity made to a key witness grounds for a new trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for a unanimous court, reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.  The Supreme Court held that evidence of the agreement was relevant to the witness’ credibility.  Because the new evidence affected the witness’ credibility and the prosecution’s case rested almost entirely on this witness’ testimony, the original trial violated due process and entitled Giglio to a new trial.

Previously, the United States twice allowed Mandel to temporarily visit the United States -- once as a working journalist in 1962 and once as a lecturer in 1968. Both times and without Mandel’s knowledge, the State Department found him ineligible, but the attorney general used his discretionary power under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to admit Mandel temporarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Graduate Student Association at Stanford University invited Mandel to the United States for six days to participate in a conference. On September 8, 1969, Mandel applied to the American Counsel in Brussels for a nonimmigrant visa to enter the United States. Other persons invited Mandel to additional events, and Mandel filed a second visa application in October detailing a more extensive itinerary. On October 23, the Consul at Brussels informed Mandel that the State Department -- headed by Secretary of State William P. Rogers -- refused his first application. The State Department later recommended to Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst that Mandel’s ineligibility be waived with respect to his October application. In a letter dated February 13, 1970, however, the Immigration and Naturalization Service stated that Mandel’s 1968 activities far exceeded the scope of that visa and concluded that the Attorney General should not waive Mandel’s ineligibility. Mandel’s address to the conference was delivered by telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandel, along with various United States citizens who invited Mandel to speaking engagements, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. A three-judge district court panel held in a 2-1 decision that citizens of the United States have a First Amendment right to have Mandel enter the country and to hear him speak. The court entered a declaratory judgment ruling that the portions of the statute delegating the waiver power to the attorney general were invalid as applied to Mandel; it also enjoined Rogers and Kleindienst from denying Mandel admission to the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid Attorney General Kleindienst violate the First Amendment rights of the scholars and students who invited Mandel to the United States by refusing to allow Mandel to enter the country?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs the statute giving Kleindienst this discretionary power unconstitutional on its face?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a 6-3 decision written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court held that the First Amendment did not obligate Kleindienst to grant a waiver to Mandel. Justice Blackmun acknowledged that the First Amendment protected the scholars and students’ right to listen to and engage with Mandel in person --and that Mandel’s participation via telephone was not a good replacement-- but held that the implication of First Amendment rights was not dispositive here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Blackmun noted Congress’ longstanding power to exclude aliens from the United States, and to set the terms and conditions of their entry. Through the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress legitimately delegated to the executive the authority to waive a finding of inadmissibility. He described the historical pattern of increasing federal control on the admissibility of aliens, particularly regarding individuals with Communist affiliation or views. Justice Blackmun held that the Court would not intervene so long as the executive used its waiver power on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason. This test did not balance the First Amendment interests of persons seeking to communicate with the applicant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas dissented. He argued that Kleindienst had no clear interest in preventing Mandel from entering the country, given that Mandel posed no threat to national security. He described Kleindienst’s use of his delegated authority as an act of censorship, an unacceptable executive interpretation of congressional intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan also dissented, in an opinion written by Justice Marshall. He pointed to the Court’s longstanding protection of the right to receive information and ideas, arguing that the government had no power to interrupt the process of free discussion. Justice Marshall questioned the precedential validity of the majority’s “facially legitimate and bona fide reason” test, as well as the truthfulness of the Kleindienst’s stated reasons for excluding Mandel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20837,"name":"Daniel M.

Albert Sarno and Chris Cardi were police officers. The Commission wanted the officers to testify pursuant to an investigation of a \"juice loan\" or \"loan shark\" racket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 8, 1968, the presiding judge in the Circuit Court of Cook County entered an order requiring the petitioners to appear before the commission under a grant of immunity pursuant to an Illinois statute. On February 24, 1968, the officers appeared, but they refused to answer any questions pleading their right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 21, 1968, the Commission filed a motion in the Circuit court, and moved the court to enter an order directing the petitioners to appear before the Commission and answer the questions. The officers filed a motion to dismiss or to strike the foregoing motion. The officers\u0027 motion was denied, and the court entered an order directing the petitioners to appear before the Commission and to answer the questions. The officers refused to obey this subsequent order, still pleading the Fifth Amendment. The officers were found in contempt of court and sentenced to serve a period of six months in the County Jail. The decision of the trial court was appealed and subsequently affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court. The officers appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIf an unwilling witness invokes his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, can a state make that witness testify by granting that witness immunity?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam opinion, the Court cited its own decision in \u003cem\u003e Kastigar v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, and held that testimony may be compelled from an unwilling witness over a claim of Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by the grant of immunity. The Court further determined that any questions regarding the scope of protection under the Illinois immunity statute was best left to the courts of Illinois, meaning that the writ of certiorari was improperly granted. The Supreme Court dismissed the Writ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented for the reasons state in his dissenting opinion in \u003cem\u003eKastigar v.

Wainwright (1963) the Court found that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments required states to provide an attorney to indigent defendants in cases involving serious crimes.

Justice Douglas\u0027s plurality opinion described the intricacies involved in misdemeanor charges and the danger that unrepresented defendants may fall victim to \"assembly-line justice.\" Thus, in order to guarantee fairness in trials involving potential jail time, no matter how petty the charge, the Court found that the state was obligated to provide the accused with counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17968,"name":"Bruce S.

Massachusetts charged Baird with a felony, to distribute contraceptives to unmarried men or women. Under the law, only married couples could obtain contraceptives; only registered doctors or pharmacists could provide them. Baird was not an authorized distributor of contraceptives.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Massachusetts law violate the right to privacy acknowledged in Griswold v. Connecticut and protected from state intrusion by the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-1 decision, the Court struck down the Massachusetts law but not on privacy grounds. The Court held that the law\u0027s distinction between single and married individuals failed to satisfy the \"rational basis test\" of the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause. Married couples were entitled to contraception under the Court\u0027s Griswold decision. Withholding that right to single persons without a rational basis proved the fatal flaw. Thus, the Court did not have to rely on Griswold to invalidate the Massachusetts statute. \"If the right of privacy means anything, wrote Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. for the majority, \"it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32189,"name":"Joseph R.

The statute provided that \"[a]ny person who shall, without provocation, use to or of another, and in his presence . . . opprobrious words or abusive language, tending to cause a breach of the peace . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\" On appeal, Mr. Wilson argued that the statute violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Georgia Supreme Court rejected the argument. Mr. Wilson successfully sought habeas corpus relief from a Georgia federal district court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Georgia statute prohibiting the use of \"opprobrious words or abusive language, tending to cause a breach of the peace\" violate the First Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court held that the Georgia statute was unconstitutional. With Justice William J. Brennan writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Quoting \u003cem\u003eSpeiser v. Randall\u003c/em\u003e, the Court noted that \"the separation of legitimate from illegitimate speech calls for more sensitive tools than (Georgia) has supplied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented. He disagreed with not only the manner in which the majority reached its decision, but also its conclusion. Ultimately, he argued that the statute was narrowly tailored and did not suppress or deter \"important protected speech.\" Justice Harry A. Blackmun also dissented, joined by Chief Justice Burger. He found it implausible that a state could not restrict speech that was as wildly offensive as in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20035,"name":"Courtney Wilder Stanton","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/courtney_wilder_stanton","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stanton","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"courtney_wilder_stanton"},"advocate_description":"for appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/8563"},{"advocate":{"ID":23043,"name":"Elizabeth R.

The Court\u0027s one-page per curiam opinion held that the imposition of the death penalty in these cases constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated the Constitution. In over two hundred pages of concurrence and dissents, the justices articulated their views on this controversial subject. Only Justices Brennan and Marshall believed the death penalty to be unconstitutional in all instances. Other concurrences focused on the arbitrary nature with which death sentences have been imposed, often indicating a racial bias against black defendants. The Court\u0027s decision forced states and the national legislature to rethink their statutes for capital offenses to assure that the death penalty would not be administered in a capricious or discriminatory manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20577,"name":"Dorothy T.

Leroy Irvis, a black man who was a guest of a white member of the Moose Lodge No. 107, was refused service at the club\u0027s dining room because of his race. The bylaws of the Lodge limited membership to white male Caucasians. Irvis challenged the club\u0027s refusal to serve him, arguing that the action of the Pennsylvania liquor board issuing the Lodge a license made the club\u0027s discrimination \"state action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the discriminatory practices violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that the Moose Lodge\u0027s refusal to serve food and beverages to Irvis because he was black did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court noted that the state action doctrine did not necessarily apply to all private entities that received benefits or services from the government; otherwise, the Court reasoned, all private associations that received electricity, water, and fire protection would be subject to state regulation. The Court found that the Moose Lodge \"a private social club in a private building,\" and thus not subject to the Equal Protection Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27910,"name":"Harry J.

On two occasions he was called to testify before state grand juries which were investigating drug crimes. Branzburg refused to testify and potentially disclose the identities of his confidential sources. Similarly, in the companion cases of In re Pappas and United States v. Caldwell, two different reporters, each covering activity within the Black Panther organization, were called to testify before grand juries and reveal trusted information. Like Branzburg, both Pappas and Caldwell refused to appear before their respective grand juries.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the requirement that news reporters appear and testify before state or federal grand juries an abridgement of the freedoms of speech and press as guaranteed by the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court found that requiring reporters to disclose confidential information to grand juries served a \"compelling\" and \"paramount\" state interest and did not violate the First Amendment. Justice White argued that since the case involved no government intervention to impose prior restraint, and no command to publish sources or to disclose them indiscriminately, there was no Constitutional violation. The fact that reporters receive information from sources in confidence does not privilege them to withhold that information during a government investigation; the average citizen is often forced to disclose information received in confidence when summoned to testify in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23468,"name":"Edgar A.

The wallet contained traveler’s checks and his social security card, among other things.  The next day, two police officers stopped Thomas Kirby and his friend, Ralph Bean.  When asked for identification, Kirby produced Shard’s wallet.  The officers arrested Kirby and Bean and brought them to the Maxwell Street Police Station.  Once there, the officers learned about Shard’s robbery and sent a car to pick up Shard and bring him to the station.  Without an attorney present, police asked Shard if Kirby and Bean were his robbers.  Shard instantly gave a positive identification.   Kirby and Bean were not indicted until almost 6 weeks later.  At trial, Kirby unsuccessfully attempted to suppress Shard’s identification.  The jury found Kirby guilty and the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes due process require that an accused be advised of his right to counsel before an identification that takes place before the accused has been charged formally?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a four justice plurality, delivered the judgment of the court.  The plurality expressed that there is no constitutional right to counsel for an identification that takes place before the accused is indicted or formally charged.  For this reason, the Exclusionary Rule does not apply, and the identification can be admitted at trial.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred, emphasizing that the right to counsel does not attach until an accused is formally charged.  Justice Lewis F. Powell concurred in the judgment, agreeing that the Exclusionary Rule does not apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan dissented, arguing that prior Supreme Court Exclusionary Rule precedent just happened to cover post-indictment identifications, but the reasons for using the Rule are the same in pre-indictment cases.  Justice William O. Douglas and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.  Justice Byron R. White dissented, arguing that the Exclusionary Rule applies in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36726,"name":"Michael P.

The three parents refused to send their children to such schools after the eighth grade, arguing that high school attendance was contrary to their religious beliefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Wisconsin\u0027s requirement that all parents send their children to school at least until age 16 violate the First Amendment by criminalizing the conduct of parents who refused to send their children to school for religious reasons?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that individual\u0027s interests in the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment outweighed the State\u0027s interests in compelling school attendance beyond the eighth grade. In the majority opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, the Court found that the values and programs of secondary school were \"in sharp conflict with the fundamental mode of life mandated by the Amish religion,\" and that an additional one or two years of high school would not produce the benefits of public education cited by Wisconsin to justify the law. Justice William O. Douglas filed a partial dissent but joined with the majority regarding Yoder. Justices Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29763,"name":"John W.

The subpoena required him to testify in secret about the party\u0027s activities. Arguing that testifying would destroy his relationship with sources within the party and thereby \"suppress vital First Amendment freedoms . . . by driving a wedge of distrust and silence between the news media and the militants,\" Caldwell and his employer filed a motion to quash the subpoena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Federal District Court denied the motion to quash, but Caldwell nonetheless refused to testify and was held in contempt. Caldwell appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the contempt order on the grounds that requiring Caldwell to testify would cause him to limit the scope of future reporting, amounting to censorship and violating the First Amendment protection of freedom of the press.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the First Amendment\u0027s protection of freedom of the press protect Caldwell from appearing and testifying before the grand jury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court found that requiring reporters to disclose confidential information to grand juries served a \"compelling\" and \"paramount\" state interest and did not violate the First Amendment. Justice White argued that since the case involved no government intervention to impose prior restraint, and no command to publish sources or to disclose them indiscriminately, there was no Constitutional violation. The fact that reporters receive information from sources in confidence does not privilege them to withhold that information during a government investigation; the average citizen is often forced to disclose information received in confidence when summoned to testify in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22386,"name":"Erwin N.

The associations qualified for membership in a “bank for Cooperatives”, which allowed them to borrow money.  The Farm Credit Act of 1955 required that the associations buy Class “C” stocks valued at $100.  The associations claimed a $99 interest deduction on their taxes for every stock purchased.  When the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction, the associations paid the deficiency and then sued for a refund.

After Santobello pled not guilty to both counts, the prosecutor offered him a plea deal. In order to receive a lighter sentence, Santobello could plead guilty to a lesser offense. The prosecutor further agreed not to recommend a sentence to the judge. Santobello accepted the deal and entered a plea of guilty to the lesser offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several months, Santobello still had not been sentenced. By the time the court considered his sentencing, both Santobello’s defense counsel and the original prosecutor had been replaced. The new prosecutor, unaware of the previous prosecutor’s plea offer, recommended the maximum one-year sentence for Santobello’s crime. Despite Santobello’s objections, the court issued the maximum sentence. Santobello appealed, but the appellate court affirmed his conviction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a defendant seek a new trial when a new prosecutor fails to abide by the terms of his predecessor’s plea agreement?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for a 4-3 majority, vacated the judgment and remanded. The opinion emphasized that the plea bargaining process is a crucial part of the criminal justice system. In the interests of justice, agreements between prosecutors and defendants must be upheld. Even though the trial judge claimed that the prosecutor’s recommendation did not influence his sentencing decision, the prosecutor had a duty to uphold the original agreement. The Court remanded the case so that the lower court could determine the appropriate relief for Santobello. Justice Thurgood Marshall concurred in part and dissented in part. He argued that the Court must allow Santobello to withdraw his guilty plea entirely, instead of leaving the decision to the trial court. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Potter Stewart joined in his opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28459,"name":"Irving Anolik","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/irving_anolik","view_count":0,"last_name":"Anolik","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"irving_anolik"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/8644"},{"advocate":{"ID":21545,"name":"Daniel J.

Morrissey entered a guilty plea to an information charging him with false uttering of a check. After serving part of his seven-year sentence, the Iowa Board of Parole granted Morrissey parole, and he was released from Iowa State Penitentiary on June 20, 1968. On January 24, 1969, however, Morrissey was arrested in Cedar Rapids for violating his parole. The Board of Parole entered an order revoking his parole and returning Morrissey to prison. Morrissey filed several habeas corpus actions in Iowa state courts between June 1969 and August 1969, but soon exhausted his state remedies. On September 12, 1969, Morrissey filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court, which was denied; the court also denied his notice of appeal, considered as an application for certificate of probable cause. The United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, granted Morrissey’s application and appointed counsel to represent Morrissey on appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn April 29, 1968, G. Donald Booher entered a guilty plea to an information charging him with forgery. On November 14, 1968, the Board of Parole granted his parole, releasing Booher from his ten-year sentence at Iowa State Penitentiary. On August 28, 1969, Booher allegedly violated his parole, and the Board of Parole revoked his parole on September 13. Booher filed several petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in state district court between November 1969 and March 1970; the district court dismissed all of Booher’s petitions. He then filed an application for certificate of probable cause in federal district court on June 16, 1970. The district court denied his application, but the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, granted it on appeal, appointing counsel and consolidating the claims of Morrissey and Booher. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Morrissey nor Booher was granted a hearing or other opportunity to question, challenge, or become aware of the facts which formed the basis of each man’s parole violation. Neither man was granted the opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf, or to confront or cross-examine those providing testimony against him. The Eighth Circuit, however, affirmed the denials of the petitions of Morrissey and Booher in a 4-3 \u003ci\u003een banc\u003c/i\u003e ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require the Iowa Board of Parole to give an evidentiary hearing prior to revoking the paroles of Morrissey and Booker?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 decision written by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Court held that due process required Iowa to include a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause for the parole revocations of Morrissey and Booker. Chief Justice Burger described the purpose of parole in the correctional process, focusing on the notion that a parolee was entitled to his liberty so long as he substantially abided by the conditions of his parole. He determined that Morrissey and Booker were entitled to some form of due process before Iowa could revoke their paroles. Chief Justice Burger wrote that Iowa had no interest in revoking parole without some informal procedural guarantees, while acknowledging Iowa’s interest in imposing extensive restrictions on parolees and in returning violators to prison without the burden of a new trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Burger wrote that due process required someone not directly involved in a parolee’s case to determine whether reasonable ground existed for revocation. He outlined the basic requirements for the official in charge of a parole revocation hearing, including notice to the parolee, disclosure of evidence, and a written determination by the officer based on the information presented at the hearing. Chief Justice Burger emphasized that parolees had a right to a final hearing prior to revocation held within two months after the parolee was taken into custody. This hearing must give a parolee an opportunity to show that he did not violate the conditions of his parole, and to show mitigating circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Burger declined to decide whether a parolee was entitled to the assistance of counsel if he was indigent. He remanded the case for the district court to make findings on the procedures actually followed by the Board of Parole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Brennan concurred, emphasizing that a parolee was clearly allowed to retain an attorney, leaving open the question of whether counsel must be provided if a parolee was indigent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas dissented in part. He argued that where only a violation of a parole condition was involved, procedural due process required that the state should not arrest a parolee. He wrote that parolees were entitled to counsel, and emphasized that a parolee was entitled to his freedom until the revocation was final.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44105,"name":"W.

Gravel then introduced the study, in its entirety, into the record of a Senate Subcommittee meeting. Gravel also arranged for the private publication of the papers by the Beacon Press. A federal grand jury subpoenaed Leonard Rodberg, one of Gravel\u0027s aides, to testify about his role in the acquisition and publication of the papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the subpoena of Senator Gravel\u0027s aide violate the Speech and Debate Clause of Article I of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that because the work of aides was critical to the performance of legislative tasks and duties, they were nothing less than legislators\u0027 \"alter egos\" and thus immune from subpoenas by the Speech and Debate Clause. Aides were exempted from grand jury questioning so long as Senators invoked the privilege on their behalf. Moreover, the Court held that the protections of the Speech and Debate Clause did not extend beyond the legislative sphere, ruling that Senator Gravel\u0027s arrangements with the Beacon Press were not constitutionally protected.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41270,"name":"Sam J.

The officer approached the vehicle on foot and asked the occupant, Robert Williams, to open the door. When Williams rolled down the window instead, the officer reached into the car and removed a gun from Williams’ waistband, though the gun was not visible from outside the vehicle. The officer then arrested Williams for unlawful possession of a firearm and proceeded to search his vehicle, where he found heroin. Williams was convicted in a Connecticut state court of possession of a handgun and heroin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed the conviction, Williams filed a claim against the prison warden, Frederick Adams, in which he alleged that the state of Connecticut continued to detain him unlawfully as a prisoner. Williams argued that the handgun and drugs were discovered through an unlawful search and should not have been admitted into evidence at his trial. The district court denied his petition. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sided with Williams and ordered that his conviction be set aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment allow a police officer, acting only on a tip from an informant, to approach a person and remove a weapon concealed in the person’s waistband?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the informant’s tip permitted the officer to approach Williams’ car and make a limited search of Williams’ waistband for the officer’s own protection. The Court further held that the discovery of the weapon gave the officer probable cause to arrest Williams’ for illegal possession of a firearm. Because the officer’s subsequent search of the vehicle was permissible, the narcotics he discovered were admissible at Williams’ trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent in which he argued that the officer did not have probable cause to arrest Williams’ for illegal possession of a firearm because Connecticut’s “free-and-easy” gun laws allow individuals to carry concealed weapons so long as they have a permit. Justice Thurgood Marshall concurred in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. expressed concern that the unnamed informant gave no information that the officer could not have readily manufactured after seizing the weapon. Therefore, Justice Brennan argued that police officers should not be permitted to arrest and search individuals on the basis of an informant’s tip alone. Justice Marshall also wrote a separate dissent in which he argued that the prosecutors failed to meet their burden to prove that the informant’s information was reliable and sufficient to justify the arrest and search of Williams.

The handbills were unrelated to the operations of Lloyd Center. Lloyd Center was privately owned by Lloyd Corporation, which prohibited the distribution of handbills inside the mall. While distributing handbills, Tanner and other protestors were informed by mall security that they should stop their distribution or be subject to arrest. The protestors ended their distribution, left the mall, and filed suit against Lloyd Corporation in United States District Court for the District of Oregon alleging their First Amendment right to free speech had been violated. The District Court ruled in their favor. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWere Tanner and the other protestors\u0027 First Amendment right to free speech violated by Lloyd\u0027s refusal to allow them to distribute handbills on mall property?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and held that Tanner was not entitled to distribute handbills within Lloyd Center. Writing for the majority, Justice Lewis F. Powell contrasted this case with \u003cem\u003eAmalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza\u003c/em\u003e, which allowed protestors to picket a shopping center when their picketing was \"directly related\" to the shopping center and no \"reasonable opportunities to convey their message…were available.\" Here, Tanner\u0027s were unrelated to the operations of the mall, and the protestors had an alternative on the sidewalks immediately outside the mall, which were owned by the City of Portland. Powell characterized equating public property with private property intended for public use – such as the mall – as \"reach[ing] too far.\" Therefore, Tanner and the protestors did not have a First Amendment right to distribute their handbills within the mall.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24978,"name":"George Black Jr.","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/george_black_jr","view_count":0,"last_name":"Black","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"george_black_jr"},"advocate_description":"argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/8677"},{"advocate":{"ID":19717,"name":"Carl R.

More than two years after the injury, Huson sued Chevron for damages in United States District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, New Orleans Division. Huson alleged that it took several months for him to realize the severity of his injury. The District Court relied on \u003cem\u003eRodrigue v Aetna Casualty \u0026amp; Surety Co.\u003c/em\u003e, 395 U.S. 352 (1969), holding that Louisiana\u0027s one-year statute of limitations applied instead of the admiralty laches doctrine so Huson\u0027s claim was barred. \u003cem\u003eRodrigue\u003c/em\u003e held that state law, not admiralty law, applied in these situations under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Huson argued that because he filed this case before the \u003cem\u003eRodrigue\u003c/em\u003e decision, applying its ruling would have an unfair retrospective effect. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Louisiana statute of limitations was inconsistent with the admiralty laches doctrine and, therefore, was not applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Louisiana statute of limitations inconsistent with the admiralty laches doctrine? Should \u003cem\u003eRogrique\u003c/em\u003e be retroactively applied?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No. In a 7-0 decision, Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a majority unanimous court, affirmed the Appeals Court\u0027s decision, but rejected their analysis. The Supreme Court held that Louisiana\u0027s statute of limitations was applicable under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act because the Lands Act specifically adopted relevant state laws as federal laws. There was no federal statute of limitations specified in the Lands Act so, state law was not inconsistent. Although applying Louisiana\u0027s one-year statute of limitations was proper as a general rule, the Court held that applying it in this case would unfairly deprive Huson of a remedy on the basis of an unforeseeable change in legal doctrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41362,"name":"Samuel C.

The agents recorded conversations between Paul and David Gelbard and between Zarowitz and Sidney Parnas. Gelbard and Parnas were called before a federal grand jury convened to investigate possible violations of federal gambling laws. When the government pressed Gelbard and Parnas to testify about these conversations, however, they refused to do so. Instead, they claimed that the wiretaps were illegal and argued that they should not be required to testify until given an opportunity to challenge the legality of the taps. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California found Gelbard and Parnas in contempt of court and committed them to custody until they agreed to testify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court, stating that \"a witness in a grand jury proceeding has no right to resort to a court to secure authoritative advance determination concerning evidentiary matters that arise, or may arise, or to exclude evidence to be used in such a proceeding.\" Gelbard and Parnas then sought certiorari from the Court, pointing to a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacating contempt charges against a witness under similar circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan grand jury witnesses invoke the federal statute prohibiting illegal wiretapping as a defense to civil contempt charges based on their refusal to testify regarding information revealed by those illegal taps?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, they can. In a 5-4 majority opinion written by Justice William Brennan, the Court held that the federal statute barring the use of evidence obtained through illegally intercepted communications also serves as a valid defense to civil contempt charges. Justice William O. Douglas concurred, expressing his belief that the Fourth Amendment\u0027s prohibition against illegal searches and seizures provided enough protection in and of itself to suppress the illegally obtained communications even without the federal wiretapping statute. In a separate concurrence, Justice Byron White suggested that courts should look for a way other than suppression hearings, which are time consuming and can interrupt the flow of grand jury hearings, to resolve such conflicts. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Harry Blackmun and Lewis Powell, dissented. Rehnquist argued that the clear language of the statute in question, combined with its legislative history, prohibited its use as a defense to civil contempt charges arising from grand jury proceedings. To apply it in that situation would represented a \"sharp break\" with the \"historical \u003cem\u003emodus operandi\u003c/em\u003e of the grand jury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36803,"name":"Michael E.

Pappas intended to cover a Black Panther news conference. Pappas was admitted inside the Panther headquarters after agreeing that he would not disclose anything he saw or heard. Pappas stayed for three hours. He did not write a story based on his experience. Pappas was later summoned before a grand jury but he refused to answer questions about events that took place inside Panther headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the First Amendment\u0027s freedom of the press protect Pappas from appearing and testifying before the grand jury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court found that requiring reporters to disclose confidential information to grand juries served a \"compelling\" and \"paramount\" state interest and did not violate the First Amendment. Justice White argued that since the cases involved no government intervention to impose prior restraint, and no command to publish sources or to disclose them indiscriminately, there was no constitutional violation.

Flood was a professional baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League. Flood was a consistent, above-average hitter and a well-regarded outfielder, playing one full season without an error in 1966, an unusual achievement. Flood played twelve seasons for the Cardinals, participating in three World Series, and was the co-captain of the team between 1965 and 1969.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite this, Flood was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in October 1969. The Cardinals did not consult him before the trade, and management only informed him about the trade after it was finalized. Flood complained to the Commissioner of Baseball, Bowie K. Kuhn, requesting that the league make him a free agent. Kuhn denied his request, relying on baseball’s “reserve clause,” which maintained a given team’s rights to a player even after that player’s contract expired. Flood then filed an antitrust suit against Kuhn, the presidents of the two major leagues, and the twenty-four major league clubs. He declined to play for the Phillies in 1970 despite a $100,000 salary offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlood alleged violations of the federal antitrust laws, civil rights laws, state statutes, the common law, and the imposition of a form of peonage and involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment and several federal laws. The trial court granted the defense’s motion for summary judgment, relying on \u003ci\u003eFederal Baseball Club v. National League\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eToolson v. New York Yankees\u003c/i\u003e, which established a long-standing antitrust exemption for professional baseball clubs. The United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Was professional baseball’s reserve system subject to federal antitrust law?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas professional baseball subject to state antitrust laws?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a 5-3 decision written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the Court affirmed that professional baseball and its reserve clause were immune from antitrust laws at the state and federal levels. Justice Blackmun described the background of \u003ci\u003eFederal Baseball\u003c/i\u003e, emphasizing that antitrust violations against professional baseball were consistently rejected on that case’s authority. He also cited \u003ci\u003eToolson\u003c/i\u003e, where the Court specifically held that the business of holding public baseball games for profit between professional clubs was not within the scope of federal antitrust laws. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Blackmun also noted that \u003ci\u003eFederal Baseball\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eToolson\u003c/i\u003e were frequently and favorably cited in other cases to establish the uniqueness of baseball’s exemption. He also noted that it was within Congress’ power to remedy this inconsistency. Finally, Justice Blackmun agreed with the Second Circuit that the Commerce Clause precluded the application of state antitrust laws to professional baseball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren Burger concurred, but agreed with Justice William Douglas that congressional inaction was not a solid basis to affirm the antitrust exemption for professional baseball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas dissented, joined by Justice William Brennan. He argued that the ruling in \u003ci\u003eFederal Baseball\u003c/i\u003e was a derelict, and that the reserve system was clearly an unreasonable restraint of trade. He also questioned the majority’s reliance on congressional inaction as evidence of Congress’ intent.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall also dissented, joined by Justice Brennan. Justice Marshall compared baseball’s reserve system to involuntary servitude. He also questioned the significance of congressional inaction. Justice Marshall argued that the Court should remand the case to determine whether Flood could state a claim despite the existence of a collective bargaining agreement between the teams and the players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38229,"name":"Paul A.

Haines was 66 years old and suffered from a foot disability. He claimed his foot disability worsened due to being kept in solitary confinement, where he had to sleep on the floor with only blankets for support. Haines sued the State of Illinois and argued that the conditions of his solitary confinement violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The State of Illinois moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that Haines failed to state a cause of action. The district court granted the dismissal, and stated that courts can only intercede with the internal operations of state prisons under exceptional circumstances. The district court also found that Haines had failed to show that he had been deprived of his constitutional rights. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the dismissal and determined that state penitentiaries were entitled to their own discretion when punishing inmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an inmate have the right to offer proof of an alleged injury before his case is dismissed on the grounds of failure to state a cause of action for said injury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eBefore a case is dismissed for failure to state a cause of action, the plaintiff should be allowed to offer evidence supporting his claims. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that Haines had a right to present evidence of the alleged harm he suffered before his case was dismissed. Without such an opportunity, there could be no certainty that there was no set of facts to support the plaintiff’s claims that would entitle him to relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Lewis F.

Overmyer Co. entered into a contract with Frick Co. for the manufacture and installation of a $223,000 automatic refrigeration system for a warehouse under construction in Toledo, Ohio. The agreement established a promissory note with monthly payment obligations. Overmyer began to fall behind on the monthly payments. Frick filed three mechanic\u0027s liens against the Toledo warehouse, and the two companies negotiated a new payment agreement in February 1967. Overmyer again fell behind on payments, and the two companies established a new note which contained a confession-of-judgment provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June of 1968, Overmyer stopped making monthly payments under the new note and brought a claim against Frick in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for alleged breaches of the original contract. The District court concluded that the plaintiff failed to show any likelihood that it would prevail on the merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrick came before the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County, Ohio and asked the court to enter a judgment against Overmyer for the remaining balance of the note plus interest. Overmyer did not receive notice prior to the entry of the judgment because the confession-of-judgment provision waived the issuance and service of process and confessed judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the entry of the adverse judgment, Overmyer filed several motions, including a motion to vacate the judgment due to a lack of notice. After a hearing was held, the court denied the motions. Overmyer appealed to the Court of Appeals for Lucas County, Ohio, asserting deprivation of due process in violation of the Ohio and Federal Constitutions. The appellate court affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision. The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the subsequent appeal, and Overmyer appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the constitutional right to notice be surrendered as part of consideration for a contract?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court and held that contractual clause waiving a party\u0027s rights to prejudgment notice and hearing is not unconstitutional per se. Since Overmyer agreed to the provision for consideration and with full awareness of the legal consequences, enforcement of the waiver was not a violation of Overmyer\u0027s constitutional rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas, with whom Justice Thurgood Marshall joined, wrote a concurring opinion. Douglas agreed that the heavy burden against the waiver of constitutional rights had been effectively overcome by the evidence presented. However, he emphasized the fact that a trial judge is duty-bound to vacate judgments obtained through clauses waiving due process rights whenever debtors present jury questions is a minimal obstacle, and complete answer to the contention that unbridled discretion governs the disposition of petitions to vacate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis Powell and Justice William H. Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38625,"name":"Russell Morton Brown","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/russell_morton_brown","view_count":0,"last_name":"Brown","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"russell_morton_brown"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/8743"},{"advocate":{"ID":25441,"name":"Gregory M.

Shortly afterward, police arrested Silas Manning and Willie Barker for the crime. Both were indicted on September 15 and assigned counsel on September 17. Barker’s trial was scheduled to begin on September 21, but the state believed it had a stronger case against Manning and that Manning’s testimony would be essential to convict Barker. The state obtained a series of continuances on Barker’s trial, as Manning was tried five times and finally convicted in 1962. Beginning in June 1959, Barker was out of prison on bail, and did not contest the continuances. Barker’s trial was set for March 19, 1963, and when the state requested further continuances, Barker unsuccessfully objected. At his trial beginning on October 9, 1963, Barker was convicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. Barker sought habeas corpus relief in district court, by arguing that the long trial delay violated his right to a speedy trial, which the district court denied. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e Can the right to a speedy trial be implicitly waived?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the right to a speedy trial differs from other constitutionally guaranteed rights because it is often more in the interest of society and the justice system as a whole than it is in the interest of the accused. Additionally, there is no way to create a firm distinction between what is and is not a speedy trial, since the circumstances surrounding each trial are unique. The Court held that the consideration of whether a defendant was denied a speedy trial should be based on the length of the delay, the reason for it, the defendant’s assertion of the right, and prejudice towards the defendant. The Court held that, while the delay was long, Barker faced negligible prejudice and did not want a speedy trial, as evidenced by the many continuances that went uncontested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Byron R. White described the many reasons that a speedy trial is essential to prevent an unconstitutional infringement on the liberty of the defendant. He argued that the right could not be compromised by a state’s backlog of cases and limited resources. Given the facts of this case, however, he agreed that Barker acquiesced to the delays without state pressure. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31705,"name":"James E.

Generes and Kelly each owned 44% of the stock, with the remaining 12% owned by Generes’ son and another son-in-law. Generes was the president of the corporation and did not deal with the day-to-day running of the business. In addition to his position as president, he held another full-time position as the president of a savings and loan association. In 1958, Generes and Kelly signed an indemnity agreement for the corporation. In 1962, the corporation seriously underbid two contracts and went deeply into debt. Generes loaned the corporation money, but it went bankrupt, and he was unable to receive reimbursement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his 1962 tax return, Generes claimed the money the corporation lost as business bad debt and his direct loans to the corporation as nonbusiness bad debt. He filed a claim for a refund on the business bad debt. This claim was the subject of a jury trial in which the jury was asked to determine whether Generes’ signing of the indemnity agreement was “proximately related to his trade or business of being an employee “of the corporation. The government requested a jury instruction to clarify that “significant” motivation satisfies the requirement, but the court refused and instructed the jury that “dominant” motivation was sufficient. The jury found in favor of Generes. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and held that the significant motivation standard was acceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan an individual who is both employee and shareholder in a corporation claim the corporation’s losses as business bad debt for tax purposes?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 4-3 plurality. The Supreme Court held that the significant motivation standard did not provide sufficient guidance to the trier of fact and that the dominant motivation standard should have been used. Under this standard, Generes’ actions were in his own interest and not those of the corporation, so he cannot claim the corporation’s loss as business bad debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote that the congressional intent behind the statute distinguishing nonbusiness bad debt from business bad debt was to prevent family members from loaning money they knew they would not get back and getting tax refunds for it. He argued that the dominant motivation standard best protects Congress’ interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a partial concurrence and partial dissent in which he argued that the plurality should not have ruled on the merits of the case but should have remanded the case for a new trial under the new standard. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., joined in the partial concurrence and partial dissent. In his dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the wording of the statute does not require proof of a dominant motivation. He also argued that there was sufficient evidence that Generes’ actions were “proximately related” to his business interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Justice William H. Rehnquist did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36970,"name":"Matthew J.

In the late 1940s, developers began to make bids on the land for recreational developments. Walt Disney Enterprises won a bid to start surveying the valley in the hopes of developing an 80-acre ski resort. The size of the proposed resort would require the construction of a new highway and massive high voltage power lines that would run through the Sequoia National Forest. The Sierra Club kept track of this project for years and hoped to stop it to protect the undeveloped land. The Sierra Club filed preliminary and permanent injunctions against federal officials to prevent them from granting permits for the development of the Mineral King Valley. The district court granted these injunctions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the injunctions on the grounds that the Sierra Club did not show that it would be directly affected by the actions of the defendants and therefore did not have standing to sue under the Administrative Procedure Act. Alternatively, the appellate court also held that the Sierra Club had not made an adequate showing of irreparable injury or likelihood of their success on the merits of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Sierra Club adequately establish that it had a sufficient stake in the development of the Mineral King Valley to establish standing for a suit under the Administrative Procedure Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Sierra Club did not have standing to sue under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it failed to show that any of its members had suffered or would suffer injury as a result of the defendants’ actions. Justice Potter Stewart wrote the opinion for the 4-3 majority, in which the Court held that, in order to have standing to sue under the APA, the plaintiffs must demonstrate they had directly suffered an injury as a result of the actions that led to the suit. Although building roads and high voltage power lines through the wilderness upsets the beauty of the area and the enjoyment of some, such “general interest” in a potential problem is not sufficient to establish that a plaintiff has been injured in the manner that standing doctrine requires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the standing doctrine should allow environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club to sue on behalf of inanimate objects such as land. There is precedent for inanimate objects to have legal personality for the purpose of lawsuits, and “[t]hose who have that intimate relation with the inanimate object about to be injured, polluted, or otherwise despoiled are its legitimate spokesmen.” In his separate dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun argued that, when faced with new issues of potentially enormous and permanent consequences, such as environmental issues, the Court should not be quite so rigid about its legal requirements. Justice Blackmun proposed two alternatives for how to proceed in this case: either the Sierra Club’s request for preliminary injunction should be granted while it is given time to amend its complaint to comport with the requirements of the standing doctrine, or the Court should expand the traditional standing doctrine to allow this type of litigation. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. also wrote a separate dissent in which he agreed with Justice Blackmun regarding the Sierra Club’s standing and argued that the Court should have considered the case on its merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Justice William H. Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35052,"name":"Leland R.

They challenged the conditions of their confinement and the procedures that led to their commitment. They also argued that Maryland\u0027s statutory standard for the commitment of \"delinquent defendants\" was unconstitutionally vague. The district court denied relief.

In a per curiam opinion, the Court wrote that it had decided to hear the case in order to consider whether constitutional protections apply to the commitment process set forth in the Maryland Defective Delinquency Law. After briefing and oral argument, the Court concluded that the case did not present those issues in a manner that warranted the review of the Supreme Court. The Court also concluded that pending changes to the Maryland law made it an inopportune time for the Court to issue a comprehensive order concerning the Defective Delinquency Law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion. He argued that whenever a State moves to deprive an individual of liberty, the Constitution requires the state to meet a more rigorous burden of proof than Maryland employed to commit defective delinquents.

After his election as president of the Texas Junior College Teachers Association, he had several public disagreements with the Odessa Junior College Board of Regents. In May 1969, after the expiration of his teaching contract, Sindermann was not offered a new contract and terminated by the college\u0027s Board of Regents. While the Board of Regents did issue a press release accusing him of insubordination, they did not provide official reasons for his termination or the option of a hearing for him to challenge his termination. Sindermann filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. He alleged that his termination was due to his disagreements with the Board of Regents, a violation of his First Amendment right to free speech, and that the lack of a hearing violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. The District Court ruled for the Board of Regents without a full trial. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which held that his termination would have been unconstitutional if it was based on his exercise of free speech or if he had a reasonable expectation of continued employment. The Fifth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Was Sindermann entitled to a full trial in District Court?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was Sindermann entitled to a hearing before the Board of Regents?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. In a 5-3 decision, the Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit and held that Sindermann was entitled to a full trial in federal District Court and a hearing before the Board of Regents. The Court acknowledged that Sindermann did not have a contractual or tenure-based right to continued employment by Odessa Junior College. However, this lack was \"immaterial to [Sindermann\u0027s] free speech claim.\" Writing for the majority, Justice Potter Stewart relied on \u003cem\u003eShelton v. Tucker\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eKeyishian v. Board of Regents\u003c/em\u003e in emphasizing that nonrenewal of a one-year teaching contract \"may not be predicated on [a teacher\u0027s] exercise of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\" However, the Court stopped short of invalidating Sindermann\u0027s termination, as the Board of Regents\u0027 reasoning had not been established. While Sindermann had yet to \"show that he has been deprived of an interest that could invoke procedural due process,\" the Court stated that his claim did \"raise a genuine issue.\" While Odessa College did not have a formal tenure system, the Court recognized the possibility of a college having an \"unwritten \u0027common law\u0027\" \"in practice\" that would grant \"the equivalent of tenure.\" Given the policies of Odessa College, Sindermann was entitled to a hearing before the Board of Regents as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":46309,"name":"W.
