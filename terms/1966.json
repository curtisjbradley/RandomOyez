At trial, the jury could not reach a verdict.  The Superior Court judge continued the case twice when the state moved for a nolle prosequi with leave.  This would allow the state to suspend their prosecution indefinitely and return the case to the docket in the future.  Klopfer objected, arguing that the motion violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, but the judge granted the state’s request.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed, holding that the right to a speedy trial does not include the right to compel the state to prosecute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the nolle prosequi deny Klopfer his constitutional right to a speedy trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a unanimous decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that indefinitely suspending a trial violates a defendant’s right to a speedy trial.  The Court also held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies the Sixth Amendment to the states.  The Court noted that almost every state has rejected the Supreme Court of North Carolina’s reasoning.  Justice John M. Harlan concurred in the result, but argued that incorporating the Sixth Amendment is not necessary.  He based his decision solely on the Fourteenth Amendment.  Justice Potter Stewart also concurred in the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45824,"name":"Wade H.

As state employees, Keyishian and the other faculty members were subject to statutes and administrative regulations meant to prevent the appointment and continued employment of “subversive persons.” Because the appellants refused to sign a statement declaring that they were not Communists and had never been Communists, they were subject to dismissal and/or non-renewal of contract. The appellants sued for declaratory and injunctive relief and argued that the program of statutes and regulations violate the Constitution. A three-judge federal court upheld the constitutionality of the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre the provisions requiring public servants to formally renounce Communism so overly broad and vague that they are unconstitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the provisions of the New York plan were defined in such uncertain terms that they infringed upon the constitutional rights of public servants. Because the country had an interest in protecting the First Amendment rights of teachers in order for the educational system to be as free and open as possible, such overly broad and vague requirements both violated the teachers’ rights and were detrimental to the profession. The Court held that the government could only regulate First Amendment rights with “narrow specificity.” The Court also held that specific provisions of the Civil Service Law and Educational Service Law were too overly broad because they prohibit membership in the Communist Party without determining whether or not there was any specific intent to overthrow the United States government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark dissented and argued that the duties of a public servant allow the government to inquire into the employee’s fitness to serve in a particular position. He also argued that the provisions in question are specific to actions that “advocate, advise, or teach” the overthrow of the United States government and are not unconstitutionally vague. Justice John M. Harlan, Justice Potter Stewart, and Justice Byron R. White joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39786,"name":"Richard Lipsitz","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/richard_lipsitz","view_count":0,"last_name":"Lipsitz","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"richard_lipsitz"},"advocate_description":"for the appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21756"},{"advocate":{"ID":39579,"name":"Ruth V.

Canada Packers agreed to, and paid, a joint through international rate for the shipment.  Later, Canada Packers’ sued the railroads for reparations citing the international rate as unreasonable.  The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ordered the railroads to pay reparations to make up for the unreasonably low original payment.  The railroads refused to pay for the part of the journey that took place in Canada, arguing that the ICC had no authority to regulate shipping rates outside the U.S.A.  The district court ruled in favor of Canada Packers and the court of appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Interstate Commerce Commission have the power to determine a reasonable shipping rate outside the United States?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals.  The Court held that the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) authorizes the ICC to determine reasonable rates where a carrier has entered into a joint through international rate covering transportation in the United States and abroad.  Consequently, the ICC had the authority to order reparations.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent citing the ICA, which states the ICC can only regulate “insofar as such transportation…takes place within the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19646,"name":"Charles B.

Gault had previously been placed on probation. The police did not leave notice with Gault\u0027s parents, who were at work, when the youth was arrested. After proceedings before a juvenile court judge, Gault was committed to the State Industrial School until he reached the age of 21.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWere the procedures used to commit Gault constitutionally legitimate under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The proceedings of the Juvenile Court failed to comply with the Constitution. The Court held that the proceedings for juveniles had to comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. These requirements included adequate notice of charges, notification of both the parents and the child of the juvenile\u0027s right to counsel, opportunity for confrontation and cross-examination at the hearings, and adequate safeguards against self-incrimination.

As part of that investigation, police officers were brought in for questioning. They were told that anything they said might be used against them in a state criminal proceeding and that they could refuse to answer, but such refusal might be grounds for dismissal. The appellants represent a group of police officers who answered the questions and were charged with conspiracy to obstruct the administration of traffic laws. The appellants were convicted and they appealed by arguing that their statements were coerced by the threat of the loss of employment. The Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed the convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the threat of loss of employment constitute coercion that violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Supreme Court held that the threat of the loss of employment placed the interviewee in the bind of being forced to choose between self-incrimination and the loss of livelihood. In such a situation, there is no chance for the interviewee to reach a free and rational decision. The Court also held that policemen and other public servants are entitled to the same constitutional rights as other citizens, and that there was precedent to establish threat of a loss of employment as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that there should not be an inflexible rule regarding coercion, but rather that each case should be decided based on its individual facts. He argued that the government had a valid interest in ensuring the integrity of its police officers and other public servants, and that the Fifth Amendment does not prevent the state from discharging an employee who refuses to answer questions regarding his job performance and conditions for future employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice John M. Harlan wrote that there was no evidence that the admissions were involuntary, given the fact that all the officers were informed of their rights and had counsel present at their interviews. There is no reason to suspect that they were subject to mental coercion based on any of the techniques that were present in previous coercion cases. He also argued that the statements were admissible as a matter of law because it is constitutionally permissible for a state to establish reasonable qualifications and standards of conduct for its employees. There was no constitutional reason for an employer to be unable to expect an employee to provide information pertinent to his employment. Justice Tom C. Clark and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21330,"name":"Daniel L.

Furthermore, since the sheriff acted to maintain access to the jail house and not because he \"objected to what was being sung . . . or disagreed with the objectives of the protest,\" there were no First Amendment violations.

Gilbert refused to answer questions about the robbery charge without the advice of counsel, but later answered questions about a robbery in which the robber, allegedly Gilbert, used a handwritten note demanding the money. He gave the police handwriting exemplars, which were later admitted into evidence. The police also had eyewitnesses identify Gilbert in a line-up that was conducted without notice to his counsel. During the trial, several witnesses identified Gilbert in the courtroom as being a part of multiple robberies, including the Alhambra robbery. No distinction was made as to whether the in-court identifications were independent of the illegal line-ups that occurred before the trial. The jury rendered a guilty verdict and imposed the death penalty. The California Supreme Court affirmed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does taking of handwriting exemplars violate the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Are in-court identifications unconstitutional if there was no determination of whether they were influenced by an illegal lineup procedure? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that taking the handwriting exemplars was constitutional. While the Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination, a handwriting exemplar simply identifies a physical characteristic and is therefore outside of its protection. Also, taking exemplars without counsel present would not affect the defendant’s right to a fair trial. The Court held that the admission of the in-court identifications without determining them to be impartial violates the Constitution. Since the identification line-up was the result of an illegal procedure, the state must establish that the in-court identifications are independent of those conducted illegally. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black delivered an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he argued that the admission of the writing exemplars violated Gilbert’s constitutional rights because his counsel was not present at the time this evidence was obtained. In his separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the general search for evidence did not violate the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that there was no need to establish that the in-court identifications were independent from the illegal identification line-up. Justice John M. Harlan and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34783,"name":"Luke McKissack","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/luke_mckissack","view_count":0,"last_name":"McKissack","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"luke_mckissack"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21487"},{"advocate":{"ID":37300,"name":"Norman H.

Arnold only allowed distributors to sell its products to approved dealers.  The United States complaint attached this practice as an unlawful restraint on trade.  The district court held that this practice was unlawful as to sales from distributors to dealers, but allowed for sales directly from Arnold to dealers.  The Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Schwinn’s practice of only selling products to approved dealers violated the Sherman Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eSometimes.  In a 5-2 decision, Justice Abe Fortas wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that it is unreasonable for a manufacturer to restrict where its products are sold after it has transferred title and responsibility for loss.  In situations where Arnold retains title, and the dealer acts as an agent or salesperson, those restrictions are not a restraint on trade.  Justice Potter Stewart wrote a partial dissent, expressing disagreement with the majority’s argument that Arnold’s practices become illegal when carried out through a distributor.  Justice John M. Harlan joined in the partial dissent.  Justice Tom C. Clark and Justice Byron R. White did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40232,"name":"Richard A.

His wife was also injured in the attack. The next day, Theodore Stovall was arrested for the murder and promptly arraigned, but he did not yet have counsel. On August 25, although Stovall had still not retained counsel, police brought him to the hospital room where Mrs. Berheldt’s was recovering from surgery to see if she could identify him. Stovall was the only African-American man in the room and was handcuffed to a police officer. Mrs. Berheldt positively identified him after he was directed to say a few words for voice identification purposes. The prosecution used this identification as evidence in the trial, and Mrs. Berheldt again identified Stovall in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStovall was convicted, and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed. Stovall sought habeas corpus relief in district court on the grounds that Mrs. Berheldt’s identification was inadmissible. The district court dismissed after hearing argument on an unrelated issue. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1967, the Court issued rulings in \u003ci\u003eUnited States v. Wade\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eGilbert v. California\u003c/i\u003e that excluded identification evidence from trial when identification came from a tainted lineup — one at which the defendants did not have counsel present.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Can the rulings in \u003ci\u003eUnited States v. Wade\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eGilbert v. California\u003c/i\u003e be applied retroactively?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did Mrs. Berheldt’s identification of Stovall deprive him of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the decision to retroactively apply rulings of criminal procedure depended on the potential impact of that ruling on the fact-finding at trial. In this case, the identification, while a crucial stage of the investigation and trial, could be conducted well or poorly regardless of the presence of counsel. The Court held that the circumstances of this case were such that, given the uncertainty of Mrs. Berheldt’s medical status, the identification could not have been conducted any other way. Also, the retroactive application of the rulings in \u003ci\u003eUnited States v. Wade\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eGilbert v. California\u003c/i\u003e would greatly disrupt the justice system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Byron R. White wrote that the identification in the hospital room was not constitutionally improper. Justice John M. Harlan and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent and argued that the right to have counsel present at an identification should be granted retroactively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abe Fortas wrote a dissent and argued that the State’s use of the hospital identification in the trial was prejudicial and violated Stovall’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissent, Justice Hugo L. Black argued that people put in prison by evidence that is later found unconstitutional should not be denied the benefit of those rulings. He also argued that the Court’s case-by-case determination of due process granted the Court too much power and failed to give the government a solid constitutional standard. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34922,"name":"Leon B.

The trial court properly left the question of entrapment to the jury.  Justice William O.

In 1965, he sold copies of two pulp sex novels to a plainclothes police officer. New York City\u0027s criminal court tried and convicted Redrup for selling obscene material under New York Penal Law. The Supreme Court of New York affirmed. Harlan Publishing, the producers of the allegedly obscene material, supported Redrup throughout his appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam Austin owned a retail bookstore and newsstand in Paducah, Kentucky. A woman purchased two magazines from a salesperson in Austin\u0027s store, asking for them by name –High Heels and Spree. Austin was tried and convicted of distributing obscene materials under Kentucky law. In a \u003cem\u003eper curiam\u003c/em\u003e decision with one dissent, the Kentucky Court of Appeals overruled Austin\u0027s appeal, finding no error in the trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGent, Swank, Modern Man, Bachelor, Cavalcade, Gentleman, Ace and Sir, were allegedly obscene magazines distributed by W.E. Burnham in Jefferson County, Arkansas. The Jefferson chancery court found the magazines to be obscene under an Arkansas anti-obscenity law and enjoined their distribution. The Supreme Court of Arkansas upheld this ruling despite admitting error in jury selection and instruction. Writing for the majority with two dissents, Chief Justice Carleton Harris argued that the magazines violated the contemporary community values of Jefferson County, but that one magazine was entitled to appeal the ruling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo petitioners\u0027 obscenity convictions violate their First Amendment rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a \u003cem\u003eper curiam\u003c/em\u003e decision, the court reversed the judgments of the respective lower courts, holding that while members of the majority advocated a variety of legal approaches to obscenity cases, the judgments at hand did not withstand scrutiny under any of the available approaches. The court specified that two of its members argue that the court has no authority to control publications on obscenity grounds, a third member limits the state\u0027s authority to a specific and readily identifiable class of material, and other members limit the state\u0027s authority to prurient material that is offensive to the specific community and has no redeeming social value. Yet another justice did not view social value as an independent factor. The court held that the judgments failed all of these tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan, joined by Justice Thomas Clark, dissented, noting that \u003cem\u003eRedrup v. New York\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAustin v. Kentucky\u003c/em\u003e originally raised questions regarding the scienter requirement in obscenity prosecutions; \u003cem\u003eGent v. Arkansas\u003c/em\u003e was granted review to answer questions of vagueness and prior restraint under an Arkansas anti-obscenity statute. He argued that the majority decided a question that was not before it and in doing so avoided the questions of scienter, vagueness and prior restraint actually raised by the cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14972,"title":"Oral Argument - October 10, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14972"},{"id":23558,"title":"Oral Argument - October 10, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23558"},{"id":23602,"title":"Oral Argument - October 11, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23602"},{"id":23656,"title":"Oral Argument - October 11, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23656"}],"citation":{"volume":"386","page":"767","year":"1967","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26018"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

In the lead case, a district court in Tennessee tried and convicted James Hoffa, the president of a labor union, for attempting to bribe members of a jury in an earlier trial.  A paid government informer provided substantial evidence in the bribery trial.  The informer was another local union officer who met with Hoffa on several occasions during the first trial.  At that time, the government had not hired the officer as an informant.  Hoffa alleged that the evidence gathered from this informer violated his Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid use of the informant’s evidence invalidate the convictions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Potter Stewart wrote a plurality opinion for four members of the court affirming the court of appeals.  The plurality held that the government did not procure the evidence deceptively.  Use of the evidence did not violate Hoffa’s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure or his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark wrote a dissent, stating that the writs should be dismissed as improvidently granted.  Justice William O. Douglas joined in this dissent.

Without giving notice to Wade’s counsel, an FBI officer set up a lineup for two bank employees including Wade and several other prisoners.  The officer had each prisoner put strips of tape on their face and say, “Put the money in the bag,” like the robbers did.  The employees identified Wade as the robber.  At trial, the employees identified him again.  Wade’s counsel moved to strike the identifications because the lineup violated Wade’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The trial court denied the motion, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the lineup without counsel violated the Sixth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a lineup conducted without notifying a suspect\u0027s counsel require exclusion of an in-court identification of a suspect by a witness be excluded from trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eMaybe.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William J. Brennan vacated the lower judgment and remanded to determine whether the employees based their trial identifications solely on the lineup.  The Supreme Court affirmed that the lineup did not violate Wade’s privilege against self-incrimination.  To decide the Sixth Amendment issue, courts must decide whether counsel’s presence at a pre-trial confrontation of the accused will preserve the accused’s right to a fair trial.  In this case, Wade was entitled to counsel at the lineup.  The Court held that the identifications should not be excluded if they were based on observations other than the lineup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black dissented in part and concurred in part, expressing that the lineup violated Wade\u0027s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  Justice Black would affirm the conviction, though, because the prosecution did not use evidence of the lineup at trial.  Justice Byron R. White dissented in part and concurred in part, stating that Wade was not entitled to counsel at the lineup.  Justice John M. Harlan and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the opinion.

Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e (1964) the Court held that public officials in libel cases must show that a statement was made \"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\" These two cases concern libel as it pertains to public figures who are not public officials. \u003cem\u003eCurtis Publishing Co. v. Butts\u003c/em\u003e concerns an article published in the March 23, 1963 edition of \u003cem\u003eThe Saturday Evening Post\u003c/em\u003e alleging that former University of Georgia football coach Wallace Butts conspired with University of Alabama coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant to fix a 1962 football game in Alabama\u0027s favor. The article\u0027s source was George Burnett, an Atlanta insurance salesman who had allegedly overheard a telephone conversation between the coaches. Butts brought and won a libel suit against Curtis Publishing, owner of the periodical. Soon after the Court\u0027s ruling in \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, Curtis moved for a new trial. The trial judge rejected the argument because Butts was not a public official. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial judge\u0027s decision on the basis that Curtis had waived any constitutional challenges by not raising such questions at trial. \u003cem\u003eAssociated Press v. Walker\u003c/em\u003e concerns dispatch reports of rioting that occurred on the campus of the University of Mississippi on September 30, 1962. The dispatches, authored by a correspondent on the scene, reported that Edwin A. Walker, a private citizen and political activist, had personally led a violent crowd attempting to prevent federal marshals from enforcing the court-ordered enrollment of an African-American. Walker denied the report, and filed a libel suit in the state courts of Texas. A jury found in Walker\u0027s favor, but the judge in the case refused to award punitive damages, finding that there was no malicious intent. The judge also specifically noted that \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e was inapplicable. On appeal, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals agreed. The Supreme Court of Texas declined to hear the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn light of the Court\u0027s ruling in \u003cem\u003eNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan\u003c/em\u003e, were the allegations made against Butts and Walker libelous?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 decision authored by Justice John M. Harlan, the Court noted significant differences between the circumstances of these cases and those of \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e. In particular, criticism of Butts or Walker, unlike a government official, could not be conflated with criticism of public policy. Thus, the Court reasoned that public figures who are not public officials may recover damages for libel stemming from false reports based on \"highly unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers.\" The Court concluded that Curtis\u0027 investigation of its allegations against Butts failed to meet this standard. The company printed a questionably reliable source\u0027s allegations without any attempt to verify his claims, and the story in question was not a pressing event or immediately newsworthy. The Court thus affirmed the lower courts\u0027 denial of a retrial.

The purpose of this amendment was to alert doctors and patients about identical drugs that sold under separate names at different prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe act delegated authority to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to publish proposed regulations designed to implement the statute. The Commissioner, George P. Larrick, published regulations mandating that drug manufacturers print the established drug name every time its corresponding proprietary name is used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbbott Laboratories brought suit against Anthony J. Celebrezze, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and Larrick under the Declaratory Judgment Act (\"DJA\") and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Abbott Laboratories argued that the \"every time\" rule was outside of the scope of the authority given to the commissioner by Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Judge Caleb M. Wright of the district court granted the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Abbott Labs, finding that the FFDCA did not permit the Commissioner\u0027s \"every time\" interpretation. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, reversed without touching upon the interpretation question. District court Judge Weber, writing for a unanimous court, held that Abbott Labs could not challenge the commissioner\u0027s rule under the DJA or APA. Abbott Laboratories and 37 other drug manufacturers appealed the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Congress authorize judicial review of the commissioner of the FDA\u0027s authority to require Abbott Laboratories to print the established name of a drug every time its proprietary name is used?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Writing for the majority in a 5-3 decision, Justice John Harlan wrote that where the legal issue is fit for judicial resolution and a regulation requires an immediate and significant change in plaintiffs\u0027 conduct with potentially serious penalties, the law permits access to the courts under the APA and the DJA. The Court found that congress did not intend to forbid pre-enforcement review of regulations like the \"every time\" rule. The legislature designed the statute\u0027s specific review provisions to provide additional remedies for parties in Abbott Laboratories\u0027 position, not to cut down traditional channels of review. The Court remanded the case to the court of appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abraham Fortas dissented, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Thomas Clark. He wrote that courts have jurisdiction over challenges to administrative action only when there is a specific statutory provision, when the agency acts unconstitutionally, or when it acts without jurisdiction. Justice Fortas feared that the majority\u0027s ruling would give federal district judges a \"roving commission to halt the regulatory process.\" He reviewed the legislative history of the FFDCA and found that congress had consistently reserved judicial review for specific situations not including the present case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clark wrote a separate dissent arguing that the commissioner was right to prevent drug manufacturers from misleading the public about the content of their proprietary drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25417,"name":"Gerhard A.

The Lovings returned to Virginia shortly thereafter. The couple was then charged with violating the state\u0027s antimiscegenation statute, which banned inter-racial marriages. The Lovings were found guilty and sentenced to a year in jail (the trial judge agreed to suspend the sentence if the Lovings would leave Virginia and not return for 25 years).\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Virginia\u0027s antimiscegenation law violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that distinctions drawn according to race were generally \"odious to a free people\" and were subject to \"the most rigid scrutiny\" under the Equal Protection Clause. The Virginia law, the Court found, had no legitimate purpose \"independent of invidious racial discrimination.\" The Court rejected the state\u0027s argument that the statute was legitimate because it applied equally to both blacks and whites and found that racial classifications were not subject to a \"rational purpose\" test under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also held that the Virginia law violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \"Under our Constitution,\" wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren, \"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17550,"name":"Bernard S.

Several competing gas companies attempted to intervene under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but the district court denied the motions.  The district court approved El Paso’s divestiture plan, under which El Paso would create a new company to receive all of the Pacific Northwest assets.  The gas companies again attempted to intervene, arguing that the divestiture plan would not create a valid competitor.  The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court err in denying California and the gas companies the right to intervene?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 5-2 decision, Justice William O. Douglas wrote the majority opinion reversing the district court.  The Supreme Court held that the gas companies had the right to intervene.  The Court also gave guidelines for the district court to follow in its new order for divestiture.  Justice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent, stating that private parties do not have the right to intervene in government antitrust suits.  Justice John M. Harlan joined in the dissent.  Justice Byron R.

In 1950, Afroyim went to Israel where he voted in that country\u0027s 1951 governmental elections. In 1960, Afroyim applied for renewal a of his American passport. The State Department informed him that he had forfeited his American citizenship by virtue of Section 401(e) of the 1940 Nationality Act which stipulates that citizens of the United States shall \"lose\" their citizenship upon voting in a foreign state\u0027s political elections. Afroyim challenged the constitutionality of Section 401(e). On appeal from a district court\u0027s summary judgment favoring Secretary of State Dean Rusk, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court granted Afroyim certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Section 401(e) of the 1940 Nationality Act, revoking U.S. citizenship to persons who vote in other countries\u0027 elections, violate either the Fifth Amendment right to Due Process or the Fourteenth Amendment, under which naturalized citizens are granted national citizenship?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 decision, overruling Perez v. Brownell (356 US 44), the Court held that Congress has no general power to revoke American citizenship without consent. Noting the special bond between Americans and their government, a bond that protects every citizen against all manner of destruction of their rights, the Court held that only citizens themselves may voluntarily relinquish their citizenship. This sacred principle applies equally to natural and naturalized citizens. As such, Section 401(e) violated both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15124,"title":"Oral Argument - February 20, 1967","unavailable":false,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15124"}],"citation":{"volume":"387","page":"253","year":"1967","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26052"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Two cab drivers were attracted by the yelling and followed the suspect onto Cocoa Lane. One of the cab drivers radioed the company dispatcher a description of the suspect including clothes, which the dispatcher passed on to the police. When the police arrived at the Hayden residence, Mrs. Hayden allowed them to search the house without a warrant. The police found Bennie Joe Hayden in an upstairs bedroom and no one else in the house. They also found a set of clothes matching the description given by the cab driver in the washing machine, as well as a shotgun and a pistol in a flush tank. Ammunition for both weapons was discovered in Hayden’s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayden was charged with armed robbery and tried in front of a court sitting without a jury. The clothing and the weapons were admitted into evidence at trial without objection, and Hayden was convicted. Hayden sought habeas corpus relief in district court, which was denied. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the denial of habeas corpus and held that the search was valid but that the clothing had “evidential value only” and was improperly admitted into evidence at trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment create a distinction between merely evidentiary materials, which may not be seized during the course of a search, and the instrumentalities or fruits of the crime, which may be seized?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that the language and purpose of the Fourth Amendment does not support such a distinction. Because the Fourth Amendment was meant to protect the privacy of citizens from being violated by the government, the type of property that is the subject of the search is irrelevant to the protection provided. Justice Hugo L. Black concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abe Fortas wrote a partial concurrence in which he argued that the Fourth Amendment limits the scope of searches to those items which can be directly tied to the commission of a crime. He also argued that the protection against general searches is a fundamental aspect of the Fourth Amendment, and the majority’s opinion damages that protection. Chief Justice Earl Warren joined in the partial concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the Fourth Amendment provides protection of both privacy and property.

In his defense, Spevack claimed his constitutional right against self-incrimination, and stated that the records and testimony would tend to incriminate him. The New York appellate court rejected Spevack\u0027s defense and ordered Spevack disbarred, holding that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not available to attorneys against states.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment applicable against states when the person claiming the right against self-incrimination is an attorney?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William O. Douglas wrote the plurality opinion of the Court reversing the lower court\u0027s decision. Writing for himself and three other justices, Douglas maintained that the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment is applicable against states because the Fourteenth Amendment prevents states from interfering with the rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, including the right to remain silent without suffering a penalty. This protection extends to lawyers, and Spevack should have been able to assert his right against self-incrimination without being penalized by the dishonor of disbarment and the deprivation of his livelihood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abe Fortas voted with the majority but wrote a special concurrence distinguishing between a lawyer\u0027s right to remain silent, which he acknowledged, and that of a public employee, who could be questioned about his official duties without the self-incrimination protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Marshall Harlan II dissented, joined by Justices Tom Clark and Potter Stewart. Harlan wrote that the State of New York had the authority to impose valid conditions on the authority to practice law and to assess qualifications for continued practice. He concluded that the plurality improperly invalidated New York\u0027s rules by reversing Spevack\u0027s disbarment and determined that protection from disbarment for failure to provide information to a judicial inquiry went beyond the scope of the right against self-incrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15114,"title":"Oral Argument - November 07, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15114"}],"citation":{"volume":"385","page":"511","year":"1967","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26081"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

At trial, Washington alleged that Charles Fuller, already convicted for the same murder, actually shot the victim while Washington attempted to stop the shooting.  Washington claimed that Fuller would testify to these facts, but the prosecution objected based on a state statute that prevented persons charged in the same crime from testifying on behalf of one another.  Washington argued that refusing to allow Fuller to testify violated his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process for obtaining a witness in his favor.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is the Sixth Amendment compulsory process clause applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does a state statute prohibiting persons charged together in the same crime from testifying for each other violate the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, Yes.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for eight members of the court, reversed the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process is so fundamental that it is incorporated in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Washington was denied that right in this case.  Justice John M. Harlan concurred in the result, writing that Washington’s right to due process was violated, but the compulsory process clause played no role in his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20225,"name":"Charles W.

After a hearing, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts denied the application, finding that Berenyi gave false testimony to facilitate his naturalization, so he was not a person of “good moral character.” In Berenyi’s application, he denied membership in the Communist Party, but two witnesses testified that Berenyi often spoke of his Party membership and lead a study group on Marxist-Leninist ideology. Berenyi appealed, arguing that the government failed to show that he had a “meaningful association” with the Communist Party. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the court of appeals err in upholding the district court’s finding that Berenyi was a member of the Communist party without evidence that the membership was a “meaningful association”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a 6-3 majority, affirmed the First Circuit. The Supreme Court held that it could not review a factual finding by two lower courts without an obvious and exceptional showing of error. The record gave no indication that the district court or the court of appeals made such an error. Justice William O. Douglas dissented, arguing that the district court’s finding was clearly erroneous based on other evidence presented at the naturalization hearing. Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William J.

A. Parker of second-degree murder and sentenced him to the Oregon State Penitentiary for a potential maximum of the remainder of his life. The Supreme Court of Oregon affirmed his conviction, and denied a rehearing on October 8, 1963. During the trial, the bailiff stated to Mrs. Gattman, an alternate juror, “Oh, that wicked fellow, he is guilty.” Misses Inwards and Drake, both regular jurors, overheard this statement. Parker was not aware of these statements during the trial, and consequently did not bring them to the attention of the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, Parker gave his wife a tape recording and asked her to contact members of the jury to find new grounds for setting aside his conviction. Mrs. Parker secured the names of the jurors and contacted three, Misses Inwards, Drake and Gattman. Mrs. Gattman was an alternate juror who expressed her displeasure with the verdict to Mrs. Parker. Mrs. Inwards gave conflicting testimony in an affidavit; she initially testified that the bailiffs’ statements did not influence her testimony, but later stated that the remarks could have affected her decision. Mrs. Gattman was the only juror who was sure of the bailiffs’ statements, and later admitted that she was disturbed by the verdict. Mrs. Drake gave an account of the bailiff’s statements that conflicted with Mrs. Gattman’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker filed for post-conviction relief. The post-conviction trial court held that the trial court would have granted a new trial if it had been aware of the bailiff’s statements. The Oregon Supreme Court reversed, holding that the trial court erroneously applied the statutory standard for judging a motion for a new trial under the Oregon Post Conviction Act. It also held that the bailiff’s statements did not violate Parker’s state or federal constitutional rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Parker’s right to due process violated when a bailiff told two jurors, “Oh, that wicked fellow, he is guilty”, and “If you find him guilty and there is anything wrong, the Supreme Court will correct it”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam decision with one dissent, the Court held that the bailiff\u0027s statements violated Parker’s right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to trial by an impartial jury. The Court noted that there was no dispute over what the bailiff said, nor any dispute over whether he was subjected to confrontation, cross-examination or other constitutional safeguards. The Court held that the bailiff’s speech was private talk tending to reach the jury by outside influence. The Court rejected the government’s argument that no prejudice was shown because ten members of the jury testified that they did not hear the bailiff’s statement, pointing to one juror’s testimony that she was prejudiced by the bailiff’s statements. The Court also noted the official character of the bailiff\u0027s role with the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan dissented, disagreeing that the Sixth Amendment was directly applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. He rejected the Court’s assumption that jurors must be absolutely insulated from all expressions of opinion on the merits of cases, citing cases where the Court refused to overthrow a verdict despite jury contact with outside information. He also questioned the evidence of Mrs. Inwards’ prejudice, ascribing her claims of prejudicial influence to post-conviction guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32923,"name":"John H.

By 1923, however, some 19 independent factories operated under Sealy licenses. Soon thereafter, these licensees and new owner E. E. Edwards formed the Sealy Corporation. Sealy continued to license the use of the Sealy mark to independent stock-holding bedding manufacturers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1925, the licensees agreed on a system of allocating exclusive territories to market Sealy products. Each manufacturer had an exclusive territory in his license contract; this contract prohibited each manufacturer from selling outside of that territory. Around this time, the licensee-stockholders and Sealy began collaborating to fix and police the minimum and maximum prices charged by retailers of Sealy products, the advertised prices of Sealy products, and the means of inducing retailers to adhere to these prices. In 1933, Sealy Corporation reorganized into Sealy, Incorporated. Sealy, Inc. made a new provision that any new manufacturers coming into the organization must purchase Sealy stock. In the 1940’s, Sealy’s business increased and many new licensees joined to cover previously open territories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sherman Act provided that every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce was illegal. The United States brought a civil action against Sealy, Inc. charging that it violated the Sherman Act by setting minimum retail prices and by forcing retailers to adhere to those prices. It also alleged that Sealy, Inc.’s exclusive territorial arrangements violated the Sherman Act. The district court held that Sealy, Inc.’s price fixing violated the Sherman Act, but that its territorial arrangements did not. The United States appealed the district court’s ruling on the legality of Sealy, Inc.’s licensing structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Sealy’s method of allocating territorial manufacturing licenses violate the Sherman Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-1 decision written by Justice Abraham Fortas, the Court held that Sealy’s licensing structure was a horizontal restraint of trade, a per se violation of the Sherman Act. He noted that the licensees controlled the day-to-day business of Sealy through the board of directors and the executive committee, including the grant, assignment, reassignment, and termination of exclusive territorial licenses. Justice Fortas held that Sealy’s behavior was an aggregation of trade restraints, reasoning that Sealy’s territorial restraints were a part of its admittedly unlawful price fixing scheme. While acknowledging that the territorial limitations served other purposes, he reasoned that their connection to price fixing was enough to require they be condemned as an unlawful restraint of trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan dissented. He argued that Sealy’s territorial licensing structure was a vertical arrangement not prohibited by the Sherman Act. He described the main purpose of Sealy’s licensing structure as the proper exploitation of the Sealy name and trademarks by licensed bedding manufacturers. Justice Harlan argued that the territorial restrictions were secondary or ancillary to that purpose. He rejected the majority’s theory that Sealy’s actions were an aggregation of trade restraints, noting that the district court did not address the reasonableness of Sealy’s territorial arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Tom Clark and Byron White took no part in the decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20837,"name":"Daniel M.

The inspector claimed that the occupancy permit for the property did not allow residential use of the first floor.  The search was a routine annual inspection.  Camara refused to let the inspector enter the building without a warrant.  The inspector returned two more times without a warrant, and Camara turned him away.  About a month after the first visit, Camara was arrested and charged with violation of the San Francisco Housing Code (SFHC) for refusing to allow the inspection.  Camara sought a writ of prohibition, arguing that the section of the SFHC that authorized the inspection violated Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Superior Court of California denied the writ, the District Court of Appeals affirmed and the Supreme Court of California denied a petition for hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo §503 of the SFHC, which authorizes inspection of private dwellings without a warrant, and §507, which makes it a crime to refuse such an inspection, violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 6-3 majority, vacated the lower judgment.  The Supreme Court held that Camara had a constitutional right to insist that the inspector obtain a warrant before searching his home.  He also cannot be convicted for refusing to consent to the inspection.  This decision overruled \u003ci\u003eFrank v. Maryland\u0026lt;./i\u0026gt;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C.

At approximately 2:00 A.M. the following day, Chapman and Teale appeared at the Spot Club in Lodi. The only persons at the bar were Teale, Chapman, and the club’s bartender, Billy Dean Adcock. A short time later, a witness observed three persons in front of the Spot Club: a woman of Chapman’s general description and Adcock stood in front of the club’s door, while a man resembling Teale stood behind Adcock while he apparently locked the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, the Spot Club’s owner found the club in disarray; someone had broken into the cash register and approximately $260 was missing. Routine housekeeping tasks normally performed by Adcock were left undone. Later, Adcock body’s was found in a remote area north of Lodi, half buried in an open roadside ditch. The time of death was approximately 3:00 AM on October 18th. Adcock was shot three times in the head. The bullets were fired from a .22 caliber weapon similar to one purchased by Chapman while with Teale in Reno, Nevada, six days before the killing. The gun was not found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficers arrested Teale in New Orleans on November 2, 1962. He carried a gun purchased the same day as Chapman’s .22 caliber weapon. An agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Chapman in St. Joseph, Missouri on October 26, 1962. She gave conflicting accounts of her whereabouts on October 17 and 18, but a registration card from October 18 for occupancy of a motel room in Woodland, California was made out in her handwriting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapman and Teale were charged with the first degree murder of Adcock. A prisoner locked up with Teale testified that Teale did not plan on killing Adcock, but when Chapman and Teale released Adcock from their car outside of Lodi, Chapman shot him once in the back of the head and twice more when he was on the ground. Neither defendant appeared as a witness, but Chapman’s conflicting testimony was introduced by direct examination of the FBI agent. The trial court instructed the jury that they could draw adverse conclusions from the defendants’ failure to testify. The jury convicted both defendants of first degree murder. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court held in \u003ci\u003eGriffin v. State of California\u003c/i\u003e that California’s practice of allowing prosecutors to use defendants’ silence against them violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. On appeal, however, the California Supreme Court held that the unconstitutional jury instruction was a harmless error because it did not result in a miscarriage of justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Are all federal constitutional errors harmful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did it constitute a harmless constitutional error when prosecutors improperly commented on Chapman and Teale’s failure to testify?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In an 8-1 decision written by Justice Hugo Black, the Court affirmed that there may be some constitutional errors so unimportant and insignificant that they are harmless. Justice Black noted that all fifty states have harmless error statutes or rules, and that Congress established a longstanding rule for federal courts that judgments should not be reversed for errors that do not affect parties’ substantial rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Black determined that federal law must govern the application of a state harmless error rule; the Court cannot leave the formulation of rules protecting individuals from invasion by the states to those very same states. Justice Black then cited the holding from \u003ci\u003eFahy v. State of Connecticut\u003c/i\u003e, where the Court determined that an error is harmful if there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction. Here, the prosecution repeatedly told the jury that by their silence Chapman and Teale had served as irrefutable witnesses against themselves; absent these comments, reasonable jurors might well have returned a not-guilty verdict. Thus, the state had not demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutions’ comments did not contribute to Chapman and Teale’s conviction, and the error was harmful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart concurred, noting that the Court previously reversed all convictions of guilt when defendants had given involuntary confessions at trial. Justice Stewart rejected the notion that such constitutional violations could ever be harmless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan dissented, arguing that the state appellate court reasonably applied California’s harmless error rule to sustain Chapman and Teale’s conviction, and that California’s harmless error rule was consistent with the guarantee of fundamental fairness in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Justice Harlan rejected the majority’s assumption of a general supervisory power over the trial of federal constitutional issues, finding no source for that power in the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36190,"name":"Morris Lavine","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/morris_lavine","view_count":0,"last_name":"Lavine","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"morris_lavine"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22051"},{"advocate":{"ID":42947,"name":"Thomas C.
