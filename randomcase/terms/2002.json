At the time of his arrest, Ewing was on parole from a 9-year prison term for convictions in three burglaries and one robbery. Under California\u0027s three strikes law, another felony conviction would require a sentence of 25 years to life. Ewing was charged with and convicted of one count of felony grand theft for the incident at the golf course. During sentencing, Ewing requested the judge in the case exercise discretion permitted under California law and reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor. The judge declined and sentenced Ewing in accordance with the three strikes law. On appeal, Ewing argued the sentence of 25 years to life was grossly disproportionate to the crime and therefore a violation of the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishments. The court, reasoning that the three strikes law served the state\u0027s legitimate interests, rejected this claim. The California Supreme Court declined to hear the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Ewing\u0027s sentence of 25 years to life, in accordance with California\u0027s three strikes law, violate the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 plurality decision authored by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court, relying heavily on its decision in \u003cem\u003eRummel v. Estelle\u003c/em\u003e (1980), concluded that Ewing\u0027s long history of legal offenses justified his conviction. In \u003cem\u003eRummel\u003c/em\u003e, the Court had ruled that a sentence of life with the possibility of parole was valid for three convictions of fraud, check forgery, and theft. In that case, the Court gave great deference to legislatures in mandating sentences for repeat offenders. Justice O\u0027Connor writes that, as in \u003cem\u003eRummel\u003c/em\u003e, Ewing\u0027s conviction reflects \"rational legislative judgment\" and \"is justified by the State\u0027s public-safety interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35610,"name":"Michael Chertoff","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/michael_chertoff","view_count":0,"last_name":"Chertoff","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"michael_chertoff"},"advocate_description":"for United States, as amicus curiae, supporting the Respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18161"},{"advocate":{"ID":38478,"name":"Quin Denvir","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/quin_denvir","view_count":0,"last_name":"Denvir","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"quin_denvir"},"advocate_description":"on behalf of the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18162"},{"advocate":{"ID":21309,"name":"Donald E.

State Farm assured the Campbells that they would represent their interests. After losing in court, the Campbells sued State Farm for bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In the first part of the trial, the jury found State Farm\u0027s decision not to settle unreasonable. In the second part, the trial court denied State Farm\u0027s renewed motion to exclude dissimilar out-of-state conduct evidence, ruling such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farm\u0027s conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages. The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively. The Utah Supreme Court reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs an award of $145 million in punitive damages, when full compensatory damages are $1 million, excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that the punitive award of $145 million was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was thus an irrational, arbitrary, and unconstitutional deprivation of the property of the insurer. The Court reasoned that evidence of dissimilar out-of-state misconduct was an improper basis for punishing the insurer for the limited harm and noted, \"few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.\" Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. Justices Scalia and Thomas argued that the Due Process Clause provides no substantive protections against excessive or unreasonable awards of punitive damages. Justice Ginsburg noted that the decision overstepped states\u0027 traditional territory to regulate punitive damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41083,"name":"Sheila L.

The gins claimed that Entergy had failed to notify them of a lower rate that would have saved them more than $2 million over the six-year period. Louisiana law requires that utility companies notify customers when they are eligible for a lower rate. Furthermore, the gins claimed that Entergy had discriminated against them by notifying several other gins in the state of the lower rate. Deferring to the decision of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, the state\u0027s utility regulatory agency, a state district court ruled against Entergy. The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed the decision on appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved tariff that delegates discretion to the regulated entity to determine the precise cost allocation similarly preempt a state order that adjudges those costs imprudent?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that the LPSC\u0027s order was preempted by the filed rate doctrine articulated in Nantahala Power \u0026amp; Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U.S. 953, and Mississippi Power \u0026amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354. Applying Nantahala and MP\u0026amp;L;, the Court reasoned that the LPSC\u0027s order impermissibly \"traps\" costs that have been allocated in a FERC tariff. The Court noted that it did not matter whether the FERC has spoken to the precise classification of ERS units, but only whether the FERC tariff dictates how and by whom that classification should be made. \"The amended system agreement clearly does so, and therefore the LPSC\u0027s second-guessing of the classification of ERS units is pre-empted,\" wrote Justice Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20717,"name":"David W.

The police discovered that she had been having a sexual relationship with her 19-year-old half-brother, who had been with Robert Kaupp on the day of the girl’s disappearance. The police questioned the girl’s half-brother and Kaupp at police headquarters and allowed Kaupp to leave. The half-brother later confessed to stabbing the missing girl and implicated Kaupp in the crime. The police failed to obtain a warrant to question Kaupp, but they went to his home in the middle of the night and were given permission to enter by Kaupp’s father. Police officers awakened Kaupp and said, “We need to go and talk,” and Kaupp responded, “Okay.” Wearing only his pajamas and no shoes, Kaupp was handcuffed and taken for questioning. There is no evidence that Kaupp was told he could decline to go with the officers for questioning. Kaupp was read his Miranda rights at the police station and, after being informed of the half-brother’s confession, admitted to some involvement in the crime. At trial, Kaupp moved to suppress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest. The motion was denied, and Kaupp was convicted of murder and sentenced to 55 years in prison. The Texas Court of Appeals confirmed the district court’s conviction and held that no arrest had occurred until after Kaupp’s confession because Kaupp’s statement indicated that he consented to going with the officers. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied discretionary review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Does an arrest for which the police did not obtain a warrant and in which it was not clear that the suspect could decline to go with the police violate the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. If so, should the subsequent confession be suppressed?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eAn arrest within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment occurs when a reasonable person would not feel free to ignore the police and go about his business, and such an arrest requires probable cause. A confession that results from an illegal arrest must be suppressed unless the conditions of the confession indicated it was not influenced by the illegal arrest. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that an arrest within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment occurred and that Kaupp’s conduct was not consent sufficient to overcome the probable cause requirement. Although he received the Miranda warnings, the warnings were insufficient to constitute an intervening event that could remove the influence of the illegal arrest when all the other conditions of the illegal arrest, such as Kaupp’s partially clothed state and the presence of the officers who arrested him, remained present. Thus, Kaupp’s confession in this case should have been suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"538","page":"626","year":"2003","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/18962"},"decisions":[{"description":"The confession should have been suppressed.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15141,"name":"William H.

Rehnquist, the Court held, 6-3, that the Immigration and Nationality Act does not deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction to grant habeas relief to aliens challenging their detention under section 1226(c) and, 5-4, that detention during removal proceedings is a constitutionally permissible part of that process. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that Congress, concerned that deportable criminal aliens may fail to appear for their removal hearings, has the authority to require that persons be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, dissented from the first holding, reasoning that the Act deprives federal courts of jurisdiction in such a case. Justice David H. Souter, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer dissented from the Court\u0027s second holding. The minority argued against the Court\u0027s approval of lengthy mandatory detention.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32519,"name":"Judy Rabinovitz","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/judy_rabinovitz","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rabinovitz","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"judy_rabinovitz"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18178"},{"advocate":{"ID":43165,"name":"Theodore B.

Nike responded to the charges in numerous ways, such as by issuing press releases. In 1998, Marc Kasky, a California resident, sued Nike for unfair and deceptive practices under California\u0027s Unfair Competition Law. Kasky alleged that Nike made \"false statements and/or material omissions of fact\" concerning the working conditions under which its products are manufactured. Nike filed a demurrer, contending that Kasky\u0027s suit was absolutely barred by the First Amendment. The trial court dismissed the case and the California Court of Appeal affirmed. In reversing, the California Supreme Court found that Nike\u0027s messages were commercial speech, but that the suit was at such a preliminary stage that the issue whether any false representations had been made had yet to be resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a corporation participating in a public debate be subjected to liability for factual inaccuracies on the theory that its statements are commercial speech because they might affect consumers\u0027 opinions about the business as a good corporate citizen and thereby affect their purchasing decisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court did not answer the question dismissing the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy dissented. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, dissented. Justice Breyer argued that no jurisdictional rule prevented the Court from decided the case and that \"delay itself may inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights of free speech without making the issue significantly easier to decide later on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35187,"name":"Laurence H.

To be eligible for funding, a state must undertake a thorough evaluation of its public roads. This led to concerns that the absence of confidentiality would increase the liability risk for accidents that took place at hazardous locations before improvements could be made. Ultimately, Congress provided that materials \"compiled or collected\" for purposes of the program \"shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State court proceeding.\" In 1996, Ignacio Guillen\u0027s wife died in an automobile accident in a Pierce County, Washington intersection. While Washington had previously been denied funding for the intersection where the accident occurred, its second request was granted after the accident. Guillen first sought information on the intersection and then asserted that the state had been negligent in failing to install proper traffic controls. Washington sought to protect itself under the Program. The Washington Supreme Court held that the Program exceeded Congress\u0027s power under the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Hazard Elimination Program exceed Congress\u0027s authority under the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Clarence Thomas, the Court held that both the original program and its subsequent amendments fall within Congress\u0027s Commerce Clause power to \"\u0027regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce\u0027\" and \"\u0027to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce.\u0027\" The Court concluded that, because Congress could reasonably believe that adopting a measure eliminating an unforeseen side effect of the Program\u0027s information-gathering requirement would result in greater safety on the nation\u0027s roads, the legislation was aimed at improving safety in the channels of commerce and increasing protections for the instrumentalities of interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

Attorneys for Breuer\u0027s employer, Jim\u0027s Concrete of Brevard, had the case moved to federal court by citing the federal removal statute. According to the statute, defendants in state court cases dealing with federal laws may have the case moved to federal court \"unless otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress.\" Breuer\u0027s attorney argued that Congress had provided for suits under the FLSA to be heard in state court and that the case should therefore be returned to state court; attorneys for Jim\u0027s Concrete disagreed. The district court refused to send the case back to state court. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn providing for suits under the FLSA, did Congress bar removal of such actions from state to federal court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered David H. Souter, the Court held that the FLSA does not bar removal of a suit from state to federal court, thus Breuer\u0027s case was properly removed under section 1441. The Court reasoned that nothing on the face of the FLSA looked like an express prohibition of removal, there being no mention of removal, let alone of prohibition, given that word \"maintain\" and its bearing on removal was ambiguous at best. Rejecting all of Breuer\u0027s arguments, the Court noted that numerous other statutes provided indisputable prohibitions of removal, which demonstrated Congress\u0027s intent to give plaintiffs an absolute choice of forum in unmistakable terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34185,"name":"Lisa S.

The Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions on November 23, 1998, the court\u0027s mandate issued on December 15, 1998, and Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari. One year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate, and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expired, Clay filed a motion for postconviction relief under 28 USC section 2255. Section 2255 provides that such motions are subject to a one-year time limitation that runs from \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" The District Court stated that when a federal prisoner does not seek certiorari, his judgment of conviction becomes final for section 2255 purposes upon issuance of the court of appeals\u0027s mandate. Because Clay filed his motion more than one year after that date, the court denied it as time barred. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a judgment become \"final\" for postconviction relief when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction where a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from the U.S. Supreme Court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that, for the purpose of starting the clock on section 2255\u0027s one-year limitation period, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court\u0027s affirmation of the conviction. Under this rule, Clay\u0027s section 2255 motion was timely filed. After comparing the understanding of finality for collateral review purposes to the meaning of the phrase \"becomes final\" in 28 USC section 2255, the Court rejected the standard that the issuance of the appellate court mandate is the triggering date.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36594,"name":"Matthew D.

Under this system, some States discounted or waived registration fees for carriers from other States in exchange for reciprocal treatment. Under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the ICC implemented a new registration system. ISTEA also capped state registration fees by establishing a fee system that \"will result in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee?that such State collected or charged as of?1991.\" In 1991, the Michigan Public Service Commission did not levy a fee for Yellow Transportation, Inc.\u0027s trucks pursuant to a reciprocal agreement. However, in 1992, the commission changed how it computed fees and, ultimately, levied a fee of $10 per vehicle on Yellow Transportation\u0027s entire fleet. Yellow Transportation sued, alleging that, because Michigan had not collected or charged a 1991 registration fee for those trucks, ISTEA\u0027s fee-cap provision prohibits Michigan from levying a fee for them. The Michigan Supreme Court concluded that reciprocity agreements are not relevant in determining what fee a State charged or collected as of 1991. The court reasoned that the new fee system is not based on the fees collected from one company, but at the generic fee Michigan charged or collected from carriers as of 1991.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Michigan Supreme Court err in holding that, under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, only a State\u0027s generic fee is relevant to determining the fee that was collected or charged as of November 15, 1991?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 9-0 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that, because the ICC\u0027s interpretation of ISTEA\u0027s fee-cap provision that States may not renounce or modify a reciprocity agreement so as to alter any fee charged or collected as of that date was permissible reading, the Michigan Supreme Court erred in declining to enforce it. \"Under the ICC\u0027s rule, where a State waives its registration fee, its \u0027fee?collected or charged\u0027 is zero and must remain zero,\" wrote Justice O\u0027Connor. Justice O\u0027Connor concluded,\" to allow States to disavow their reciprocity agreements so as to alter any fee charged or collected as of November 15, 1991, would potentially permit States to increase their revenues substantially under the new system, a result that the ICC quite reasonably believed Congress did not intend.\" Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42549,"name":"Thomas L.

The OUA also considers race and admits virtually every qualified applicant from certain groups determined to be “underrepresented minorities.” Beginning in 1998, the OUA used a point system in which students were awarded an additional 20 points for being a member of an underrepresented minority, and beginning in 1999, the University established an Admissions Review Committee to provide an additional level of consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1995, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both applied for admission to the University of Michigan’ College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the state of Michigan. Both are of Caucasian descent. Both were denied admission and told that, although they were qualified, they were not competitive enough applicants to be admitted on first review. In October 1997, Gratz and Hamacher filed a class action suit against the University, the LSA, Lee Bollinger, and James Duderstadt. They argued that the admission procedure discriminated against certain racial and ethnic groups in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court held that the respondents had shown that a racially and ethnically diverse student body produced significant academic benefits but that the admission policies of 1995-1998 were problematic because they amounted to “holding seats” for certain minority groups. Therefore, the court granted summary judgment for the petitioners with respect to the admissions policies for 1995-1998 and for the respondents with respect to the policy that began in 1999. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit heard this case the same day as \u003cem\u003eGrutter v. Bollinger\u003c/em\u003e, a similar case, and upheld the University’s admission policies in that case. The petitioners in this case then asked the Court to grant certiorari, despite the lack of opinion from the lower court, to resolve the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the University of Michigan’s use of racial preferences in undergraduate admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the OUA’s policies were not sufficiently narrowly tailored to meet the strict scrutiny standard. Because the policy did not provide individual consideration, but rather resulted in the admission of nearly every applicant of “underrepresented minority” status, it was not narrowly tailored in the manner required by previous jurisprudence on the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her concurring opinion, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote that the record showed that the only individualized consideration in the admissions process came through the Admissions Review Committee. Because the Committee played only a small part in the overall admissions process, it was not sufficient to satisfy the strict scrutiny standard. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he argued that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits any racial discrimination for the purposes of higher education admission. The admission policy in question failed because it did not allow for sufficient consideration of non-racial factors in determining the admissibility of a candidate from an underrepresented minority group. In his separate opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that, in cases dealing with the Equal Protection Clause, the Court should distinguish between policies of inclusion and policies of exclusion because the former are much more likely to prove consistent with the intent of the Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that, because neither of the petitioners could receive any benefit from the relief being requested, precedent required that the case be dismissed. While they are entitled to relief for past wrongs, they cannot seek injunctive relief to prevent future harms to other parties. Justice David Souter joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Souter wrote that, by making race only one of a number of factors to be considered, the admissions policy meets the requirements established by previous Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence. Because the point system and the Admissions Review Committee operate in conjunction with each other, there cannot be the “holding of seats” phenomenon that the majority opinion fears. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined in the dissent. Justice Ginsburg also wrote a separate dissenting opinion in which she argued that, because there is no evidence that the OUA policies attempt to limit or decrease enrollment by any particular racial or ethnic group and there is no evidence of saving seats, the policies do not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Racial information about an applicant can be useful in admission considerations because it often serves to show what a student has accomplished and why the student is worthy of admission. Justice Souter joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33878,"name":"Kirk O.

He was found guilty. O\u0027Mara pleaded guilty to charges of violating the statute, but reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality. In Elliott\u0027s trial, the judge did not give an instruction on the statute\u0027s prima facie evidence provision. Ultimately, the Virginia Supreme Court held, among other things, that the cross-burning statute is unconstitutional on its face and that the prima facie evidence provision renders the statute overbroad because the probability of prosecution under the statute chills the expression of protected speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Commonwealth of Virginia\u0027s cross-burning statute, which prohibits the burning of a cross with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, but in a plurality opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that while a State, consistent with the First Amendment, may ban cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate, in which four other justices joined, the provision in the Virginia statute treating any cross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate renders the statute unconstitutional in its current form, in which three other justices joined. Justice Antonin Scalia left the latter portion of the Court\u0027s conclusion to argue that the Court should vacate and remand the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court with respect to Elliott and O\u0027Mara, so that that court could have an opportunity to construe the cross-burning statute\u0027s prima-facie-evidence provision. Justice David H. Souter, joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, concluded that the Virginia statute is unconstitutional and therefore concurred in the Court\u0027s judgment insofar as it affirmed the invalidation of Black\u0027s conviction. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40578,"name":"Rodney A.

Subsequently, the Archers sued the Warners for fraud connected with the sale. In settling the lawsuit, the Archers executed releases except for obligations under a $100,000 promissory note and then voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit. After the Warners failed to make the first payment on the promissory note, the Archers sued in state court. The Warners filed for bankruptcy, and the Bankruptcy Court ordered liquidation under Chapter 7. The Archers then brought a claim asking the Bankruptcy Court to find the $100,000 debt nondischargeable and to order the Warners to pay the sum. The Bankruptcy Code provides that a debt shall not be dischargeable in bankruptcy \"to the extent\" it is \"for money...obtained by...false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\" The Bankruptcy Court denied the Archers\u0027 claim. The District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Bankruptcy Code cover a debt embodied in a settlement agreement that settled a creditor\u0027s earlier claim \"for money...obtained by...fraud?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that a debt for money promised in a settlement agreement accompanied by the release of underlying tort claims can amount to a debt for money obtained by fraud, within the nondischargeability statute\u0027s terms. \"We conclude that the Archers\u0027 settlement agreement and releases may have worked a kind of novation, but that fact does not bar the Archers from showing that the settlement debt arose out of \u0027false pretences, a false representation, or actual fraud,\u0027 and consequently is nondischargeable,\" wrote Justice Breyer.

The FCC asserted that NextWave\u0027s licenses had been canceled automatically when the company missed its first payment-deadline and announced that NextWave\u0027s licenses were available for auction. Ultimately, when the FCC denied NextWave\u0027s petition for reconsideration of the license cancellation, the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit held that the cancellation violated 11 USC section 525(a), which provides that a \"governmental unit may not...revoke...a license...to...a debtor...solely because such...debtor...has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in the case.\" (Together with No. 01-657, Arctic Slope Regional Corp. et al. v. NextWave Personal Communications Inc. et al.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from revoking licenses held by a debtor in bankruptcy upon the debtor\u0027s failure to make timely payments owed to the FCC for purchase of the licenses?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that the FCC\u0027s cancellations of the licenses violated section 525(a) as revocations of government licenses solely for nonpayment of the debtors\u0027 dischargeable debts. The Court rejected the FCC\u0027s argument that it did not revoke NextWave\u0027s licenses solely because of nonpayment and noted that the fact that the FCC had a valid regulatory motive for its action was irrelevant. Justice Scalia reasoned that, because the statute refers to failure to pay a debt as the sole cause of cancellation, it cannot reasonably be understood to include the governmental unit\u0027s motive in effecting the cancellation, since such a reading would deprive section 525 of force. Justice John Paul Stevens filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Stephen G. Breyer authored a dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

When Mexican officials stopped his vehicle at the border, they found ammunition, and Bean was subsequently convicted in a Mexican court of importing ammunition. Because of his felony conviction, 18 USC section 922(g)(1) prohibited Bean from possessing, distributing, or receiving firearms or ammunition. Bean applied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for relief from his firearms disabilities, but the ATF returned the application unprocessed, explaining that its annual appropriations law forbade it from expending any funds to investigate or act upon applications such as Bean\u0027s. Bean then filed suit, asking the District Court to conduct its own inquiry into his fitness to possess a gun and grant relief from his inability to possess, distribute, or receive firearms or ammunition. The court granted the requested relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a federal district court, despite appropriation provisions barring the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms from acting on applications for relief from firearms disabilities from persons convicted of a felony, have the authority to grant such relief?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that the absence of an actual denial of Bean\u0027s petition by ATF precludes judicial review. Because Bean\u0027s application for relief from the firearms disabilities was not considered due to appropriation provisions, Justice Thomas reasoned that the court could not grant relief since the statute only permitted judicial review of an affirmative denial of an application. \"The text of [section 925(c)] and the procedure it lays out for seeking relief make clear that an actual decision by ATF on an application is a prerequisite for judicial review, and that mere inaction by ATF does not invest a district court with independent jurisdiction to act on an application,\" wrote Justice Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

The customers alleged that the bank charged excessive interest in violation of Alabama law. The bank asked that the case be heard in federal, rather than state, court, because the issues were covered under the National Bank Act (NBA), a federal law. The district court ruled in favor of the bank; the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the NBA did not completely preempt state laws governing lending rates and that the case could therefore be heard in state court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the NBA require that any suits involving charges of excessive interest be heard in federal rather than state court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that the National Bank Act preempted the state-law claim and provided the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks. Thus, the claim arose under federal law. The Court reasoned that the provisions of the Act create a federal remedy for overcharges that is exclusive, even when a state complainant relies entirely on state law. \"Because [sections of the Act] provide the exclusive cause of action for such claims, there is, in short, no such thing as a state-law claim of usury against a national bank,\" wrote Justice Stevens.

In 1997, the Richmond City Council conveyed Whitcomb Court\u0027s streets to the RRHA. Subsequently, the RRHA enacted a policy authorizing the Richmond police to serve notice on any person lacking \"a legitimate business or social purpose\" for being on the premises and to arrest for trespassing any person who remains or returns after having been notified. After the RRHA gave Kevin Hicks, a nonresident, written notice barring him from Whitcomb Court, he trespassed there and was arrested and convicted. At trial, Hicks claimed that RRHA\u0027s policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. The Virginia en banc Court of Appeals vacated his conviction. In affirming, the Virginia Supreme Court found the policy unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority\u0027s trespass policy, which provides for arrest after being served notice for being on the premises without \"a legitimate business or social purpose,\" facially invalid under the First Amendment\u0027s overbreadth doctrine?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that the RRHA\u0027s trespass policy is not facially invalid under the First Amendment\u0027s overbreadth doctrine. Noting that he was not in Whitcomb Court to engage in constitutionally protected speech, the Court reasoned that Hicks had not shown that the RRHA policy prohibited a substantial amount of protected speech in relation to its many legitimate applications. Justice Scalia wrote, \"both the notice-barment rule and the \u0027legitimate business or social purpose\u0027 rule apply to all persons who enter the streets of Whitcomb Court, not just to those who seek to engage in expression.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45023,"name":"William H.

Although Sell has a long history of mental illness and was initially found competent to stand trial for fraud and attempted murder, a Federal Magistrate Judge ordered his hospitalization to determine whether he would attain the capacity to allow his trial to proceed. Subsequently, the Magistrate authorized forced administration of antipsychotic drugs. In affirming, the District Court concluded that medication was the only viable hope of rendering Sell competent to stand trial and was necessary to serve the Federal Government\u0027s interest in obtaining an adjudication of his guilt or innocence. The Court of Appeals affirmed. On the fraud charges, the appellate court found that the Federal Government had an essential interest in bringing Sell to trial, that the treatment was medically appropriate, and that the medical evidence indicated that Sell would fairly be able to participate in his trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay the Federal Government administer antipsychotic drugs involuntarily to a mentally ill criminal defendant in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial for serious, but nonviolent, crimes?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that the Constitution allows the Federal Government to administer antipsychotic drugs, even against the defendant\u0027s will, in limited circumstances. The Court reasoned that such conditions include if the treatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the trial\u0027s fairness, and, taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests. Finding that the District Court and Court of Appeals\u0027s findings did not satisfy these conditions, the Court vacated the appellate court\u0027s judgment. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, dissented, arguing that the Court did not have jurisdiction to decide the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18059,"name":"Barry A.

The Holleys, an interracial couple, alleged that a Triad real-estate corporation sales representative prevented them from buying a Triad-listed house for racially discriminatory reasons. The Holleys filed suit against the sales representative and David Meyer, Triad\u0027s president, sole shareholder, and licensed \"officer/broker,\" claiming that he was vicariously liable for the sales representative\u0027s unlawful actions. The District Court dismissed the claims, stating that the FHA did not impose personal vicarious liability upon a corporate officer or a \"designated officer/broker.\" In reversing, the Court of Appeals ruled that the FHA imposes strict liability principles beyond those traditionally associated with agent/principal or employee/employer relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fair Housing Act impose personal liability without fault upon an officer or owner of a residential real estate corporation for the unlawful activity of the corporation\u0027s employee or agent?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that the FHA  imposes liability without fault upon the employer in accordance with traditional agency principles. In other words, the FHA normally imposes vicarious liability upon the corporation, but not upon its officers or owners. In the absence of a clear indication of congressional intent to abrogate the common law principles of vicarious liability, the Court reasoned that neither the right of the officer to control the salesperson nor the overriding societal priority of the FHA\u0027s objectives warranted extending tort-related vicarious liability rules to include the officer. The Court also reasoned that nothing in the FHA supported imposing a non-delegable duty upon the officer to ensure that its salesperson did not discriminate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20634,"name":"Douglas G.

Wells filed suit, alleging that Clackamas Gastroenterology violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) when it terminated her employment. Clackamas moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was not covered by the Act because it did not have 15 or more employees for the 20 weeks required by the ADA. This argument depended on the four physician-shareholders, who own the professional corporation and constitute its board of directors, not being counted as employees. In granting the motion, the District Court concluded that the physicians were more analogous to partners in a partnership than to shareholders in a corporation and therefore were not employees under the ADA. In reversing, the Court of Appeals found no reasoned to permit the professional corporation to argue it was a partnership so as to avoid employment discrimination liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould four physicians actively engaged in medical practice as shareholders and directors of a professional corporation be counted as employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that the common-law element of control is the principal guidepost to be followed in deciding whether the four director-shareholder physicians in this case should be counted as employees and listed six factors that are relevant to such a decision. \"Because the District Court\u0027s findings appear to weigh in favor of concluding that the four physicians are not clinic employees, but evidence in the record may contradict those findings or support a contrary conclusion,\" the Court remanded the case for a determination under the new standard. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, dissented, arguing that the physician-shareholders function in several respects as common-law employees in their capacity as doctors performing everyday functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18566,"name":"Craig A.

The Court reasoned that the statutes were specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance, regardless of the fact that the statutes also had the effect of prohibiting providers from entering into limited network contracts with the HMOs. Moreover, the Court concluded that, by expanding the number of providers from whom an insured may receive health services, AWP laws alter the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds thus affecting the type of risk pooling arrangements that the HMOs could offer, thereby constituting regulation of the business of insurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39156,"name":"Robert N.

When police attempted to handcuff him, a struggle ensued, but it is unclear who started it. During the struggle, Martinez was shot, resulting in permanent paralysis and loss of vision. A year later he sued the officers, saying the search and use of deadly force were unconstitutional. The officers introduced as evidence in their defense a taped confession obtained while Martinez was receiving medical treatment in the hospital, in which he admitted to grabbing the gun of one of the officers during the struggle. Martinez claimed that the tape could not be used as evidence because he had not been read his Miranda rights. The district court ruled with Martinez that the tape was inadmissible. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre a suspect\u0027s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and his Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to be free from coercive questioning violated when he was subjected to coercive questioning while in police custody, even if his coerced statements were never used against him in a criminal case?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo; the Court remanded the substantive due process portion of the question. In a 6-3 judgment delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that Chavez did not deprive Martinez of his Fifth Amendment rights. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O\u0027Connor and Antonin Scalia, joined Justice Thomas. Justice David H. Souter, joined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, reasoned that Martinez\u0027s claim that his questioning alone was a violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments could be recognized if a \"core guarantee\" would be placed at risk; however, Martinez could not make the showing necessary to expand protection of the privilege against self-incrimination. Regarding substantive due process, Justice Souter delivered a 5-4 holding concluding that the issue whether Martinez may pursue a claim of liability for a substantive due process violation should be addressed on remand.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

During jury deliberations, a juror requested dismissal on two separate occasions. In order to avoid having to restart deliberations with a replacement juror, the judge asked the juror to continue. After further conversations between the judge and the juror in question as well as the foreperson of the jury, the jury returned a guilty verdict. On appeal to the Court of Appeals of California, Packer argued that the state trial judge had coerced the jury’s verdict in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. The appellate court affirmed his conviction and held that, as long as the judge only encouraged further deliberations and did not coerce a certain verdict, there was no violation of due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePacker petitioned for habeas relief from the federal district court, which denied his petition. The US.

After Congress enacted the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, which established a comprehensive concession management program for national parks, the National Park Service (NPS) issued 36 CFR section 51.3, which purported to render the CDA inapplicable to concession contracts. The National Park Hospitality Association challenged 51.3\u0027s validity. Upholding the regulation, the District Court concluded that the CDA is ambiguous as to whether it applies to concession contracts and found the NPS\u0027s interpretation reasonable. In affirming, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the NPS\u0027s reading of the CDA consistent with both the CDA and the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 apply to contracts between the National Park Service and concessioners in the national parks?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court did not answer the question. In a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that the controversy was not yet ripe for judicial resolution. The Court reasoned that, because the NPS has no delegated rulemaking authority under the CDA, 51.3 is nothing more than a general policy statement designed to inform the public of NPS\u0027s views on the CDA\u0027s proper application and thus the National Park Hospitality Association\u0027s challenge was a facial one. Given the absence of a concrete dispute, the Court asked the parties provide supplemental briefing on whether the case was ripe for judicial action.

The trial judge denied relief, finding no evidence indicating a systematic exclusion of African-Americans. Subsequently, the jury found Miller-El guilty, and he was sentenced to death. After Miller-El\u0027s direct appeal and state habeas corpus petitions were denied, he filed a federal habeas corpus petition. The Federal District Court denied Miller-El\u0027s application for a certificate of appealability (COA) in deference to the state courts\u0027 acceptance of the prosecutors\u0027 race-neutral justifications for striking the potential jurors. The Court of Appeals also denied the COA, finding that Miller-El failed to present clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust an inmate demonstrate that a state court\u0027s finding of the absence of purposeful discrimination was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence in order for a court of appeals to issue a certificate of appealability?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-1 opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that the Court of Appeals should have issued a COA to review the District Court\u0027s denial of habeas corpus relief. The Court reasoned, \"when a habeas applicant seeks permission to initiate appellate review of the dismissal of his petition, the court of appeals should limit its examination to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of his claims.\" Thus, a prisoner seeking a COA need only demonstrate \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\" and satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u0027s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to proceed further.

Grutter applied with a 3.8 undergraduate GPA and an LSAT score of 161. She was denied admission. The Law School admits that it uses race as a factor in making admissions decisions because it serves a \"compelling interest in achieving diversity among its student body.\" The District Court concluded that the Law School\u0027s stated interest in achieving diversity in the student body was not a compelling one and enjoined its use of race in the admissions process. In reversing, the Court of Appeals held that Justice Powell\u0027s opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), constituted a binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling governmental interest sufficient under strict scrutiny review to justify the use of racial preferences in admissions. The appellate court also rejected the district court\u0027s finding that the Law School\u0027s \"critical mass\" was the functional equivalent of a quota.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the University of Michigan Law School\u0027s use of racial preferences in student admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the Law School\u0027s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body. The Court reasoned that, because the Law School conducts highly individualized review of each applicant, no acceptance or rejection is based automatically on a variable such as race and that this process ensures that all factors that may contribute to diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race. Justice O\u0027Connor wrote, \"in the context of its individualized inquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law School\u0027s race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33878,"name":"Kirk O.

In state post-conviction proceedings, Abdur\u0027Rahman presented claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. Presenting all of his claims to the Tennessee Supreme Court, Abdur\u0027Rahman was denied leave to appeal, and then he only presented some of his claims, on which he ultimately lost, to the federal District Court. While Abdur\u0027Rahman\u0027s certiorari petition was pending, the Tennessee Supreme Court adopted Rule 39, which expressly states that Tennessee litigants do not need to seek discretionary review from the court in order to exhaust their claims. Abdur\u0027Rahman then filed a federal motion for relief of judgment, pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, re-presenting claims that the district court had previously determined to be unexhausted and procedurally barred. The District Court construed the Rule 60(b) motion as a second, or successive, habeas corpus petition and denied relief. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals denied all of Abdur\u0027Rahman\u0027s motions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion, filed in a habeas corpus proceeding to inform the federal courts of a state court\u0027s interpretation of state procedural laws, constitute a \"successive\" habeas corpus petition?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the writ of certiorari was dismissed as improvidently granted. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented.

The American Library Association and others challenged the law, claiming that it improperly required them to restrict the First Amendment rights of their patrons. As stipulated by the law, a three judge panel heard the case, and ruled unanimously that the CIPA violated the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Congress have the authority to require libraries to censor internet content in order to receive federal funding?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 judgment delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that, because public libraries\u0027 use of Internet filtering software does not violate their patrons\u0027 First Amendment rights, CIPA does not induce libraries to violate the Constitution and is a valid exercise of Congress\u0027s spending power. Justices Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas joined the Chief Justice\u0027s opinion. Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer filed opinions concurring in the judgment. Both noted that CIPA imposed a comparatively small burden on library Internet users that was not disproportionate to any potential speech-related harm, especially in light of the libraries\u0027 ability to unblock sites. Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter dissented. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Souter\u0027s dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38319,"name":"Paul M.

The settlement created a fund that would pay those who developed illnesses up until 1994. Daniel Stephenson, a Vietnam veteran, developed cancer in 1998 and could therefore not collect money from the fund. He sued, saying that he was not adequately represented in the original settlement, which made no provision for injuries that developed after 1994. Therefore, he claimed, he had the right to file a suit of his own. The district court ruled for Dow Chemical; the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously reversed, ruling for Stephenson.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the 1984 Agent Orange settlement preclude plaintiffs, who allege that they were inadequately represented in the prior litigation, from asserting claims?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eAn equally divided Court affirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit panel that convened to hear their appeals included two judges from that court, both of whom are life-tenured Article III judges, and the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, an Article IV territorial-court judge appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a 10-year term. Neither Nguyen nor Phan objected to the panel\u0027s composition before the cases were submitted for decision and neither sought rehearing to challenge the panel\u0027s authority to decide their appeals immediately after it affirmed their convictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid a panel of the Court of Appeals consisting of two Article III judges and one Article IV judge have the authority to decide the appeals of two defendants convicted on federal narcotics charges in the District Court of Guam?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that the Court of Appeals panel did not have the authority to decide Nguyen and Phan\u0027s appeals. The Court reasoned that the territorial judge was precluded from designation to the panel and thus the defendants\u0027 appeals required reconsideration by a properly constituted panel. The Court found that the statutory and constitutional provisions governing the creation and tenure of territorial judges were distinct from those for district court judges and that the territorial district court was not constituted pursuant to the chapter required to meet the definition of a district court. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, dissented, arguing that neither Nguyen nor Phan showed that the error seriously affected the judicial proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30625,"name":"Jeffrey T.

Tsakopoulos planned to subdivide the land into parcels for cultivation as vineyards and orchards. Because a dense layer of material prevented water from reaching the depths necessary to cultivate vineyards or orchards, Tsakopoulos intended to \"deep rip\" the soil. Deep ripping has a dramatic effect on the character of a wetland area. The Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency informed Tsakopoulos that he was not to deep rip protected waters without a permit. Ultimately, the District Court found that Tsakopoulos had violated the Clean Water Act multiple times and imposed a substantial fine. The Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes deep plowing ranchland to plant deep-rooted crops constitute the \"addition\" of a \"pollutant\" from a \"point source\" so as to fall within the regulation of the Clean Water Act? Is deep plowing ranchland which is farmable in its natural state to plant deep-rooted crops statutorily exempt from regulation under the Act\u0027s exemption for any discharge from \"normal farming...activities such as plowing?\" Does the Act\u0027s civil penalty section authorize assessing the maximum daily penalty for each time a plow crosses a seasonal drainage feature, without regard to the number of days when such activity occurred?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the Court affirmed the judgment of the appeals court by an equally divided vote.

Among it rules, Washington\u0027s program requires that funds that cannot earn net interest for the client be deposited in an IOLTA account. The Supreme Court of Washington extended its IOLTA rules to cover Limited Practice Officers (LPOs), nonlawyers who are licensed to act as escrowees in real estate closings. Allen Brown and Greg Hayes alleged that they regularly purchase and sell real estate, in the course of such transactions they deliver funds to LPOs who are required to deposit them in IOLTA accounts, and the taking of the interest earned on their funds in IOLTA accounts violates the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court found, among other things, that Brown and Hayes had lost nothing. Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reasoned that there was no taking because Brown and Hayes had suffered neither an actual loss nor an interference with any investment-backed expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the use of interest on lawyers\u0027 trust accounts to pay for legal services provided to the needy constitute a state taking in violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that state law that requires client funds that could not otherwise generate net earnings for the client to be deposited in an IOLTA account is not a regulatory taking. Moreover, the Court reasoned that, because compensation is measured by the owner\u0027s pecuniary loss, which is zero whenever the Washington law is obeyed, there is no violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, dissented, arguing that the Court\u0027s decision created an exception to its general rule that the just compensation owed to former owners of confiscated property is the fair market value of the property taken. Justice Kennedy also filed a separate dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20555,"name":"David J.

The law defines \"dilution\" as \"the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services.\" The District Court granted V Secret summary judgment on the FTDA claim. The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that V Secret\u0027s mark was distinctive and that the evidence established dilution even though no actual harm had been proved.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Federal Trademark Dilution Act require objective proof of actual injury to the economic value of a famous mark for relief?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to parts I, II, and IV of the opinion, which held that the FTDA requires proof of actual dilution. The Court reasoned this standard, as opposed to a presumption of harm arising from a subjective \"likelihood of dilution\" standard, controlled. \"There is a complete absence of evidence of any lessening of the capacity of the Victoria\u0027s Secret mark to identify and distinguish goods or services sold in Victoria\u0027s Secret stores or advertised in its catalogs,\" wrote Justice Stevens.

In 1975, Doubleday renewed the book\u0027s copyright, but Fox never renewed the copyright on the television series, leaving the series in the public domain. In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights. In 1995, Dastar Corporation released a video set, World War II Campaigns in Europe, which it made from tapes of the original version of the Crusade television series. Fox filed suit, alleged that Dastar\u0027s sale of Campaigns without proper credit to the Crusade television series constituted \"reverse passing off\" in violation of the Lanham Act. The District Court granted Fox summary judgment. In affirming, the Court of Appeals held that, because Dastar copied substantially the Crusade series, labeled it with a different name, and marketed it without attribution to Fox, Dastar had committed a \"bodily appropriation\" of Fox\u0027s series, which was sufficient to establish reverse passing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Lanham Act prevent the unaccredited copying of a work? If so, may a court double a profit award under the Act in order to deter future infringing conduct?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo; the Court did not answer the question. In an 8-0 opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not prevent the unaccredited copying of an uncopyrighted work. Under the Lanham Act, the Court reasoned that no false designation of origin was shown since the phrase \"origin of goods,\" as used in the Act, did not connote the person or entity that originated the ideas contained in the video, but instead referred only to the producer\u0027s tangible video product. Thus, Dastar was the \"origin\" of the products it sold as its own, without acknowledging the series, because it marketed a video that copied a public domain television series. Justice Stephen G. Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20721,"name":"Dale M.

After it became profitable for some California processors to buy raw milk from out-of-state producers, the California Department of Food and Agriculture amended its regulations to require contributions to the price equalization pool on some out-of-state purchases. Four dairy farms in Nevada filed suit, alleging that the amendment unconstitutionally discriminated against them. Without reaching the merits, the District Court dismissed both cases. In affirming, the Court of Appeals held that the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 immunized California\u0027s milk pricing and pooling laws from Commerce Clause challenge. The appellate court also held that the individual petitioners\u0027 Privileges and Immunities Clause claims failed because the amendment did not create classifications based on any individual\u0027s residency or citizenship.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 exempt California\u0027s milk pricing and pooling regulations from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause? Are individual claims under the Privileges and Immunities Clause against California\u0027s required contributions to the price equalization pool on some out-of-state purchases foreclosed because those regulations do not discriminate on their face on the basis of state citizenship or state residence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In an opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held, 8-1, that, because the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 did not clearly express an intent to insulate California\u0027s pricing and pooling laws from a Commerce Clause challenge, the Court of Appeals erred in relying on it to dismiss the case. The Court also held, 9-0, that the appellate court erred in rejecting the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim on the ground that the California laws did not, on their face, create classifications based on any individual\u0027s residency or citizenship. The Court reasoned that the absence of an express statement identifying out-of-state citizenship as a basis for disparate treatment was not a sufficient basis for rejecting the claim. Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in part and dissented in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39134,"name":"Roy T.

A private person may bring a qui tam action \"in the name of the Government\" under the FCA. After the National Institute of Drug Abuse gave Cook County Hospital a $5 million research grant, Janet Chandler, who ran the study for a nonprofit research institute affiliated with the hospital, filed a qui tam action, claiming that Cook County and the institute had submitted false statements to obtain grant funds. Based on precedent, which held that States are not \"persons\" subject to FCA qui tam actions, the District Court granted the County\u0027s motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre local governments \"persons\" subject to qui tam actions under the False Claims Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that the term \"person\" includes local governments. The Court noted that the County, as a recipient of federal funding, was clearly able to abuse federal spending and was thus subject to the FCA remedy that applied to prevent such abuse. Rejecting the Country\u0027s argument that is was not subject to punitive damages, the Court responded that the federal government amended the FCA to make it a more effective tool against fraud. \"It is simply not plausible that Congress intended to repeal municipal liability sub silentio by the very Act it passed to strengthen the Government\u0027s hand in fighting false claims,\" wrote Justice Souter.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32041,"name":"Judson H.

Only one of the three staff members gave written consent. The other two members voluntarily participated. When the medical staff won, Withrow appealed and the Court of Appeals sua sponte remanded the case to determine whether the parties had consented to proceed before the magistrate judge. Ultimately, the magistrate judge reported that she had lacked jurisdiction because such consent had to be expressly given. The District Court adopted the report and recommendation. In affirming, the Court of Appeals found that consent must be express and that the staffs\u0027 postjudgment consent was inadequate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan consent, under the Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, be inferred from a party\u0027s conduct during litigation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that consent to a magistrate judge\u0027s designation can be inferred from a party\u0027s conduct during litigation. Distinguishing between full and part-time magistrate judges, the Court reasoned that the \"unadorned references\" regarding the consent of the parties and full-time magistrate judges provided for jurisdiction as long as the parties voluntarily consented. \"[The two staff members\u0027] general appearances before the Magistrate Judge, after they had been told of their right to be tried by a district judge, supply the consent necessary for the Magistrate Judge\u0027s \u0027civil jurisdiction,\u0027\" wrote Justice Souter.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34381,"name":"Lisa R.

After October 1, 1993, the Commissioner assigned 600 hundred beneficiaries to various coal companies. The companies challenged the assignments, claiming that the statutory date sets a time limit on the Commissioner\u0027s power to assign such that a beneficiary not assigned on October 1, 1993 must be left unassigned for life. Under the companies\u0027 argument, the challenged assignments are void and the corresponding benefits must be financed by other pension plans and funds. The companies obtained summary judgments, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the assignment of beneficiaries, under Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, valid if the assignment was made after the Act\u0027s October 1, 1993 deadline?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that the Commissioner\u0027s initial assignments made after October 1, 1993, are valid despite their untimeliness. The Court reasoned that a statute directing official action needed more than a mandatory \"shall\" before the grant of power would be read to expire when the job was supposed to be completed. Moreover, Justice Souter noted that the Act was designed to assign the greatest number of beneficiaries and read the statutory date as a spur to prompt action. Justice Antonin Scalia dissented, in which Justices Sandra Day O\u0027Connor and Clarence Thomas joined. Justice Thomas also filed a separate dissenting opinion. Both read the Act has establishing a clear deadline for the expiration of the Commissioner\u0027s authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37735,"name":"Peter Buscemi","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/peter_buscemi","view_count":0,"last_name":"Buscemi","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"peter_buscemi"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioners Holland, et al","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18308"},{"advocate":{"ID":17846,"name":"Barbara B.

Regarding research and development (R\u0026amp;D) expenses, Treasury Regulation 26 CFR section 1.861-8(e)(3) provides what must be treated as a cost when calculating combined taxable income (CTI), and how those costs should be allocated among different products and apportioned between the DISC and its parent. Under this regulation, the Internal Revenue Service reallocated Boeing\u0027s company sponsored R\u0026amp;D costs for 1979 to 1987, thereby decreasing the untaxed profits of its export subsidiaries and increasing its taxable profits on export sales. Subsequently, Boeing filed suit, arguing that it had an unqualified right to allocate its company sponsored R\u0026amp;D expenses to specific products and to exclude any allocated R\u0026amp;D from being treated as a cost of another product. In granting Boeing summary judgment, the District Court found section 1.861-8(e)(3) invalid due to a specific DISC regulation giving the taxpayer the right to group and allocate income and costs by product or product line. The Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Boeing Co. required to take into account expenses incurred for R\u0026amp;D in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations in calculating its \"combined taxable income\" for purposes of determining taxation with respect to its domestic international sales corporation and foreign sales corporation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that section 1.861-8(e)(3) is a proper exercise of the Secretary of the Treasury\u0027s rulemaking authority. The Court reasoned that the general regulation classifying all R\u0026amp;D as an indirect cost attributable to all export sales was not arbitrary as it provided consistent treatment for costs items used in computing domestic taxable income and combined taxable income. Justice Stevens wrote that the rule\u0027s \"allocation of R\u0026amp;D expenditures to all products in a category even when specifically intended to improve only one or a few of those products is no more tenuous than the allocation of a chief executive officer\u0027s salary to every product that a company sells even when he devotes virtually all of his time to the development of an Edsel.\" Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Antonin Scalia joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33864,"name":"Kent L.

The “dangerous weapon” was a pocketknife with a 2.5-3 inch blade. In 1997, the state court interpreted the “common pocketknife” exception to the definition of “weapon” as a blade of 3.75 inches or shorter. Bunkley filed a motion for state post-conviction relief based on the state court’s 1997 decision and argued that his pocketknife could not have been considered a “weapon.” The trial court rejected the defendant’s motion for relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Florida Supreme Court also affirmed and found the “common pocketknife” exception did not apply retroactively because the 1997 decision was merely an “evolutionary refinement,” not a “major constitutional change,” and therefore did not apply retroactively.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the first-degree burglary conviction be remanded to the state court to consider whether the inmate’s pocketknife fit within the “common pocketknife” exception at the time his conviction became final?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the majority held that the Florida Supreme Court failed to decide whether the pocketknife fit within the “common pocketknife” exception at the time the conviction became final. Although the state court called the interpretation an “evolutionary refinement,” it did not decide whether the weapon statute had “evolved” by 1989 to fit the inmate’s pocketknife within the exception. Therefore, the Court held the first-degree burglary conviction should be remanded to the state court to consider whether the inmate’s pocketknife fit within the “common pocketknife” exception at the time his conviction became final.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented and argued that the Supreme Court should not have granted certiorari in this case. He argued that the Florida Supreme Court has already concluded that the change in the law in question should not apply retroactively. Therefore, the majority’s decision incorrectly revisited and overrode the Florida Supreme Court. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Justice Clarence Thomas joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"538","page":"835","year":"2003","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/18999"},"decisions":[{"description":"The state court must consider whether the inmate’s pocketknife fit within the “common pocketknife” exception at the time his conviction became final.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15141,"name":"William H.

In 1998, an immigration judge heard Orlando Ventura’s request for asylum in the United States; he claimed that his political views made him a target for guerilla armies in Guatemala. The judge denied Orlando Ventura’s request, despite recognizing that Orlando Ventura’s fears of prosecution may be legitimate, because the political climate in Guatemala had drastically changed since Orlando Ventura had arrived in the United States and therefore he was no longer in danger. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the judgment of the immigration judge, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was “compelled” by Orlando Ventura’s testimony to reverse the lower court’s decision and subsequently denied remand to the BIA.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould an appellate court remand a case to an agency when additional investigation within the agency’s area of expertise may be required?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eGenerally, an appellate court should remand a case for further agency review when the matter to be reconsidered is one over which the agency has statutory authority and expertise.

In 2000, Christine Beaumont and the North Carolina Right to Life (NCRL), an anti-abortion advocacy group, challenged the act, saying it violated their right to free speech. The group is an incorporated non-profit that lobbies and backs political candidates friendly to its cause, but under the act it cannot make political donations. The district court ruled in favor of NCRL. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Federal Election Campaign Act\u0027s ban on corporate political donations violate the freedom of speech for incorporated, non-profit advocacy groups?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that applying the direct contribution prohibition to nonprofit advocacy corporations is consistent with the First Amendment. The Court reasoned that it could not hold for NCRL \"without recasting our understanding of the risks of harm posed by corporate political contributions, of the expressive significance of contributions, and of the consequent deference owed to legislative judgments on what to do about them.\" Justice Anthony M. Kennedy filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, dissented, arguing that section 441b should have been subject to strict scrutiny and, under this standard, it could not stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

In 1998, Marion Stogner was indicted for sex-related child abuse committed between 1955 and 1973. Without the new statute allowing revival of the State\u0027s cause of action, California could not have prosecuted Stogner. Stogner moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids revival of a previously time-barred prosecution. The trial court agreed, but the California Court of Appeal reversed. The trial court denied Stogner\u0027s subsequent dismissal motion, in which he argued that his prosecution violated the Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses. The Court of Appeal affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Ex Post Facto Clause bar the application of California\u0027s retroactive extension of the statutes of limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that a law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution. The Court reasoned that the features of the law produce the kind of retroactivity that the Constitution forbids by inflicting punishment where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment. \"After...the original statute of limitations had expired,...Stogner was not \u0027liable to any punishment,\u0027\" wrote Justice Breyer. \"California\u0027s new statute therefore \u0027aggravated\u0027 Stogner\u0027s alleged crime, or made it \u0027greater than it was, when committed,\u0027 in the sense that...it \u0027inflicted punishment\u0027 for past criminal conduct that...did not trigger any such liability.\" In his dissent, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy argued, \"A law which does not alter the definition of the crime but only revives prosecution does not make the crime \u0027greater than it was, when committed.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40085,"name":"Roberto Najera","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/roberto_najera","view_count":0,"last_name":"Najera","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"roberto_najera"},"advocate_description":"Martinez, California, argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18317"},{"advocate":{"ID":28554,"name":"Irving L.

The group asserted that gambling at racetracks and riverboat casinos is is not substantially different, and that the state should therefore charge the same tax rate for both activities. A state district court sided with the state, ruling that important differences did exist between riverboat and racetrack gambling; the Iowa Supreme Court reversed in a 4-3 decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo different tax rates levied against racetrack and casino gambling violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that Iowa\u0027s differential tax rate, which distinguishes between adjusted revenues from slot machines at racetracks and revenues from riverboat slot machines, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Court found that the facts did not preclude an inference that the reason for the different tax rates was to help the riverboat industry or the river communities. Thus, the Court reasoned there was a rational basis for the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43004,"name":"Thomas J.

Subsequently, when the prosecution made a statement on first-degree murder, defense counsel objected, arguing that the court had granted its directed verdict motion and that further prosecution on first-degree murder would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The judge responded that he had granted the motion but had not directed a verdict. The judge then submitted the first-degree murder charge to the jury, which convicted Vincent on that charge. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction based on the Double Jeopardy Clause. In reversing, the State Supreme Court determined that the trial judge\u0027s comments were not sufficiently final to terminate jeopardy. Subsequently, the Federal District Court granted Vincent\u0027s federal habeas corpus petition after concluding that continued prosecution for first-degree murder had violated the Double Jeopardy Clause and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a defendant\u0027s right against double jeopardy violated when a trial judge grants a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal as to first-degree murder, but does not direct such a verdict to the jury that subsequently convicts the defendant of first-degree murder?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that the defendant did not meet the requirements for habeas relief. The Court stated that Vincent was entitled to relief only if he can demonstrate that the state court\u0027s adjudication of his claim was \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application of\" the Court\u0027s clearly established precedents. Finding that the state court\u0027s adjudication of his claim was not, the Court reversed the Court of Appeals because \"Even if we agreed with the Court of Appeals that the Double Jeopardy Clause should be read to prevent continued prosecution of a defendant under these circumstances, it was at least reasonable for the state court to conclude otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15607,"name":"Arthur A.

(NOW) filed a class action alleging that certain individuals and organizations that oppose legal abortion violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by engaging in a nationwide conspiracy to shut down abortion clinics through \"a pattern of racketeering activity\" that included acts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act. Ultimately, the District Court entered a permanent nationwide injunction against the abortion opponents. Upholding the injunction, the Court of Appeals held, in part, that the things abortion supporters claimed were extorted from them, such as women\u0027s right to seek medical services from the clinics and the clinic doctors\u0027 rights to perform their jobs, constituted \"property\" that was \"obtained\" for purposes of the Hobbs Act. (Together with No. 01-1119, Operation Rescue v. National Organization for Women.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo abortion opponents, who protest at abortion clinics, commit extortion within the meaning of the Hobbs Act? May abortion supporters obtain injunctive relief in a civil action pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an 8-1 opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that abortion opponents did not commit extortion because they did not \"obtain\" property from the abortion supporters as required by the Hobbs Act. The Court further held that is first holding renders insufficient the other bases or predicate acts of racketeering supporting the jury\u0027s conclusion that the abortion opponents violated RICO. While the opponents\u0027 conduct constituted the separate offense of coercion, reasoned Chief Justice Rehnquist, the opponents neither pursued nor received something of value from the supporters that the opponents could exercise, transfer, or sell, and thus did not commit extortion. Without an underlying RICO violation, the Court vacated the District Court\u0027s injunction and did not reach the second question. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39134,"name":"Roy T.

The Tribe sued the federal government to rehabilitate the property, alleging that the United States had breached a fiduciary duty to maintain, protect, repair, and preserve it. In its motion to dismiss, the federal government argued that jurisdiction was lacking here because no statute or regulation could be read to impose a legal obligation on it to maintain or restore the trust property, let alone authorize compensation for breach. The Court of Federal Claims agreed and dismissed the complaint. In reversing, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluded that the federal government\u0027s property use triggered a common-law trustee\u0027s duty to act reasonably to preserve any property the Secretary of the Interior chose to utilize, which also supported a money damages claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Court of Federal Claims, under the Indian Tucker Act, have jurisdiction over the White Mountain Apache Tribe\u0027s suit against the United States for breach of fiduciary duty to manage land and improvements held in trust for the Tribe but occupied by the federal government?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that Public Law 86-392 gives rise to Indian Tucker Act jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over the Tribe\u0027s suit. The Court reasoned that, although the statute providing for the land to be held in trust imposed no duties on the United States to maintain the land, the occupation of such land by the United States raised a duty to preserve trust assets and that it naturally followed that the United States was liable in damages for the breach of such duties. Justice Clarence Thomas, with whom Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy joined, dissented. Justice Thomas argued that the majority\u0027s opinion \"radically alters the relevant inquiry from one focused on the actual fiduciary duties created by statute or regulation to one divining fiduciary duties out of the use of the word \u0027trust\u0027 and notions of factual control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38686,"name":"Robert C.

To prevent the limitations period on those claims from expiring, 28 USC section 1367(d) requires state courts to toll the period while a supplemental claim is pending in federal court. In 1994, Susan Jinks filed a federal-court action against Richland County, South Carolina. The District Court granted the county summary judgment and declined to exercise jurisdiction over Jinks\u0027s state-law claims. Jinks then filed the supplemental claims in state court and won. In reversing, the Supreme Court of South Carolina found the state-law claims time-barred. Although they would not have been barred under section 1367(d)\u0027s tolling rule, the court held section 1367(d) unconstitutional as applied to claims brought in state court against a State\u0027s political subdivisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs 28 USC section 1367(d), which requires state statute of limitations to be tolled for the period during which a plaintiff\u0027s cause of action had previously been pending in federal court, constitutional as applied to lawsuits brought against a State\u0027s political subdivisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that section 1367(d)\u0027s application to claims brought against a State\u0027s political subdivisions is constitutional. The Court reasoned that section 1367(d) is necessary and proper for carrying into execution Congress\u0027s power \"to constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court\" under Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, as it provides a straightforward tolling rule, which promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts and is therefore conducive to the administration of justice. The Court also reiterated that, while Congress lacks Article I authority to override a State\u0027s immunity from suit in its own courts, it may subject a municipality to suit in state court if that is done pursuant to a valid exercise of its enumerated powers. Justice David H. Souter filed a concurring opinion, noting that he did not shift from his dissent in Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40209,"name":"Robert S.

He claimed he could not see the “no parking” sign because there were trees blocking it from view. David paid the fees to recover his car, but he also submitted a request for a hearing to challenge the ticket and recover his money. The hearing was held 27 days after the car was towed, and David’s claim was dismissed. David then sued the City of Los Angeles under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and claimed that the 27-day wait for the hearing denied him due process under the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment for the City, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the Due Process Clause required that the city hold a hearing at least within five days.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a 27-day delay before a hearing violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying an individual the opportunity to be heard “at a meaningful time and in an meaningful manner”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA 27-day delay before a hearing does not violate the Due Process Clause.

Petitioners, whose products or services build on copyrighted works that have entered the public domain, argued that the CTEA violates both the Copyright Clause\u0027s \"limited Times\" prescription and the First Amendment\u0027s free speech guarantee.

A California jury found that the rollover was caused by a dangerous flaw in the design of the Bronco, which Ford had willfully ignored. The jury awarded Romo $5 million in compensatory damages (which are intended to compensate the plaintiff for a loss) and $290 million in punitive damages (which are intended to punish the defendant for wrongdoing.) Ford argued that the very large award of punitive damages was excessive. Nevertheless, the California Fifth Appellate District Court of Appeal upheld the verdict, comparing the level of Ford\u0027s negligence to involuntary manslaughter. After the California Supreme Court declined to hear the case, Ford appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the punitive damages awarded by the jury were so excessive as to be prohibited by the Constitution\u0027s Due Process Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs an award of $290 million in punitive damages, when full compensatory damages are $5 million, excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a short, anonymous order, the Court voided the California Appellate Court\u0027s decision and sent the case back for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court\u0027s 2003 decision in \u003cem\u003eState Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v.

The Act required all insurance companies doing business in California that sold policies to people in Europe between 1920 and 1945 to make public all of those policies, including the names of policy owners and the status of the policies. A group of insurance companies and a trade organization sued, saying that only the federal government, with its jurisdiction over commerce and foreign affairs, had the right to enact such legislation. They also said the law violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution because the companies, if they failed to comply, could lose their insurance licenses. The District Court ruled for the insurance companies; the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid California\u0027s passage of the HVIRA interfere with the federal government\u0027s sovereignty over foreign affairs established by Article I of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that California\u0027s HVIRA interferes with the president\u0027s ability to conduct the nation\u0027s foreign policy and is therefore preempted. The Court reasoned that an exercise of state power that concerns foreign relations must yield to the Federal Government\u0027s policy or that generally there is executive authority to decide what policy should be implemented. Based on an account of related international negotiations, the Court found sufficiently clear conflict between HVIRA and the President\u0027s foreign policy. \"The basic fact is that California seeks to use an iron fist where the President has consistently chosen kid gloves,\" wrote Justice Souter. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, dissented, arguing that no executive agreement or other formal expression of foreign policy expressly disapproved of state disclosure laws like California\u0027s HVIRA.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

Visciotti asked the driver to stop the car in a remote area, pulled out a gun, and demanded the victims’ wallets. Because the victims had little money in their wallets, Visciotti located the money in the car and then shot the victims. Visciotti was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and robbery. The jury recommended the death penalty since the homicide took place during a robbery with a deadly weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisciotti petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus from the California Supreme Court and claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The California Supreme Court denied the petition and held that, although Visciotti received ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of his trial, the jury was not prejudiced. The state court interpreted the Supreme Court’s ineffective assistance of counsel precedent as requiring the defendant to show that, more likely than not, the outcome of the trial would have been different had it not been for the ineffective assistance of counsel. Visciotti then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus from the federal district court, which granted the petition and determined that Visciotti had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas a state court’s application of the Supreme Court’s ineffective assistance of counsel precedent as requiring the defendant to show prejudice by a preponderance of the evidence objectively unreasonable?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that, unless the state court applied established U.S. Supreme Court precedent in a manner that was objectively unreasonable, a federal court cannot overrule a state court’s decision on habeas review.

Under California\u0027s three strikes regime, a judge sentenced him to two consecutive terms of 25 years to life. In affirming, the California Court of Appeal rejected his claim that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment. After the Supreme Court of California denied discretionary review, Andrade filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court. The District Court denied his petition. In reversing, the Court of Appeals granted Andrade a certificate of appealability as to his claim that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Federal Court of Appeals err in holding that California Court of Appeal\u0027s affirmation of a sentence of two consecutive terms of 25 years to life in prison for a \"third strike\" conviction was \"grossly disproportionate\" to the crime and thus violated the Eighth Amendment\u0027s prohibition on \"cruel and unusual punishment\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the California Court of Appeal\u0027s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, the Court\u0027s clearly established law within the meaning of 28 USC section 2254(d)(1). The Court reasoned that, because the \"precise contours\" of the proportionality principle were unclear, it was not objectively unreasonable for the state appellate court to conclude that the \"contours\" permitted an affirmance of the sentence. The gross disproportionality principle reserves a constitutional violation for only the extraordinary case, wrote Justice O\u0027Connor. \"This is the rare sentence of demonstrable gross disproportionality,\" argued Justice David H. Souter in his dissent, in which Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G.

The District Court refused to compel arbitration of the RICO claims on the ground that the arbitration clauses in the parties\u0027 agreements prohibited awards of punitive damages. Subsequently, the court found the arbitration agreements unenforceable. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a group of physicians be compelled to arbitrate claims arising under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, even though the parties\u0027 arbitration agreements may be construed to limit the arbitrator\u0027s authority to award damages?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-0 opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that the proper course in this case was to compel arbitration. The Court reasoned that since it did not know how the arbitrator would construe the remedial limitations, given the Court\u0027s prior decisions, the questions whether they render the parties\u0027 agreement unenforceable was unusually abstract and thus it would be premature for the Court to address them.

The California Franchise Tax Board (CFTB) determined that Hyatt was a California resident until April 1992 and issued notices of proposed assessments and imposed substantial civil fraud penalties. Hyatt filed suit against CFTB in a Nevada state court, alleging that CFTB had committed negligence and intentional torts during the course of its audit. CFTB argued that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because full faith and credit required that the court apply California law immunizing CFTB from suit. Ultimately, the Nevada Supreme Court allowed the intentional tort claims to proceed to trial. The court held that affording CFTB statutory immunity with respect to intentional torts would contravene Nevada\u0027s interest in protecting its citizens from injurious intentional torts and bad faith acts committed by sister States\u0027 government employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Nevada Supreme Court\u0027s refusal to extend full faith and credit to California\u0027s statute immunizing its tax collection agency from suit violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the court held that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require Nevada to give full faith and credit to California\u0027s statutes providing its tax agency with immunity from suit. Noting that Nevada did not grant immunity to its agencies for intentional torts, the Court reasoned that Nevada\u0027s interest in redressing intentional tortious conduct was sufficient to decline to accord full faith and credit to California\u0027s immunity of its tax agency to bar intentional tort claims. Accordingly, the Court refused to adopt a new rule mandating that a state court extend full faith and credit to a sister State\u0027s statutorily recaptured sovereign immunity from suit when a refusal to do so would interfere with the State\u0027s capacity to fulfill its own sovereign responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24226,"name":"Felix Leatherwood","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/felix_leatherwood","view_count":0,"last_name":"Leatherwood","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"felix_leatherwood"},"advocate_description":"or the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18363"},{"advocate":{"ID":27019,"name":"H.

He appealed, claiming that his attorney\u0027s decision not to tell jurors about Wiggins\u0027 troubled childhood amounted to ineffective counsel because it resulted in a harsher sentence. Prosecutors countered that the attorney\u0027s decision had been carefully considered, and that a different decision would not necessarily have resulted in a different outcome. Therefore, they said, it was not ineffective counsel. A Maryland district court sided with Wiggins; the Maryland Supreme Court reversed, siding with the state. On appeal to federal court, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling for Maryland.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a criminal defendant\u0027s attorneys\u0027 failure to investigate his background and present mitigating evidence of his unfortunate life history at his capital sentencing proceedings constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court held that the performance of Wiggins\u0027s attorneys at sentencing violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The Court reasoned that Wiggins\u0027s counsel did not conduct a reasonable investigation because, among other things, standard practice in Maryland in 1989 included the preparation of a social history report, which his attorneys did not commission even though the necessary funds were available. The Court concluded that Wiggins\u0027s counsels\u0027 failures prejudiced his defense. \"Had the jury been able to place [Wiggins\u0027s] excruciating life history on the mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance,\" wrote Justice O\u0027Connor.

In 1964, Navajo Nation (tribe) entered into a lease with the predecessor of Peabody Coal Company, allowing Peabody to mine on the tribe\u0027s land in return for a royalty of 37.5 cents for every ton of coal mined. The agreement was subject to renegotiation after 20 years. By 1984, the tribe\u0027s royalty was only worth 2% of Peabody\u0027s gross proceeds. In 1977 Congress had required a minimum of 12.5%. The tribe requested that the Secretary set a new rate, and the Director of Bureau of Indian Affairs for the Navajo Area, as the Secretary\u0027s representative, made a preliminary decision to set the rate at 20%. Peabody\u0027s representatives urged the Secretary to reverse or delay the decision. The Secretary agreed, and urged the parties to resume negotiations. The tribe and Peabody agreed on a rate of 12.5%. In 1993, however, the tribe sued the government in the Court of Federal Claims, alleging a breach of trust and claiming $600 million in damages. The court ruled for the government, explaining that though the government may have betrayed the tribe\u0027s trust by acting in Peabody\u0027s interest rather than the tribe\u0027s, it had not violated any specific statutory or regulatory obligation. The tribe was therefore not entitled to monetary relief. On appeal, the tribe argued that the entirety of the IMLA imposes on the government a broad obligation to look after the wellbeing of the tribe. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit agreed and reversed the lower court, finding that \"the Secretary must act in the best interests of the Indian tribes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the U.S. be held liable for a breach of trust with an Indian Tribe in connection with the negotiation of a mining lease, even when the U.S. has violated no specific statutory or regulatory duty established in the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that an Indian Tribe must \"identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties.\" The opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that the IMLA could not be interpreted to require the Secretary to exercise broad authority to manage the tribe\u0027s resources for the tribe\u0027s benefit. Instead, the tribe itself controls negotiations and the Secretary has a more limited role in approving the agreements. The Court concluded that no provision of the IMLA entitled the tribe to monetary damages as a result of the government\u0027s role in the negotiations. Justice Souter, joined by justices Stevens and O\u0027Connor, wrote a dissent arguing that the Secretary\u0027s approval power must be exercised for the tribe\u0027s benefit, and monetary damages may be awarded if the power is misused.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

With the help of the truck drivers, the police set up a sting. Francisco Jimenez Recio and Adrian Lopez-Meza came for the truck and were subsequently arrested. A jury convicted Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza of conspiracy, but the trial judge ordered a new trial under Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals precedent that held a conspiracy terminates when \"\u0027there is affirmative evidence of...defeat of the object of the conspiracy.\u0027\" In other words, the federal government could not prosecute the drug conspiracy defendants unless they had joined the conspiracy before the government seized the drugs. The new jury convicted the two men once again. In reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence presented at the second trial was insufficient to show that Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza had joined the conspiracy before the drug seizure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Ninth Circuit rule -- that a conspiracy ends automatically when the object of the conspiracy becomes impossible to achieve -- valid?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 9-0 opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that a conspiracy does not automatically terminate simply because the federal government has defeated its object, such that Ninth Circuit\u0027s conspiracy-termination law is erroneous.

After the company denied his claim, Nord asked for a review of the denial. A doctor hired by the company determined that Nord could in fact perform the duties required by his job and was therefore ineligible for benefits, despite determinations to the contrary by Nord\u0027s physician, his orthopedic surgeon and a Black \u0026amp; Decker human resource representative. Nord sued to have the decision reversed, claiming that the company\u0027s preference of its doctor\u0027s opinion over the opinions of the other physicians violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The district court ruled in favor of Black \u0026amp; Decker Corp.

The Court reasoned that the Court of Appeals erroneously applied a \"treating physician rule\" because nothing in ERISA gave rise to such a rule. Justice Ginsburg wrote, \"courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant\u0027s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician\u0027s evaluation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34185,"name":"Lisa S.

Though prosecutors found a bullet before the trial began and did not inform the defense until the trial was underway, defense counsel declined more than once the trial court\u0027s offer of a continuance so the bullet could be examined. Subsequently, Massaro was convicted. On direct appeal, Massaro but did not raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Massaro later moved to vacate his conviction, under 28 USC section 2255, based on an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. The District Court found his claim procedurally defaulted because he could have raised it on direct appeal. In affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that, when the defendant is represented by new counsel on appeal and the ineffective-assistance claim is based solely on the trial record, the claim must be raised on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, whether or not there is new counsel on appeal and whether or not the basis for the claim is apparent from the trial record, be raised on direct appeal?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that failure to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal does not bar the claim from being brought in a collateral proceeding under section 2255, whether or not the petitioner could have raised the claim on direct appeal. The Court reasoned that requiring a criminal defendant to bring ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal would create a risk that defendants would feel compelled to raise the issue before there has been an opportunity fully to develop it. Moreover, the Court noted its new rule would provide for ineffective-assistance claims to be litigated in the District Court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42056,"name":"Sri Srinivasan","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sri_srinivasan","view_count":0,"last_name":"Srinivasan","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"sri_srinivasan"},"advocate_description":"Department of Justice, argued the cause for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18391"},{"advocate":{"ID":26978,"name":"Herald Price Fahringer","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/herald_p_fahringer","view_count":0,"last_name":"Fahringer","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"herald_p_fahringer"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18392"},{"advocate":{"ID":21148,"name":"David A.

The contracts provided that the telemarketers would retain 85 percent of the gross receipts from Illinois donors. The Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint in state court, alleging that the telemarketers represented to donors that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow for charitable endeavors and that such representations were knowingly deceptive and materially false and constituted a fraud. The trial court granted the telemarketers\u0027 motion to dismiss on First Amendment grounds. In affirming, the Illinois Supreme Courts relied on U.S. Supreme Court precedent that held that certain regulations of charitable solicitation barring fees in excess of a prescribed level effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising and were therefore incompatible with the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment permit a State to maintain fraud actions alleging that fundraisers made false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that, consistent with the Court\u0027s precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used. The Court reasoned that, while bare failure to disclose that information directly to potential donors does not suffice to establish fraud, when nondisclosure is accompanied by intentionally misleading statements designed to deceive the listener, the First Amendment does not preclude a fraud claim. Because the state\u0027s action was on misrepresentations that were not protected by freedom of speech, rather than the high percentage of donations retained, the Court concluded that the allegations against the telemarketers therefore state a claim for relief that can survive a motion to dismiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35578,"name":"M.

On appeal, the Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed Sattazahn\u0027s first-degree murder conviction and remanded for a new trial. At the second trial, Pennsylvania again sought the death penalty and the jury again convicted Sattazahn, but this time the jury imposed a death sentence. In affirming, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that neither the Fifth Amendment\u0027s Double Jeopardy Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause barred Pennsylvania from seeking the death penalty at the retrial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes either the Fifth Amendment\u0027s Double Jeopardy Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause bar a state from seeking the death penalty upon retrial where a statutory life sentence for murder was imposed after the jury was unable to agree on a sentence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that there was neither a Double Jeopardy Clause nor a Due Process Clause bar to Pennsylvania\u0027s seeking the death penalty on retrial. The Court reasoned that the death sentence on retrial did not implicate a double jeopardy bar because the life sentence at issue did not amount to an acquittal based on findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence or that the government failed to prove one or more aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court also refused to hold that the Due Process Clause provides greater double-jeopardy protection than does the Double Jeopardy Clause. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, and Stephen G.

Georgia\u0027s Republican governor objected to the plan because he said it violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which discourages the dilution of minority voting strength. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the legislature\u0027s plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the redistricting plan violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by spreading minority voters across several districts rather than concentrating them in a few heavily minority ones?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice O\u0027Connor, the Court held that the District Court failed to consider all the relevant factors when it examined whether Georgia\u0027s Senate plan resulted in a retrogression of black voters\u0027 effective exercise of the electoral franchise. The Court reasoned that Georgia likely met its burden of showing nonretrogression under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act because the District Court focused too narrowly on certain districts without examining the increases in the black voting age population that occurred in many of the other districts and improperly rejected evidence that the legislators representing the benchmark majority-minority districts support the plan. In his dissent, Justice David H. Souter argued that Georgia had failed to carry its burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21708,"name":"David F.

John Doe, a convicted sex offender who is subject to the law, filed suit, claiming that the law violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause. The District Court enjoined the law\u0027s public disclosure provisions. In affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that such disclosure violated the Due Process Clause because officials did not afford registrants a predeprivation hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause require that persons convicted of sexual offenses subject to Connecticut\u0027s \"Megan\u0027s Law\" receive a hearing before the public disclosure of their registry?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 9-0 opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the State\u0027s statutory scheme. The Court reasoned that, because the law was not based on an offender\u0027s dangerousness, but rather only on convictions, disclosing an offender on the registry without a hearing did not violate due process. The Court did not answer whether the law violated the substantive component of due process. Justices Antonin Scalia and David H. Souter filed concurring opinions.

Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, the U.S. Supreme Court held that amendments to the criminal code made by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) do not apply to cases pending in federal court on the AEDPA\u0027s effective date, April 24, 1996. Robert Garceau was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After his petition for state postconviction relief was denied, Garceau moved for the appointment of federal habeas counsel and a stay of execution in Federal District Court on May 12, 1995. He filed a federal habeas application on July 2, 1996. The District Court concluded that Garceau\u0027s habeas application was not subject to AEDPA because his motions for counsel and a stay were filed prior to that date. The Court of Appeals agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a federal habeas petition, which was filed after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 even though a stay and counsel were sought prior to that date, \"pending\" for the purposes of Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held, for purposes of Lindh, that a case does not become \"pending\" until an actual application for habeas corpus relief is filed in federal court. The Court reasoned that, because Garceau\u0027s federal habeas application was not filed until after AEDPA\u0027s effective date, it was subject to AEDPA\u0027s amendments. \"If, on [the effective date of the AEDPA], the state prisoner had before a federal court an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits of the petitioner\u0027s claims, then [the AEDPA] does not apply. Otherwise, an application filed after AEDPA\u0027s effective date should be reviewed under AEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant...were presented to a federal court prior to AEDPA\u0027s effective date.\" Justice David H.

The FMLA entitles an eligible employee to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave annually for the onset of a \"serious health condition\" in the employee\u0027s spouse. The Department granted Hibbs\u0027s request for the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave and, after he had exhausted that leave, informed him that he must report to work by a certain date. When Hibbs failed to do so, he was fired. Pursuant to FMLA provisions creating a private right of action \"against any employer\" that \"interfered with, restrained, or denied the exercise of\" FMLA rights, Hibbs sued in Federal District Court, seeking money damages for FMLA violations. The District Court concluded that the Eleventh Amendment barred the FMLA claim. The Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay an individual sue a State for money damages in federal court for violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that State employees may recover money damages in federal court in the event of the State\u0027s failure to comply with the FMLA\u0027s family-care provision. The Court reasoned that Congress both clearly stated its intention to abrogate the States\u0027 Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court under the FMLA and acted within its authority under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment by enacting prophylactic, rather than substantively redefining, legislation. \"In sum, the States\u0027 record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic [section] 5 legislation,\" wrote Chief Justice Rehnquist. Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, who was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Scalia, filed dissents.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38399,"name":"Paul G.

She filed a sexual discrimination lawsuit, charging that the firing was the culmination of discrimination that had occurred during her employment. Jurors during the trial were instructed by the judge to rule for Costa if they determined that sex was a motivating factor in the firing, even if other (legal) factors were present as well. The jury ruled for Costa. Desert Palace appealed, saying that the instructions incorrectly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant in the case. A three judge panel from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, ruling for the casino, but a subsequent review of the case by all 11 judges of the 11th Circuit reversed the panel\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust a plaintiff present direct evidence of discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that direct evidence is not required. Given that Title VII, on its face, does not mention that a plaintiff must make a heightened showing through direct evidence, the Court reasoned that in order to obtain an instruction a plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice.\" \"Because direct evidence of discrimination is not required in mixed-motive cases, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in giving a mixed-motive instruction to the jury,\" wrote Justice Thomas.

It also receives and manages Social Security benefits, which it uses to cover its costs, for many of those children. Such beneficiary children filed suit, alleging that the Department\u0027s use of their benefits to reimburse itself for the foster care costs violated the \"anti-attachment\" provision of Title II of the Social Security Act, which protects certain benefits from \"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.\" The trial court enjoined the Department from continuing to charge its foster care costs against Social Security benefits and ordered restitution of previous reimbursement transfers. The Washington Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the trial court\u0027s holding that the Department\u0027s practices violated the anti-attachment provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the State of Washington\u0027s use of foster childrens\u0027 Social Security benefits to reimburse itself for some of its expenditures violate the provision of the Social Security Act that protects benefits from \"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice David H. Souter, the Court held that the state\u0027s use of the Social Security benefits to reimburse itself does not violate the Social Security Act\u0027s anti-attachment provision. The Court reasoned that the Department\u0027s effort to become a representative payee and its use of Social Security benefits did not amount to employing an \"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\" within the meaning of the provision. The Court also noted that a ruing adverse to the state could disadvantage children in foster care.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38150,"name":"Patricia A.

Under the program, Maine attempts negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers. If a company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales are subjected to a prior authorization procedure that requires state agency approval to qualify a doctor\u0027s prescription for reimbursement. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers, challenged the program, claiming that it is pre-empted by the Medicaid Act and violates the Commerce Clause. Without resolving any factual issues, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction preventing the statute\u0027s implementation, concluding that any obstacle to the federal program\u0027s administration is sufficient to establish pre-emption. The Court of Appeals reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a Maine statute providing for affordable prescription drugs pre-empted by the Supremacy Clause? Does the statute violate the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In an opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held, 9-0, that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America had not carried its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits of its Commerce Clause claims and, 6-3, that their showing was insufficient to support a finding that the Medicaid Act pre-empts Maine\u0027s Rx Program insofar as it threatens to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices on non- Medicaid sales. The Court\u0027s decision upheld the Court of Appeal\u0027s reversal of the District Court\u0027s injunction. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, dissented from the plurality\u0027s opinion. \"By imposing prior authorization on Maine\u0027s Medicaid population to achieve wholly non-Medicaid related goals, Maine Rx \u0027stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u0027 of the federal Medicaid Act,\" argued Justice O\u0027Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

When the request was denied, the Sheriff\u0027s office obtained a warrant to search for the records at the casino. After the search, the tribe sued, claiming that it was a violation of their sovereign immunity. The district court ruled for Inyo County; a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel reversed, ruling for the Paiute-Shoshone tribe.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a federally recognized tribe qualify as a \"person\" who may sue under 42 USC section 1983? Does a tribe\u0027s suit qualify for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than section 1983?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo; the Court did not answer the second question. In a 9-0 opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that, in the situation presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a \"person\" who may sue under section 1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. The Court reasoned that section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, not to advance a sovereign\u0027s prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. Regarding the second question, the Court concluded that whether the Tribe\u0027s suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than section 1983 was an issue that required additional addressing and remanded the question. Justice John Paul Stevens filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38958,"name":"Reid Peyton Chambers","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/reid_peyton_chambers","view_count":0,"last_name":"Chambers","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"reid_peyton_chambers"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the respondents","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/18442"},{"advocate":{"ID":31308,"name":"John D.

After they filed the suit, the Bazzles learned that other Green Tree customers were dealing with the same sort of dispute. As a result, they asked for and received permission to file a class action suit. However, Green Tree contracts had a clause requiring that any contract disputes be settled by an arbitrator. Green Tree asked the court to revoke the class certification because the Federal Arbitration Act, it argued, did not permit class-wide arbitration. Instead, the arbitration would have to be conducted on a case-by-case basis. The South Carolina Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that, unless specifically banned in the contract, class-wide arbitration could be permitted by the courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Federal Arbitration Act permit class-wide arbitration hearings?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, delivered an opinion concluding that an arbitrator must determine whether the contracts forbid class arbitration. Justice Breyer reasoned that, because the question of what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to did not concern a state statute or judicial procedure, was well suited to be answered by an arbitrators, and was situated in sweeping language, the matter of contract interpretation should be for an arbitrator, not the courts, to decide. Justice John Paul Stevens filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part in order to establish a controlling judgment. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, joined by Justices Sandra Day O\u0027Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19848,"name":"Cornelia T. L.

Lawrence and Garner were arrested and convicted of deviate sexual intercourse in violation of a Texas statute forbidding two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. In affirming, the State Court of Appeals held that the statute was not unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/85-140\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBowers v.

Do their criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violate their vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? Should Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), be overruled?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes, and yes. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that the Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct violates the Due Process Clause. After explaining what it deemed the doubtful and overstated premises of Bowers, the Court reasoned that the case turned on whether Lawrence and Garner were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause. \"Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government,\" wrote Justice Kennedy. \"The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual,\" continued Justice Kennedy. Accordingly, the Court overruled Bowers. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, with whom Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Thomas joined, filed dissents.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38319,"name":"Paul M.

Subsequently, Dole impleaded Dead Sea Bromine Co. and Bromine Compounds, Ltd., or the Dead Sea Companies. Dole successfully removed the action to federal court, arguing that the federal common law of foreign relations provided federal-question jurisdiction. The District Court rejected the argument that the Dead Sea Companies were instrumentalities of a foreign state, Israel, as defined by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) and thus entitled to removal. In reversing, the Court of Appeals concluded that Dole could not base removal on the federal common law of foreign relations and that the Dead Sea Companies were not instrumentalities of Israel because they did not meet the FSIA\u0027s instrumentality definition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a corporate subsidiary claim instrumentality status where the foreign state does not own a majority of its shares but does own a majority of the shares of a corporate parent one or more tiers above the subsidiary? Is a corporation\u0027s instrumentality status defined as of the time an alleged tort or other actionable wrong occurred?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In an opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held, 7-2, that a foreign state must itself own a majority of the shares of a corporation if the corporation is to be deemed an instrumentality of the state under the provisions of the FSIA and, 9-0, that instrumentality status is determined at the time of the filing of the complaint. The Court reasoned that, as indirect subsidiaries of Israel, the Dead Sea Companies cannot come within the statutory language granting instrumentality status and that only direct ownership satisfies the statutory requirement. Concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, argued that the language \"other ownership interest...owned by a foreign state,\" covers a foreign state\u0027s legal interest in a corporate subsidiary, where that interest consists of the foreign state\u0027s ownership of a corporate parent that owns the shares of the subsidiary. As Dole did not seek review of the Court of Appeals\u0027 decision, the writ of certiorari in 01-593 was dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31723,"name":"Jonathan S.

(Alafabco) had multiple business dealings with each other spanning over a decade. In 1998, Alafabco bid on a construction job based on a contract it had with Citizens to finance the project. When Citizens did not finance the project, Alafabco used existing funds meant to repay the debts it owed to Citizens to fund the project and subsequently defaulted on its loan payments to Citizens. Citizens and Alafabco composed two different debt-restructuring agreements, both of which included arbitration clauses that stated that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) would apply. Alafabco sued Citizens in Alabama state court for breach of contract and claimed that it had incurred detrimental debt because of Citizens’ breach. Citizens invoked the arbitration clause, and the state court ordered the parties to submit to arbitration pursuant to their agreement. The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and held that, because the debt-restructuring agreements did not substantially involve interstate commerce, the FAA did not apply to the parties’ disputes.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a debt-restructuring agreement between two parties a transaction that substantially involves interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act may apply?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the unanimous Court held that the “involving commerce” language is the functional equivalent of the “affecting commerce” language that governs the federal government’s Commerce Clause power, but the FAA has even wider authority. Because debt-restructuring transactions would be determined to “affect commerce” under the Supreme Court’s Commerce Clause analysis, they clearly are within the wider range of permissible FAA regulation. The Court held that the lower court applied an overly narrow reading of the Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

When Henson successfully intervened in a similar action, Price v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., in federal district court, the Louisiana court stayed his state court claim. Although the ensuing settlement in Price stipulated that his state-court action be dismissed with prejudice, the Louisiana state court allowed Henson to proceed. Syngenta then removed the action to the federal District Court under the All Writs Act. The District Court dismissed the former state-court action as barred by the Price settlement. Vacating the dismissal, the Court of Appeals wrote that the All Writs Act could not properly support removal of the state-court action.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the All Writs Act give a federal district court the authority to remove a state-court case in order to prevent the frustration of orders the federal court has previously issued?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court held that the All Writs Act does not provide removal jurisdiction. The Court reasoned that, because the general removal statute requires that a federal court have original jurisdiction over an action in order for it to be removed from a state court, the All Writs Act, alone or in combination with the existence of ancillary jurisdiction in a federal court, is not a substitute for that requirement.

NASD\u0027s Code of Arbitration Procedure section 10304 states that no dispute \"shall be eligible for submission...where six (6) years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute.\" Dean Witter filed suit, asking the Federal District Court to declare the dispute ineligible for arbitration because it was more than six years old. The court dismissed the action, stating that the NASD arbitrator should interpret and apply the NASD rule. In reversing, the Court of Appeals found that the rule\u0027s application presented a question of the underlying dispute\u0027s arbitrability and the presumption is that a court will ordinarily decide an arbitrability question.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould a federal district court decide whether to interpret and apply the National Association of Securities Dealers\u0027 time-limit rule regarding disputes where six years have elapsed since the event that gives rise to the dispute?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-0 opinion delivered by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that the applicability of the NASD time-limit rule is a matter presumptively for the arbitrator. Justice Breyer reasoned that the issue did not raise a substantive question of arbitrability requiring judicial resolution. The NASD\u0027s time-limit rule \"falls within the class of gateway procedural disputes that do not present what our cases have called \u0027questions of arbitrability.\u0027 And the strong pro-court presumption as to the parties\u0027 likely intent does not apply,\" concluded Justice Breyer. Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the judgment. Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36594,"name":"Matthew D.

Ultimately, the Court of Appeals found that each class member was asserting a separate and distinct claim and that the individual claims did not satisfy the $75,000 amount-in-controversy requirement.

While some of the data is kept confidential, some, such as the offender\u0027s name, photograph, and physical description, is published on the Internet. The Act\u0027s requirements are retroactive. John Doe I and John Doe II were convicted of aggravated sex offenses before the Act\u0027s passage are thus covered by it. Both brought suit, seeking to declare the Act void as applied to them under the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I Section 10 of the United States Constitution. The District Court ruled against them and the Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that, because its effects were punitive, the Act violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I Section 10 prohibit the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act\u0027s registration requirement as a retroactive punishment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act\u0027s retroactive application does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because the act is nonpunitive. The Court reasoned that the act was clearly intended as a civil, non-punitive means of identifying previous offenders for the protection of the public. The Court also found that the stigma, which could result from registration, did not render the act effectively punitive, since the dissemination of the registration information did not constitute the imposition of any significant affirmative disability or restraint. Dissenting, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the act could only cover those convicted of offenses committed after the effective date of the act without violating the Ex Post Facto Clause. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, dissented, arguing that the act was \"ambiguous in intent and punitive in effect\" and that its retroactive application was incompatible with the Ex Post Facto Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21636,"name":"Darryl L.

They claimed that the ban violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and that it restricted their First Amendment right to association. The district court agreed, ruling against the ban. On appeal, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the district court\u0027s ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Department of Corrections ban on visits by minors violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment and the freedom of association of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 9-0 opinion delivered by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court held that the MDOC\u0027s regulations were valid. The Court reasoned that the fact that the regulations bear a rational relation to legitimate penological interests suffices to sustain them regardless of whether the prisoners have a constitutional right of association that has survived incarceration. The Court also concluded that the visitation restriction for inmates with two substance-abuse violations is not a cruel and unusual confinement condition violating the Eighth Amendment. The Court reasoned that withdrawing visitation privileges for a limited period is not a dramatic departure from accepted standards for confinement conditions. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42549,"name":"Thomas L.

The voters passed the referendum repealing the ordinance. The Foundation filed suit, claiming that by submitting the site plan to voters, the City violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair Housing Act. After the Ohio Supreme Court declared the referendum invalid under Ohio\u0027s Constitution, the District Court granted the City summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Appeals found that the Foundation had stated a valid Fair Housing Act claim and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the City had engaged in arbitrary and irrational government conduct in violation of substantive due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that a low-income housing foundation\u0027s suit against a city for violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair Housing Act could proceed to trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, the Court reversed the Court of Appeals with regard to the Foundation\u0027s equal protection and substantive due process claims and vacated the appellate court\u0027s Fair Housing Act holding. Noting that the Foundation claimed injury from the referendum petitioning process and not from the referendum itself, the Court reasoned that statements made by private individuals during a citizen-driven petition drive do not, in and of themselves, constitute state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.

Subsequently, lawsuits were filed in both the Mississippi State Chancery Court and the Federal District Court, asking that each court issue its own redistricting plan. While the federal court stayed its hand, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the Chancery Court had jurisdiction to issue a redistricting plan. The Chancery Court adopted such a plan, which was submitted for preclearance pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Meanwhile, the Federal District Court promulgated a plan that would fix the State\u0027s congressional districts for the 2002 elections should the state-court plan not be precleared by the state-law deadline. Ultimately, the District Court enjoined the State from using the state-court plan and ordered that its own plan be used in 2002 until the State produced a precleared, constitutional plan. The State did not appeal and no determination was made on the preclearance submission because the District Court\u0027s injunction rendered the state-court plan incapable of administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the District Court properly enjoin the Mississippi state court\u0027s proposed congressional redistricting plan and properly fashion its own congressional reapportionment plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a plurality opinion delivered by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held, 9-0, that the District Court properly enjoined enforcement of the state- court plan that lacked the required timely preclearance. The Court also held, 7-2, that the federal court properly fashioned its own congressional reapportionment plan, which drew the requisite single-member districts rather than directing at-large elections, under 2 USC section 2c. Regarding the second holding, Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, reasoned that the provision for at-large elections under 2 USC section 2a(c) was subject to the requirement under section 2c that single-member districts must be drawn whenever possible. Justice John Paul Stevens, with whom Justices David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer joined, concluded that section 2c impliedly repealed section 2a(c). Justice Sandra Day O\u0027Connor, with whom Justice Clarence Thomas joined, disagreed with the plurality\u0027s interpretations of section 2c.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":23555,"title":"Oral Argument - December 10, 2002","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23555"}],"citation":{"volume":"538","page":"254","year":"2003","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27068"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15049,"name":"Antonin Scalia","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/antonin_scalia","view_count":0,"last_name":"Scalia","roles":[{"id":2693,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":528094800,"date_end":1455343200,"appointing_president":"Ronald Reagan","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2693"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32678,"mime":"image/png","size":58944,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/antonin_scalia/antonin_scalia.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":10732,"identifier":"antonin_scalia"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"majority","seniority":4,"ideology":3,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/205075"},{"member":{"ID":15141,"name":"William H.
