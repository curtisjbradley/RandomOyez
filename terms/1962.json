In 1955, Don Gilmore and his wife, Dixie Gilmore, divorced. The trial court determined that the divorce was absolute without alimony for Dixie, which meant that Don successfully protected his assets from Dixie\u0027s claims that his assets were community property. Don\u0027s legal expenses totaled about $40,000 for the taxable years of 1953 and 1954. The Internal Revenue Code allows deductions from gross income for \"ordinary and necessary expenses incurred during the taxable year for the conservation of property held for the production of income.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilmore sued in the Court of Claims to recover alleged overpayment of income taxes related to the legal expenses incurred during the divorce. The Court of Claims held that the legal expenses were attributable to Gilmore\u0027s successful resistance of his wife\u0027s claims to certain assets and were therefore deductible for federal income tax purposes. However, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue found that these expenditures were personal or family expenses and therefore not deductible. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the question in the administration of the tax laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the origin and character of a claim control the basic test of whether the expense was \"business\" or \"personal\" and therefore whether it is deductible?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Marshall Harlan delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that the origin and character of a claim with respect to expense incurred, rather than its potential consequences for the taxpayer, controls the basic test of whether an expense is classified as business or personal; therefore legal expenses are deductible as expenses incurred for conservation of property held for production of income. Dixie Gilmore\u0027s claims stemmed from the marital relationship and not from income-producing activity; therefore the claims in this case were personal, rather than business, expenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their dissenting opinion, Justice Hugo L. Black and Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the majority opinion based its analysis on an unjustly narrow interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code. They argued that the legal expenses in this specific case should be considered business expenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43923,"name":"Wayne G.

While under arrest, Way told police that a man named “Blackie Toy” once sold him an ounce of heroin at his laundry on Leavenworth St.  Later that day, police found a laundry run by James Wah Toy.  Nothing on the record identified Toy as “Blackie Toy”, but police arrested him anyway.  Police then went to Toy’s house where they arrested Johnny Yee and found several tubes containing less than one ounce of heroin. Police also arrested Wong Sun.  Police interrogated the men and wrote statements in English for them to sign.  Both men refused, citing errors in the statements.  At trial in U.S. District Court, Toy and Sun were convicted on federal narcotics charges.  On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Were the petitioners\u0027 arrests lawful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Were the petitioners\u0027 unsigned statements admissible as evidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William J. Brennan wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court and remanding for a new trial.  The Supreme Court held that the police did not have probable cause to justify the arrests.  With regard to Toy, the court should exclude all evidence found during the search because they are the “fruits” of an unlawful search.   The unsigned statement was not corroborated, so it gave no basis for conviction.  Sun’s unsigned confession and evidence against him were admissible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark wrote a dissent, stating that the arrests were lawful and there was no reason to grant Sun a new trial.  Justices James M. Harlan, Potter Stewart, and Byron R.

After several hours of questioning, Townsend began going into withdrawal and asked for a doctor. A doctor gave him a medicine Townsend alleges was a \"truth serum.\" While under the influence of the medication, Townsend confessed to the murder. Townsend alleged that the medicine caused his confession and, therefore, was not admissible at trial. Defendants disputed most of the facts surrounding the confession. The Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois admitted the confession at a trial by jury. The jury found Townsend guilty and sentenced him to death. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTownsend subsequently petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed on the ground that the District Court\u0027s inquiry should be limited to undisputed portions of the record.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a Federal court required to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine issues of fact in order to rule on the writ of habeas corpus?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, when the facts are in dispute and the petitioner did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in state court. In a 5-4 decision, Justice Earl Warren wrote for the majority. At the state level, several crucial facts, such as whether or not the medicine given to Townsend was a \"truth serum,\" were not determined. The record did not provide sufficient information to make an accurate determination. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing. The Supreme Court was careful to note that it did not rule on the truth of the allegations in the petition for writ of habeas corpus. Justice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent, stating that the District Court had made sufficient factual determinations and a new hearing was unnecessary. Justice Tom C. Clark, Justice John M. Harlan, and Justice Byron R. White joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25682,"name":"George N.

Skrupa was in business as a \"Credit Advisor\" and engaged in this practice. A lower court held that the Kansas statute was an \"unreasonable regulation of a lawful business\" and struck it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Kansas regulation of debt adjusting violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court reversed the decision of the lower court and affirmed Kansas\u0027s right to regulate debt adjusting. The unanimous decision held that the question of whether the law was wise or reasonable was a legislative and not a judicial one. Justice Black argued that the lower court\u0027s ruling relied on old law; the Court had moved out of the business of using the \"vague contours\" of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down laws which it had deemed economically unwise. Those were issues for state and national legislatures to address and not the courts. As long as state regulations do not offend a \"specific federal constitutional prohibition\" or a \"valid federal law,\" they are legitimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14425,"title":"Oral Argument - March 20, 1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14425"}],"citation":{"volume":"372","page":"726","year":"1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25172"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Under this system, the candidate who received the highest number of votes in a county would receive all of that county\u0027s unit votes. The overall winning candidate would then have to receive a majority of the county unit votes statewide. This system ended up giving rural counties a majority of the unit votes, even though rural counties made up only about a third of the population as of the 1960s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1962, James O\u0027Hear Sanders, a voter in Georgia\u0027s most populous county, brought suit against several representatives of the Georgia State Democratic Executive Committee and the Secretary of State of Georgia. Sanders claimed that the county unit system violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment. As a voter within one of the urban counties, Sanders claimed his vote had less of an influence on the nomination of candidates than that of a rural voter. A special three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia agreed with Sanders and held that the county unit system violated the Equal Protection Clause. However, the district court did not outlaw the county unit system entirely. The State appealed directly to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the county unit voting system violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William O. Douglas, in an 8-1 majority opinion, vacated the lower court\u0027s judgment and remanded the case with directions. The Court held that the weighing of votes through the county unit system violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by giving more voting power to residents of particularly small rural counties. Unlike the district court, the majority held that the county unit system was impermissible in its entirety. The Court reasoned that the longstanding concept of political equality requires elections to be governed by the rule of \"one person, one vote.\" Justice John Marshall Harlan II dissented, arguing that the case should be sent back for trial to establish a fully developed record for the Court to review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14073,"title":"Oral Argument - January 17, 1963 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14073"},{"id":14491,"title":"Oral Argument - January 17, 1963 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14491"}],"citation":{"volume":"372","page":"368","year":"1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25173"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

H. Kress and Company operated a general variety store on Main Street in Durham, North Carolina. On the first floor, Kress had a stand-up counter where it served food and drinks to both black and white customers. On the basement floor, however, Kress operated a luncheonette department with signs posted stating that it was for employees and invited guests only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn May 6, 1960, seven students tried to seat themselves at the luncheonette counter. Five, including John Thomas Avent, were black students at North Carolina College for Negroes in Durham. The other two were white students at Duke University. All seven were involved with civil rights student organizations to varying degrees. Before each sat down, the store’s manager W. K. Boger spoke with the students individually. He told them that the luncheonette department was for employees and invited guests only, and asked them to leave. Both white students, however, were only asked to leave when it became clear they were sitting with one or more black customers. When the students refused to leave, Boger called an officer of the Durham police department, who arrested the students and charged them with trespassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Boger testified that it was Kress’ policy to refuse service to black customers at the luncheonette department, and to refuse service to white people in the company of black people. The district court convicted all seven defendants of trespassing. On appeal, the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the ruling. Noting that North Carolina had no laws mandating the separation of white and black customers in restaurants, the court upheld proprietors’ common law right to exclude individuals on the basis of race.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit a white operator of a diner from barring black customers from a “whites only” section of the store?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the Court vacated the North Carolina Supreme Court’s judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of its decisions in \u003ci\u003ePeterson v. City of Greenville\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ePatterson v. Alabama\u003c/i\u003e In \u003ci\u003ePeterson\u003c/i\u003e, the Court held that states cannot use trespass laws to enforce discrimination mandated by a segregation ordinance.

The school district sought to enjoin enforcement of the statute. The district court ruled that the statute violated the First Amendment, even after the statute had been amended to permit a student to excuse himself. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court consolidated this case with one involving Maryland atheists who challenged a city rule that provided for opening exercises in the public schools that consisted primarily of reading a chapter from the bible and the Lord\u0027s Prayer. The state\u0027s highest court held the exercise did not violate the First Amendment. The religious character of the exercise was admitted by the state. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Pennsylvania law requiring public school students to participate in classroom religious exercises violate the religious freedom of students as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003ePublic schools cannot sponsor Bible readings and recitations of the Lord’s Prayer under the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Clark, the majority concluded that, in both cases, the laws required religious exercises and such exercises directly violated the First Amendment. The Court affirmed the Pennsylvania decision, and reversed and remanded the Maryland decision because the mandatory reading from the bible before school each day was found to be unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart dissented, expressing the view that on the records it could not be said that the Establishment Clause had necessarily been violated. He would remand both cases for further hearings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14966,"title":"Oral Argument, Part 1: Murray v.

Haynes near a gas station that had just been robbed. Haynes admitted to the robbery as officers drove him to the police station, and he signed a written confession after he was told that he could not call his wife until he signed it. At trial, Haynes argued that the confession was inadmissible because it was involuntary and coerced. The judge admitted the confession into evidence, and the jury found Haynes guilty. Haynes appealed, and the Washington Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the lower court’s admission of the signed confession violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Arthur J. Goldberg delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the Spokane police officers extracted an involuntary confession from Haynes by threatening to hold him without allowing him to contact his family. The Court also held that such tactics were unnecessary because the police had sufficient evidence to charge Haynes with robbery even without the confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark wrote a dissent in which he distinguished the officers’ refusal to allow Haynes to call his wife from the voluntariness of the confession. The oral confession that Haynes made within the first ninety minutes of his arrest bolstered Justice Clark’s view that the signed written confession was also voluntary. Justice Clark argued that the officers’ treatment of Haynes did not amount to threats or inducements and that Haynes was an unlikely candidate for coercion given his age, intelligence, and prior criminal record. Justice John M. Harlan, Justice Potter Stewart, and Justice Byron R. White joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35097,"name":"Lawrence Speiser","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/lawrence_speiser","view_count":0,"last_name":"Speiser","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"lawrence_speiser"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21559"},{"advocate":{"ID":25605,"name":"George A.

When he appeared in court without a lawyer, Gideon requested that the court appoint one for him. According to Florida state law, however, an attorney may only be appointed to an indigent defendant in capital cases, so the trial court did not appoint one. Gideon represented himself in trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. Gideon filed a habeas corpus petition in the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that the trial court\u0027s decision violated his constitutional right to be represented by counsel. The Florida Supreme Court denied habeas corpus relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Sixth Amendment\u0027s right to counsel in criminal cases extend to felony defendants in state courts?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Sixth Amendment\u0027s guarantee of a right to assistance of counsel applies to criminal defendants in state court by way of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Hugo L. Black, the Court held that it was consistent with the Constitution to require state courts to appoint attorneys for defendants who could not afford to retain counsel on their own. The Court reasoned that the Sixth Amendment\u0027s guarantee of counsel is a fundamental and essential right made obligatory upon the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused the right to the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions and requires courts to provide counsel for defendants unable to hire counsel unless the right was competently and intelligently waived. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Douglas, while joining the Court\u0027s opinion, elaborated, in a separate opinion, the relation between the Bill of Rights and the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Clark and Harlan concurred in separate decisions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15061,"name":"Abe Fortas","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/abe_fortas","view_count":0,"last_name":"Fortas","roles":[{"id":2705,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-133902000,"date_end":-20026800,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

Davis visited Clauson’s Inn, located in North Falmouth, Massachusetts, as part of an investigation into possible tax evasion. He spoke with German S. Lopez, who operated the inn, to determine whether there was any dancing or other form of evening entertainment. Lopez denied it, but when Davis returned later that night, he saw dancing in the lounge and bar. On October 21, Davis returned to tell Lopez that the Inn might owe a cabaret tax and requested the Inn’s financial records. Lopez suggested that the two could reach an “agreement” and offered Davis $420 with a promise of more money if he dropped the issue. In Lopez’s version of the events, the money was for Davis to prepare the paperwork and put the Inn’s books in order. Lopez agreed to file paperwork for the current quarter and asked Davis to come back on October 24. Davis reported the meeting and turned the money over to his superior. When he returned on October 24, Davis wore a recording device. As they discussed Lopez’s tax liability, Lopez emphasized that he wanted Davis “on [his] side” and gave him more money. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez was charged with four counts of attempted bribery of an internal revenue agent. Prior to trial, Lopez filed a motion to suppress the recorded evidence, and the motion was denied. He was convicted on three of the counts in district court. Although the defense did not focus on entrapment, the trial court judge provided jury instructions on the issue. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the IRS agent’s actions toward the petitioner constitute entrapment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was the use of the wire recording of a conversation between the petitioner and the IRS agent as evidence a violation of the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No. Justice John M. Harlan delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that entrapment only occurs when law enforcement professionals purposefully induce the commission of a crime. The petitioner’s offers of bribery happened before the agent responded in any favorable way, so the agent did not entrap the petitioner. Since the petitioner did not object to the jury instruction on entrapment at the time, he could not retroactively object. The Court also held that the wire recordings did not result from Davis misrepresenting himself. Lopez knew that Davis could use his statements against him if he chose to do so. The device only served to reliably record a conversation in which a government agent was a legal participant. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that the advances in recording technology required the Court to be vigilant about monitoring the constitutionality of their usage. In this case, he held that the recording only corroborated the legal testimony of the agent and was therefore admissible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent where he stated that this case followed in the vein of \u003ci\u003eOn Lee v. United States\u003c/i\u003e, and both cases were wrongly decided. He argued that the recording was not merely a corroboration of earlier evidence but “independent third-party evidence.” He argued that the use of electronic recording devices revived the evils of the general warrant, which the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were written to prevent. He also argued that, in a conversation, the speaker assumes the risk that the other participant might repeat the conversation, but a wire recording adds a third party and another risk to the speaker’s privacy that he did not assume. Justice William O. Douglas and Justice Arthur J. Goldberg joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22191,"name":"Edward J.

The federal Secretary of Agriculture used a different system for determining the maturity of avocados that were grown in Florida. Oil content was not a factor in these standards. Florida avocado growers tried to prevent the enforcement of the California law against them with regard to avocados that met the federal standard for maturity but did not have the oil level required by the California law. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the California law prohibiting the sale or transportation of certain avocados within its borders constitutionally valid?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003ePreemption does not arise if there is no direct conflict between federal and state laws, meaning that it is possible to comply with both of them simultaneously, and if the state law does not frustrate the purpose of the federal law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice William Brennan, the Court held that federal law will preempt a state law if it is physically impossible to comply with both laws. In this situation, it would be possible to comply with both laws, since the Florida growers could have met the California standard if they had allowed their avocados more time to grow. This means that there was no inherent conflict between the two laws. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices White, Black, Douglas, and Clark dissented on the ground that the California statute was invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13949,"title":"Oral Argument - January 08, 1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13949"}],"citation":{"volume":"373","page":"132","year":"1963","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25262"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The rate increase was based on the expected cost of service and rate of return. The Commission imposed a five-month suspension period while hearings were conducted to determine whether the rate increase was reasonable. At the end of five months, the new rates would be applied, but they were subject to refund if the hearings found a reasonable rate lower than 7%. On August 9, 1960, the Commission found that only a 6 1/8% increase was reasonable and that Tennessee Gas must provide refunds. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTennessee Gas challenged the ruling by arguing that requiring a refund prior to a final determination of cost made the company unable to recoup its 6 1/8%. Because Tennessee Gas spreads its rates differently across the different zones, there are certain zones in which the refund would be greater than the value of the new rate. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found in favor of Tennessee Gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the Federal Power Commission order a rates reduction and refund without determining how such a reduction would affect costs in different service zones?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Tom C. Clark delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that it is the company’s responsibility to determine a rate schedule that is “just and reasonable” in order to prevent the Commission from ordering a change. Additionally, since the company cannot expect to be able to recoup the losses it accrues during the five-month suspension period, it should not expect to recoup the losses during the readjustment period either. The Court also held that the Commission acted properly in order to protect consumers from excessive rates and charges, because Tennessee Gas was attempting to collect on an illegally high rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40542,"name":"Ralph S.

Brady maintained that he participated in the preceding robbery, but not in the killing.  At sentencing, both men received the death penalty.  After trial, Brady learned that Boblit previously confessed to the murder, but the prosecution suppressed that evidence for Brady’s trial.  On appeal, the Maryland Court of Appeals held that suppression of the confession denied Brady due process and remanded the case to reconsider the question of punishment only.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the prosecution’s suppression of Boblit’s confession deny Brady due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was the Maryland Court of Appeals wrong to remand only on the question of punishment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No.  In a 7-2 decision, Justice William O. Douglas wrote the majority opinion affirming the state court.  The Supreme Court held that the prosecution\u0027s suppression of evidence violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court also held that according the Maryland state law, the confession would not exonerate Brady, so a remand only for reconsidering his punishment was proper.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21826,"name":"E.

The complaint asked the court to allow the United States to have the validity of any claims determined through administrative proceedings before the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior. Respondents sued to enjoin the administrative proceedings, but the District Court granted the United States summary judgment, holding that the court should wait for the administrative determination before proceeding with any mining claim. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, stating that because the United States initiated the condemnation suit in District Court, the validity of mining claims must be left to the judiciary.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court act within its discretion when it refused to judge Respondent\u0027s claim until there was an administrative determination on the claim\u0027s validity?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William O. Douglas wrote for a unanimous court holding that the administrative proceedings were proper.

The demonstrators protested against the park\u0027s policy \"not to have colored people on the rides, or in the park.\" During the demonstration, William Griffin and four other Negroes entered the park to test its management\u0027s resolve. A state deputy, who worked as a security staff member in the park, soon observed them. After informing them of the park\u0027s racial policy, the deputy asked them to leave. When Griffin and his friends refused, they were arrested and later convicted for criminal trespass. State appellate courts affirmed the convictions.

The Court held that the arresting deputy, despite working as a private park employee at the time, possessed and acted under state authority, imputing responsibility for his actions to Maryland.
