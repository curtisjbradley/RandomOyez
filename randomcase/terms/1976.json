Bradley (1973) _, the Court ruled that an inter-district desegregation plan in the city of Detroit was impermissible and remanded the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The District Court ordered remedial education programs be instituted within the Detroit school district, and that the State of Michigan would bear half the costs of the remedial programs. The state of Michigan challenged the District Court order, which was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeal for the Sixth Circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Can a federal district court order remedial education programs for students who had been subjected to segregation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Can a federal district court order the state of Michigan to bear some of the costs of the remedial programs without violating Michigan\u0027s immunity from suit established by the Eleventh Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. In a unanimous decision, the Court affirmed the District Court order, emphasizing \"equitable principles\" in the construction of desegregation plans set forth in \u003cem\u003eBrown v. Board of Education (1955) _. The Court relied on _United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e in that \"matters other than pupil assignment must on occasion be addressed by federal courts to eliminate the effects of prior segregation\" and numerous lower court decisions providing for remedial programs. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger asserted that the District Court order \"does no more than\" what was accepted in \u003cem\u003eEx Parte Young\u003c/em\u003e. The burden to eliminate the effects of segregation rested on state officials, consistent with \u003cem\u003eSwann v. Charlotte- Mecklenburg Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e. Therefore, the District Court\u0027s order did not violate the Eleventh Amendment. Justice Thurgood Marshall authored a concurring opinion. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24203,"name":"Frank J.

Nixon resigned as President of the United States on August 9, 1974, leaving in government custody approximately 42 million pages of documents, 880 reels of tape recordings of conversations, and other materials. Soon after, Nixon executed a depository agreement with the Administrator of General Services Administration providing for the storage of these materials near Nixon’s California home; this agreement also specified that certain of the materials would be destroyed at Nixon’s discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after this agreement was publicized, the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act became law. The act directed the Administrator to take custody of Nixon’s presidential materials, assign government archivists to screen materials for items that were personal or private in nature, preserve materials with historical value, and make materials available for use in judicial proceedings. The act also directed the Administrator to promulgate regulations allowing eventual public access to the materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day after President Ford signed the act into law, Nixon challenged its constitutionality in district court, claiming that it violated 1) the principle of separation of powers, 2) Nixon’s presidential privilege, 3) Nixon’s privacy interests, 4) Nixon’s First Amendment associational rights, and 5) the bill of attainder clause. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the act. The district court dismissed Nixon’s compliant, holding that his constitutional challenges were without merit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Was the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the separation of powers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Was the act unconstitutional on its face as a violation of presidential privilege doctrines?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Was the act unconstitutional on its face as a violation of Nixon’s privacy interests?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Was the act unconstitutional on its face as a violation of Nixon’s First Amendment right to free association?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Was the act unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the Bill of Attainder Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003e\"\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, no, no, and no. In a 7-2 decision written by Justice William Brennan, the Court held that the act did not violate any of Nixon’s relevant constitutional rights. Justice Brennan first determined that the district court correctly limited the scope of its review to the constitutional consequences of the archival screenings because the Administrator had not yet promulgated any regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Brennan rejected Nixon’s claim that the act violated the constitutional separation of powers, focusing on whether the act prevented the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions. He noted that the act placed custody of the materials in officials also of the executive branch, and that the materials could only be released if that action was not barred by some applicable executive privilege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Brennan rejected Nixon’s claim that presidential privilege barred archival scrutiny of the materials. He noted that presidential immunity was generally qualified, and that the screening constituted a very limited intrusion by executive branch personnel into executive matters. Moreover, the intrusion was justified by a clear public interest in preserving materials for legitimate historical and governmental purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Brennan held that the act did not violate Nixon’s right to privacy. He weighed the potential intrusion into Nixon’s privacy against the public interest in subjecting the materials to archival screening. He noted that only a small fraction of the materials in question related to personal matters, and that the act provided procedures for the expressed purpose of minimizing intrusions into Nixon’s private and personal matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Brennan held that the act did not violate Nixon’s right to associational privacy under the First Amendment. He acknowledged that Nixon as President was the head of the national Republican Party and that the First Amendment closely protects involvement in partisan polities. Here, however, archival screening was apparently the least restrictive means of meeting the compelling government interests promoted by the act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Justice Brennan rejected Nixon’s argument that the act was a bill of attainder that legislatively determined guilt and inflicted punishment on Nixon without provision of the protections of a judicial trial. He concluded that the act did not impose any punishment traditionally judged to be prohibited by the bill of attainder clause, that the act was justified by Nixon’s plan to eventually destroy some of the materials, and that the legislative history did not indicate an intent to punish Nixon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White concurred in part and in the judgment. With respect to the bill of attainder issue, Justice White argued that it was sufficient to demonstrate that the act did not impose any punishment on Nixon. He questioned the majority’s assumption that the government’s interest in historical preservation could be important enough in itself to entitle it to Nixon’s private communications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred. He outlined the history of bill of attainders, pointing out that they were generally directed at formerly powerful political actors. Here, however, the facts provided a legitimate justification for the specificity of the act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry Blackmun concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He described his posture as essentially similar to that of Justice Louis Powell, but did not share his view that the President Carter’s agreement with the position of the Administrator was dispositive of the separation-of-powers issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Louis Powell concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. Justice Powell emphasized the uniqueness of the situation leading to the act’s signing, and the importance of safeguarding the materials. Regarding the separation of powers issue, Justice Powell considered it dispositive that President Carter represented through his Solicitor General that the act serves the executive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren Burger dissented. He argued that the act was an unconstitutional congressional violation of separation of powers. He highlighted the historical importance of presidential freedom from control or coercion by Congress, and characterized the act as an attempt by Congress to exercise the executive power to control executive materials, some of which were confidential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Rehnquist dissented, characterizing the question as whether congress has the right to seize the official papers of an outgoing president as he is leaving the inaugural stand. He emphasized the importance of candid and open discourse in the executive branch and the potential effect of the act on the free flow of information to and from the President. He rejected the majority’s balancing of the violation of separation of powers against the public interests allegedly furthered by the act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27551,"name":"Herbert J.

Because the crimes were committed on an Indian reservation, the three were subject to federal prosecution under the Major Crimes Act. They were indicted by a grand jury and tried for burglary, robbery, and murder. Leonard Davison and Antelope were found guilty on all three charges, and William Davison was found guilty of second-degree murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe defendants appealed and argued that their convictions under federal law were the result of unlawful racial discrimination. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the convictions and held that the defendants were placed at a “racially based disadvantage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo federal criminal statutes that subject individuals to federal prosecution based on their status as American Indians violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 9-0 majority. The Court held that the law and the courts have treated American Indian tribes as unique entities, and this treatment has been upheld against claims of racial discrimination. The Court also held that Congress has the authority to legislate over reservation territory, and as long as the Congressional legislation is fair, it does not violate Equal Protection to try individuals under the federal laws rather than the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33397,"name":"John W.

The only unit having a writ room and some semblance of a legal library was the Central Prison in Raleigh. Robert Smith, Donald W. Morgan, and John Harrington were all inmates in the DoC’s custody. In consolidated cases, the plaintiffs alleged that the state of North Carolina failed to provide its prisoners with proper legal facilities. They argued that this violated their right of access to the courts guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, ordering the responsible state officials to submit a proposed plan to provide library facilities for the use of indigent prisoners seeking to file pro se habeas or civil rights actions, or to provide some acceptable substitute. The court suggested that the state could fulfill its obligations by making legal counsel or assistance available, but did not mandate this approach. In response, the state proposed to construct seven new law libraries within the prison system, to expand the facilities at Central Prison, and to provide all inmates with access to these libraries upon request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plaintiffs protested that the plan was inadequate, but the court rejected their objections. It held that North Carolina was not constitutionally required to provide legal assistance as well as libraries. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, affirmed, but held that the plan failed to provide female prisoners with the same access as male prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the First and Fourteenth Amendments require the North Carolina Department of Corrections to assist inmates in the preparation and filing of legal papers by providing adequate law libraries or adequate legal assistance?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 decision written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court held that the constitution required the North Carolina Department of Correction to provide prisoners with legal assistance as part of prisoners’ right of access to the courts. Justice Marshall emphasized that prisoners have a well-established right of adequate, effective and meaningful access to the courts. He wrote that this access generally required states to shoulder affirmative obligations to provide meaningful access, including paying for trial counsel for indigent clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Marshall acknowledged that habeas corpus and civil rights complaints only needed to set forth facts giving rise to the complaint, but rejected North Carolina’s argument that law libraries or legal assistance were not essential to frame those complaints. A typical client would expect any lawyer preparing either complaint to research the law to determine whether an actionable claim existed. Justice Marshall rejected the state’s argument that inmates were ill-equipped to use the tools of the trade of the legal profession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Marshall also rejected North Carolina’s interpretation of \u003ci\u003eRoss v. Moffitt\u003c/i\u003e, where the Court held that prisoners’ right to appointed counsel in appeals to criminal cases was limited. Here, the Court was concerned with prisoners seeking new trials, release from confinement, or vindication of fundamental civil rights. Justice Marshall noted that adequate law libraries were only one constitutionally acceptable method of assuring meaningful access to the courts. Finally, he rejected the state’s argument that the district court exceeded its powers by ordering North Carolina to devise a remedy for the violation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Louis Powell concurred, emphasizing that the majority’s holding did not pass on the kinds of claims that state or federal courts were constitutionally required to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren Burger dissented. He could not determine the source of the constitutional right of access to the courts, or of the requirement that the states foot the bill for assuring that access for prisoners. Chief Justice Burger noted that the right of prisoners to collaterally attack convictions was derived from federal statutes and not from the constitution itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Rehnquist dissented, joined by Chief Justice Burger. He characterized the majority’s opinion as a reiteration of the reasoning in \u003ci\u003eYounger v. Gilmore\u003c/i\u003e, where the Court also failed to identify a constitutional source for prisoners’ right of access to the courts. He emphasized that lawful imprisonment properly resulted in a retraction of prisoners\u0027 rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32898,"name":"Jacob L.

Mathiason came freely, spoke with the officer, and was not arrested at the time. He was arrested later and a trial court used evidence obtained during the questioning to convict him. Mathiason moved to suppress the evidence since he was not read his Miranda rights before the questioning. The court admitted the evidence since Mathiason was not in custody during the questioning. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court of Oregon reversed since it found that Matianson was in a \"coercive environment\" when questioned and therefore deserved to hear his Miranda rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan incriminating evidence obtained from a suspect during a voluntary interview be used if the police did not read Miranda rights to the suspect?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam decision, the Court held that its decision in \u003cem\u003eMiranda v. Arizona\u003c/em\u003e only required law enforcement officials to recite a suspect\u0027s rights when suspect had been \"deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\" The Court determined that in this case there was \"no indication that the questioning took place in a context where respondent\u0027s freedom to depart was restricted in any way.\" Even if the police coercively pressured Mathiason during the interview, he came to the police station freely and was free to leave at any time.

The Department had a minimum height and weight requirement of 120 pounds and 5 feet 2 inches.  Rawlinson did not meet the minimum weight requirement, so the Department refused to hire her.  Rawlinson sued on behalf of herself and all similarly-situated women under Title VII, alleging sex discrimination.  While this suit was pending, the Alabama Board of Corrections adopted a rule banning women from working in “contact positions” that require close physical proximity to inmates.  Rawlinson amended her complaint to challenge the new rule as well.  The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama ruled in favor of Rawlinson.  The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Do the height and weight requirements violate Title VII?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the ban on women in “contact positions” violate Title VII?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No.  In a 7-2 decision, Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion affirming in part and reversing in part.  The Supreme Court held that the height and weight requirements violated Title VII because Rawlinson showed that the requirement excluded 41% of females in the nation, and the Department was unable to show that the requirement was job-related.  The “contact position” ban was a bona fide occupational qualification, however, so Title VII did not prohibit it.  The Court held that having women in these positions would create substantial security and safety problems.  Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a concurrence, agreeing that the “contact position” ban relates to a bona fide occupational qualification, but stating that the district court should have analyzed the height and weight requirement in more depth.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a partial dissent, agreeing that the height and weight requirements violated Title VII, but expressing that the ban on women in “contact positions” is also prohibited.  Justice William J. Brennan joined in the concurrence.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, stating that showing that the general height and weight statistics do not establish a valid case.  Rawlinson also hadn’t proved she was denied employment under the “contact position” rule because she didn’t meet the height and weight requirement in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25234,"name":"G.

The Court noted that nearly all states at that time declined to impose such a harsh penalty, with Georgia being the only state that authorized death for the rape of an adult woman.

Bates was a partner in a law firm which sought to provide low-cost legal services to people of moderate income who did not qualify for public legal aid. Bates and his firm would only accept routine legal matters (many of which did not involve litigation) and depended on a large number of patrons given the low financial return from each client. In assessing their concept of legal services, Bates\u0027s firm decided that it would be necessary to advertise its availability and low fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Arizona rule, which restricted legal advertising, violate the freedom of speech of Bates and his firm as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that the rule violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Justice Blackmun argued that commercial speech does merit First Amendment protection given the important functions it serves in society, such as providing consumers with information about services and products, and helping to allocate resources in the American system of free-enterprise. The Court held that allowing attorneys to advertise would not harm the legal profession or the administration of justice, and, in fact, would supply consumers with valuable information about the availability and cost of legal services.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44229,"name":"William C.

Wade, abortion opponents turned to state and local legislators in an effort to curb the practice of abortion.

Justice Powell argued that in its provisions, Title XIX of the Social Security Act made no specific reference to abortion nor did it require states to fund every medical procedure which could possibly fall under its umbrella. Powell made clear however that the federal statute did give states the option to fund therapeutic abortions if they chose to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29466,"name":"Judd F.

Washington State growers (whose standards are higher than the USDA) challenged the regulation as an unreasonable burden to interstate commerce. North Carolina stated it was a valid exercise of its police powers to create \"uniformity\" to protect its citizenry from \"fraud and deception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the North Carolina regulation violate the Commerce Clause by placing an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court voted unanimously that the North Carolina regulation was an unconstitutional exercise of the state\u0027s power over interstate commerce. Although the regulation was facially neutral, it had a discriminatory impact on the Washington growers while shielding the local growers from the same burden. The regulation removed the competitive advantage gained by the Washington apples from stricter inspection standards. The regulation produced a leveling effect that works to the local advantage by \"downgrading\" apples from other states unjustly. Therefore, the regulation places an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31147,"name":"John R.

This violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The government provided statistical evidence of the number of African American teachers hired. The district court entered summary judgment for Hazelwood, finding that the government’s evidence did not establish a pattern or practice of discrimination. The court compared the number of African American teachers hired to the number of African American students in the school district. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the proper statistical comparison is between the number of African American teachers on staff and the number of qualified African American individuals in the relevant labor market. The relevant labor market included St. Louis and the county where Hazelwood was located. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes congress have the authority to prohibit racial discrimination under Title VII absent proof that a governmental agency purposely discriminated on the basis of race?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan a court rely on statistical evidence to find prima facie case of race discrimination?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for an 8-1 majority, vacated the Eighth Circuit judgment.  The Supreme Court held that the court of appeals used the correct statistical comparison, but erred in determining the relevant labor market.  The court of appeals also failed to consider that Hazelwood may have been able to rebut some of the statistics with evidence of its hiring practices post Title VII.  The Court remanded the case for further consideration of the relevant labor market.  Justice William J. Brennan concurred, stating that the case was properly remanded so the parties could address the statistical data with more care.  Justice Byron R. White also concurred, writing that the government should have produced evidence of the racial makeup of Hazelwood’s applicant pool to compare with the racial makeup of those hired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented, arguing that the government proved discrimination through statistical data, historical evidence, and evidence relating to specific acts.  The school district failed to rebut that proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35240,"name":"Lawrence G.

Three years later, Sylvania franchised a San Francisco area company, Young Brothers, which was located only one mile from one of their existing franchises, Continental T.V., Inc. (Continental). Continental protested that the Young Brothers franchise violated Sylvania’s new location restrictions. When Sylvania ignored their protests, Continental tried to acquire more Sylvania televisions to sell in a new retail location in Sacramento. Sylvania already had retailers near Continental’s new Sacramento location and declined to supply them with more televisions, so Continental withheld payments they owed Sylvania under an existing franchise agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContinental sued in district court and alleged that Sylvania’s franchise agreements, which placed location-based restrictions on the sale of their products, violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Sherman Act). A jury found that Sylvania’s location restrictions violated the per se rule established in \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Arnold, Schwinn, \u0026amp; Co.\u003c/em\u003e that prohibited manufacturers from “restrict[ing] and confin[ing] areas or persons with whom an article may be traded after the manufacturer has parted with dominion over it.” Sylvania appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which declined to apply the per se rule. Instead, the appellate court distinguished this case from \u003cem\u003eSchwinn\u003c/em\u003e, applied a reasonableness rule, and held that Sylvania’s restrictions “had less potential for competitive harm than” other invalidated restrictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a per se rule barring a manufacturer from restricting the locations where retailers can sell the manufacturer’s products the appropriate rule to evaluate location restrictions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 6-2 majority. The Court held that the per se rule established in \u003cem\u003eSchwinn applied to this case. However, the Court found that the \u003cem\u003eSchwinn rule was outdated and overbroad; therefore, the Court overturned the rule in favor of a reasonableness standard. That standard considered whether the franchise agreement was an unreasonable restriction of competition and whether it had any redeeming virtue. The Court ruled that the appellate court properly applied this reasonableness rule and upheld Sylvania’s restrictions.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment but arguing that the Court should not have gone as far as to overturn the per se rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented and argued that the Court should not have overturned the per se rule and should have rejected Sylvania’s restrictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H.

Soon thereafter, a 10-year-old girl disappeared from the YMCA while at her brother’s wrestling match.  A boy in the parking lot saw Williams carrying a large bundle to his car with two “skinny and white” legs in it.  The next day, police found Williams’ abandoned car about 160 miles east of Des Moines.  Williams soon turned himself in to police in Davenport, Iowa.  Williams said he would tell police the whole story once he saw his lawyer in Des Moines.  Williams spoke with a local attorney and reiterated his intention to confess when he saw his attorney in Des Moines.  Davenport police promised not to question Williams during the drive to Des Moines. During the drive, however, the detective, knowing that Williams was deeply religious, told Williams that the girl’s family wanted to give her a “Christian burial” and suggested that they stop to locate the body.  As a result of the officer\u0027s pointed statements, Williams made incriminating statements and ultimately led police to the girl’s body. He was indicted for first-degree murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Williams moved to suppress all evidence relating to the car ride conversation, arguing that the questioning violated Williams’ Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The judge denied the motion, and a jury found Williams guilty.  The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.  Williams petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.  The court granted the writ, finding that speaking to Williams during the drive violated his right to counsel, and the evidence in question was wrongly admitted at trial.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Was Williams denied counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did Williams waive his right to counsel when he led the detective to the girl’s body?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No. In a 5-4 decision, Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, affirming the Court of Appeals.  The Supreme Court held police denied Williams his Sixth Amendment rights because the adversary proceeding had already began.  The detective’s statements eliciting incriminating statements amounted to an interrogation, entitling Williams to counsel.  The Court also held that Williams had not waived his right to counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall concurred, writing that the detective who gave the \"Christian burial\" speech knowingly set out to violate Williams’ constitutional rights.  The nature of the crime was not an excuse for the detective’s behavior.  Justice Lewis F. Powell also concurred, stating that the record clearly showed that Williams had not waived his rights.  Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurrence, expressing that the state had promised not to question Williams before he reached Des Moines, and the state could not dishonor that promise made to Williams’ lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger dissented, writing that Williams validly waived his right to counsel, and even if he had not, the disclosures he made were voluntary and uncoerced.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, stating that the record showed Williams knowingly and intentionally waived his rights.  Justices Harry A. Blackmun and William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a separate dissent, stating that there was no interrogation, and he would remand the case to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the Williams made the incriminating statements voluntarily.  Justices Byron R. White and William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40779,"name":"Richard N.

A free-lance reporter for Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. recorded the performance in its entirety without consent and it aired on the nightly news. Subsequently, Zacchini sued Scripps-Howard, alleging the unlawful appropriation of his professional property. Ultimately, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in favor of Scripps-Howard. While recognizing that Zacchini had a cause of action for the infringement of his state-law right to publicity, the court found that Scripps-Howard was constitutionally privileged to include in its newscasts matters of public interest that would otherwise be protected by the right of publicity, absent an intent to injure or to appropriate for some nonprivileged purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the First and Fourteenth Amendments immunize the Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. from damages for its alleged infringement of an entertainer\u0027s state-law right of publicity?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion delivered by Justice Byron R. White, the Court held that Scripps-Howard\u0027s constitutionally privileged free speech did not extend to broadcasting Zacchini\u0027s entire performance without his permission. Noting that Zacchini\u0027s interest in the case was similar to a patent or copyright, in which he was seeking to obtain the benefit of his work, the Court emphasized that the broadcast of an entire act was categorically different from reporting on an event in so far as it posed a substantial threat to the economic value of the performance. \"Wherever the line in particular situations is to be drawn between media reports that are protected and those that are not, we are quite sure that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not immunize the media when they broadcast a performer\u0027s entire act without his consent,\" wrote Justice White. Justice Louis F. Powell, Jr., joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall, dissented, arguing that the recording was genuinely treated as news and as such Scripps-Howard was constitutionally privileged. Justice John Paul Stevens also dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21880,"name":"Ezra K.

The indictment alleged that Lovasco committed the offenses between July 25 and August 31, 1973—more than 18 months before the prosecutors filed the indictment. Lovasco moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the delay was unnecessary and prejudicial to his defense, as two of his witnesses had died in the interim. The district court found that the government had collected all of the necessary information to indict Lovasco within a month of the alleged commission of crimes and granted the motion to dismiss. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eBy indicting Lovasco for crimes he allegedly committed 18 months prior, did the government violate either: (1) the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial or (2) his due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. No. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion for the 8-1 majority. The Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial applies only after a person has been accused of a crime and that the pre-indictment delay did not deprive Lovasco of due process, though the lapse of time somewhat prejudiced his defense. The Court held that the deaths of the witnesses did not outweigh the government’s interest in fully investigating crimes before bringing charges against the accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Court should have accepted the lower court’s finding that the delay was unnecessary and unreasonable rather than accept as fact the government’s unsworn statements that the delay was due to good-faith investigative efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32657,"name":"John P.

The tax was applied equally to businesses involved in intra-and interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Mississippi tax violate the Commerce Clause because it placed a burden on an activity associated with interstate commerce?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA unanimous Court found the tax valid. Businesses involved in interstate commerce should assume a just share of the state tax burden. The Court\u0027s decision established four criteria to be met for a state tax to be valid and not an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. The tax must be (1) on an activity connected to the state, (2) fairly apportioned to be based on intrastate commerce, (3) nondiscriminatory, and (4) related to state services provided. These criteria are only valid if Congress has not imposed conflicting regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16715,"name":"Alan W.

Included within this population were thousands who survived detention in Nazi concentration camps. On March 20, 1977, Frank Collin, the leader of the National Socialist (\"Nazi\") Party of America, informed Skokie\u0027s police chief that the National Socialists intended to march on the village\u0027s sidewalk on May 1. As a result of media attention and a number of phone calls allegedly made by Nazi Party members to residents with \"Jewish names\", this planned demonstration became common knowledge among Skokie\u0027s Jewish community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollin wrote a letter to Skokie officials stating that the purpose of the demonstration was to protest the Skokie Park District\u0027s ordinance requiring a bond of $350,000 to be posted prior to the issuance of a park permit. He also stated that the demonstration would consist of 30-50 demonstrators marching in single file in front of the Skokie Village Hall. The demonstrators intended to wear uniforms similar to those traditionally worn by Nazis, including swastika armbands. Collin also said that the demonstrators would not make derogatory public statements and would cooperate with reasonable police instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court of Cook County conducted a hearing on a motion by the Village of Skokie for a preliminary injunction. The court considered Collin\u0027s letter as an affidavit and took the testimony of a number of Skokie residents. One resident testified that a number of Jewish organizations planned a counterdemonstration for the same day with an expected attendance of 12,000 to 15,000 persons, and that the appearance of Nazi demonstrators could well lead to violence. The mayor of Skokie also testified that the demonstration could lead to uncontrollable violence. The court entered an order enjoining defendants from marching, walking, or parading or otherwise displaying the swastika on or off their person on May 1, 1977. The Nazi Party applied to the Illinois appellate court for a stay of the district court\u0027s injunction; the appellate court denied their application. On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court also denied the petition for a stay. The Nazi Party then filed an application for a stay with Justice John Paul Stevens, who referred the matter to the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Illinois Supreme Court improperly deny the National Socialist Party\u0027s request for a stay of the district court\u0027s injunction?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam opinion, the Court held that Illinois must provide strict procedural safeguards, including appellate review, to deny a stay for an injunction depriving the Nazi Party of protected First Amendment rights. The Court treated the Illinois Supreme Court\u0027s denial of a stay as a final judgment for the purposes of Supreme Court jurisdiction because it involved a right separable from and collateral to the merits of the Nazi Party\u0027s case. Hence, the Court also treated the Nazi Party\u0027s application for a stay as a petition for certiorari. The Court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Potter Stewart, dissented. He disagreed that the refusal of the Illinois Supreme Court to stay an injunction could be described as a final judgment or decree by the highest court of a state. He noted that no Illinois appellate court had heard or decided the merits of the Nazi Party\u0027s federal claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"432","page":"43","year":"1977","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/15544"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15043,"name":"Potter Stewart","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/potter_stewart","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stewart","roles":[{"id":2687,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-353962800,"date_end":362984400,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

In exercising that power, the Administrator of the EPA created groups made up of similar plants and prescribed a specific pollution limitation to each of the different groups. These regulations granted existing plants some leeway for complying with the prescribed pollution limit. Petitioners, eight inorganic chemical manufacturing plants, sued the EPA in district court and alleged that it had overstepped its statutory authority by promulgating regulations organized by categories, instead of issuing specific pollution limits for each plant. Petitioners also argued that the EPA regulations for plants that had not yet been built violated the provisions of the Act because they did not allow for any variance from the prescribed limit. The district court found that the Act gave appellate courts jurisdiction to review pollution regulations and removed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The appellate court rejected petitioners’ arguments regarding the categorical limits but held that the EPA must provide new plants the same variance allowances with which the existing plants were provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Can the EPA issue industry-wide regulations that categorically limit the amount of pollutants that existing manufacturing plants can discharge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to review the EPA regulations that apply to existing plants?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(3) Can the EPA subject newly constructed manufacturing plants to exacting pollution standards that do not allow for any variance from the prescribed limit?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, yes. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority. The Court held that the language of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act unambiguously allowed the EPA to enact regulations creating categorical limits on pollution, while allowing existing plants to vary slightly from the prescribed limit. The Court rejected the petitioners’ argument that the EPA must create a limit for each individual plant via a permit system because such a system would impose a heavy burden on the EPA to be intimately familiar with the circumstances of more than 42,000 manufacturing plants. Furthermore, the Court held that the appellate court had jurisdiction to review the pollution restrictions as a whole and was not limited to reviewing only the individual variance allowed for each plant. Although the restrictions for existing plants allowed for variance from the prescribed pollution limit, the Court held that the language of the Act showed a clear congressional intention to charge the EPA with setting absolute prohibitions on pollution. Therefore, the EPA could set exacting pollution standards for newly constructed plants that did not allow for any variance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F.

Drew Junior High School. A teacher had accused Andrews of tardiness, but Andrews claimed he still had two minutes to get to class when he was seized. When Andrews resisted paddling, Barnes struck him on the arm, back, and across the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn October 6, 1970, Principal Willie J. Wright removed James Ingraham and several other disruptive students to his office, where he paddled eight to ten of them. When Ingraham refused to assume a paddling position, Wright called on Barnes and Assistant Principal Lemmie Deliford to hold Ingraham in a prone position while Wright administered twenty blows. Ingraham’s mother later took him to a hospital for treatment, where he was prescribed cold compresses, laxatives and pain-killing pills for a hematoma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngraham and Andrews filed a complaint against Wright, Deliford, Barnes and Edwart L. Whigham, the superintendant of the Dade County School System; the complaint alleged the deprivation of constitutional rights and damages from the administration of corporal punishment. They also filed a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of all students in the Dade County schools. At the close of Ingraham and Andrews’ case, the defendants successfully moved to dismiss the third count because the plaintiffs showed no right to relief. The court also ruled that the evidence for the first two counts was insufficient to go to a jury. The United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, reversed. The Fifth Circuit held that the punishment of Ingraham and Andrews was so severe that it violated the Eighth and Fourteenth amendments and that the school’s corporal punishment policy failed to satisfy due process. Upon rehearing, the en banc court rejected this conclusion and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. It held that due process did not require that students receive notice or an opportunity to be heard and that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not forbid corporal punishment in schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment forbid corporal punishment inflicted by teachers and administrators upon Ingraham and Andrews at Charles R. Drew Junior High School? Does Dade County School System’s corporal punishment policy violate due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Lewis Powell, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment does not prevent corporal punishment in public schools. While acknowledging the general abandonment of corporal punishment as a means of punishing criminals, Justice Powell looked to the common law history of similar punishment in schools and discerned no trend towards its elimination. Rather, common law suggested that teachers could legally impose reasonable, non-excessive force on their students. He also noted that the Court previously limited the application of the Eighth Amendment’s “cruel and unusual” language to criminal punishment. Justice Powell reasoned that Ingraham and Andrews had less need for similar Eighth Amendment protection because they attended an open institution subject to more public scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Powell also held that the Fourteenth Amendment’s requirement of procedural due process was satisfied by Florida law. Florida recognized students’ common law right to be free from excessive corporal punishment in school, mandating that teachers and administrators exercise prudence and restraint in administering physical punishment. Unreasonable or excessive punishment could result in criminal or civil liability for the responsible teacher or administrator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White dissented, joined by Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens.

Even though his wife Hannah had paid Social Security taxes for 25 years, his application was denied. To be eligible for benefits under 42 U.S.C. Section 402, he must have been receiving half his support from his wife at her time of death. Section 402 did not impose this requirement on widows whose husbands had recently passed away. Goldfarb challenged this statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The District Court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. The Government appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the gender-based requirements for survivor\u0027s benefits in Section 402 violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-4 decision, the Court affirmed the District Court in holding the statute unconstitutional. Writing for a four-justice plurality, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. described this situation as \"indistinguishable\" from the one in \u003cem\u003eWeinberger v. Wiesenfeld\u003c/em\u003e, where a similar statute was invalidated. In this case, a female worker\u0027s family was less protected than the family of a male worker. The court rejected the \"archaic and overbroad\" generalizations that a wife is more likely to be dependent on her husband than a husband on his wife. These \"old notions\" of gender roles were not sufficient to justify the different treatment of widows and widowers, and which was therefore in violation of the Due Process Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33866,"name":"Keith A.

The Court then rejected the argument \"that a State may attempt to influence the actions of men and women by imposing sanctions on the children born of their illegitimate relationships.\" The Court also noted that it was likely that Trimble would have inherited a substantial part of Gordon\u0027s estate had he written a will before his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33678,"name":"James D.

When MHDC applied for the necessary zoning permits, authorizing a switch from a single-to a multiple-family classification, Arlington\u0027s planning commission denied the request. Acting on behalf of itself and several minority members, MHDC challenged Arlington\u0027s denial as racially discriminatory. On appeal from an adverse district court decision, the Court of Appeals reversed and the Supreme Court granted Arlington certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Arlington Height\u0027s denial of a zoning request, necessary for the creation of low-and moderate-income housing, racially discriminatory in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003ePerhaps. After finding that MHDC had proper federal standing, since it acted on behalf of black plaintiffs who stood to suffer direct and measurable injuries from Arlington\u0027s denial, the Court held that it failed to establish Arlington\u0027s racially discriminatory intent or purpose. While indicating that Arlington\u0027s zoning denial may result in a racially disproportionate impact, the evidence did not show that this was Arlington\u0027s deliberate intention.

Also, a reapportionment plan does not violate the same Amendments by using numerical quotas to establish a certain number of black majority districts. Although New York deliberately increased nonwhite majorities in several districts, there was no \"fencing out\" of the white population in the county from electoral participation. The reapportionment did not underrepresent the whites relative to their share of the population. The Court found that New York could use apportionment plans to attempt to prevent racial minorities from being repeatedly outvoted at the expense of the white populations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26357,"name":"George D.

The statute defined material as obscene if its predominant appeal was “a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion” and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. Ward waived his right to a jury trial, and was found guilty based on the two publications and the testimony of the police officer who purchased them at the store. Ward was sentenced to one day in jail and a $200 fine. While Ward’s appeal was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court decided \u003cem\u003eMiller v. California\u003c/em\u003e, which confirmed that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment, but acknowledging that official regulation should only cover “works which depict or describe sexual conduct” and such conduct must be specifically defined in the applicable law. The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed Ward’s conviction. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that the publications were obscene and the Illinois statute was not unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Illinois obscenity statute unconstitutionally vague and/or overbroad?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 5-4 majority, affirmed. The Supreme Court held that the Illinois statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Ward because an earlier Illinois Supreme Court decision made it clear that the statute reached sadomasochistic materials. Sadomasochistic materials could be prohibited under a state obscenity statute, even though they were not in the examples of sexually explicit representations made in the \u003cem\u003eMiller\u003c/em\u003e decision, because those examples were not intended to be an exhaustive list. The Illinois statute was not overbroad because previous Illinois Supreme Court decisions provided guidelines in line with \u003cem\u003eMiller\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr dissented, arguing that the Illinois statute was overbroad and unconstitutional on its face. Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent. Justice John Paul Stevens also dissented, writing that the majority opinion abandoned the specificity prong of the \u003cem\u003eMiller\u003c/em\u003e test. Justice Brennan, Justice Stewart and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29360,"name":"J.

He told a circuit court judge that his injuries were the result of beatings from his father, that his brother and one of his sisters had been killed by his father, and that his other sister was kept locked in a closet at home. The judge issued a warrant for Dobbert’s arrest, and Dobbert fled Jacksonville. In October 1973, Dobbert was arrested in Texas and extradited to Florida for trial.  The Florida death penalty law in place when the children were killed, which gave the jury ultimate authority in deciding to impose the penalty, was found unconstitutional before Dobbert’s trial.  It was replaced by a new law where the jury gave an advisory recommendation, but the judge made the ultimate decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore his trial, Dobbert applied to the Supreme Court of Florida for a constitutional stay of trial, arguing that applying the new death penalty law violated the ex post facto and equal protection clauses of the Constitution. His application was denied. Dobbert also moved for a change of venue from Duval County based on the publicity his trial was receiving. The trial judge took the motion under advisement and later denied it. Dobbert was convicted of the first-degree murder of his daughter, second-degree murder of his son, and the torture and abuse of his two other children. At his sentencing hearing, the jury recommended life imprisonment, but the trial judge, acting under the authority granted to him by the Florida statute governing the death penalty, overruled the jury and sentenced Dobbert to death. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the changes to the Florida death penalty statutes submit Dobbert to a trial by ex post facto laws or deny him his rights to equal protection and a fair trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that, despite the fact that the Florida laws governing the death penalty changed during the time period the crimes in question were committed, the changes were procedural and better for the sentencing system. The Court also held that Florida’s previous death penalty statutes, although found unconstitutional before Dobbert’s trial, served as a warning to Dobbert’s that Florida could impose the death penalty. Additionally, Dobbert failed to provide evidence that his trial was affected by the trial judge’s dismissal of his motion for a change in venue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a concurring opinion and argued that the changes in the Florida death penalty statutes altered the system in favor of defendants, and therefore Dobbert’s constitutional rights were not violated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment that violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment in all circumstances. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent. In a separate dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that, since the previous Florida death penalty statutes were found to be constitutionally invalid, they cannot be considered a fair warning. He also argued that Dobbert would not have faced the death penalty if tried slightly earlier, and it showed “capricious action” on the part of the government to subject him to the death penalty. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19566,"name":"Charles W.

W. Gamble was a prisoner in the Huntington Unit of the Texas prison system, also known as the “Walls Unit.” On November 9, 1973, a 600-pound bale of cotton fell on Gamble while he was working in a textile mill during a work assignment in Huntsville, Texas. He continued to work for several hours, but later became stiff and requested a pass to the unit hospital. The hospital gave Gamble a checkup for a hernia and sent him back to his cell, but later his pain became so intense that he was forced to return to the hospital. A nurse gave Gamble two pain pills, and a hospital doctor later examined him but gave him no further treatment. On November 10th, a different doctor examined Gamble, prescribed him painkillers and placed Gamble on a cell-pass cell-feed routine that mostly confined him to his cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat same doctor later took Gamble off the cell-pass cell-feed routine, concluding that he was able to engage in light work. The prison administrative office soon placed Gamble in “administrative segregation” -- essentially solitary confinement -- for refusing to work. Gamble remained in solitary confinement through January of the next year, although he complained that his back pain was as intense as on the first day he was injured. On December 6, a different doctor examined Gamble and diagnosed him with high blood pressure; the previous doctor never detected this condition. Gamble refused to work several more times over the next few months, and was repeatedly disciplined for doing so. When Gamble began experiencing pain in his chest on a regular basis, he was hospitalized and treated, but the prison denied him later requests for treatment. In all, medical personnel treated Gamble seventeen times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 11, 1974, Gamble signed a \u003ci\u003epro se\u003c/i\u003e complaint alleging that the prison subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth. The district court dismissed Gamble’s complaint for failure to state a claim. The United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, reversed, noting that the prison failed to diagnose Gamble’s back injury by giving him an X-ray, that the prison provided no real treatment for Gamble’s back injury, and that Gamble was essentially placed in solitary confinement due to substandard medical care.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did Gamble’s \u003ci\u003epro se\u003c/i\u003e complaint that the Walls unit subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment raise a constitutional question or state a claim upon which relief can be granted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the Fifth Circuit err in reversing the district court’s summary dismissal of Gamble’s complaint because the complaint rested on a disagreement between licensed physicians about Gamble’s injury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and yes. In an 8-1 decision written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court held that the prison’s treatment of Gamble did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Justice Marshall acknowledged that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments required the Texas government to provide medical care for prisoners; he also determined, however, that a negligent or inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care did not constitute medical mistreatment under the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Marshall then considered whether Gamble’s complaint stated a claim, construing the pleadings of his inartfully written \u003ci\u003epro se\u003c/i\u003e complaint liberally. He focused on the fact that medical personnel treated Gamble on seventeen occasions in a three-month period. Justice Marshall argued that the form of medical treatment was a classic example of a matter for medical judgment; as a consequence, the doctor’s decision not to order an X-ray or provide additional medication did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment. Thus, the Fifth Circuit erred in reversing the district court’s dismissal of Gamble’s claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry Blackmun concurred in the Court’s judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens dissented. He argued that Court should have asked whether it could say with assurance and beyond any doubt that no set of facts could be proved that would entitle Gamble to relief. He questioned the Court’s decision to grant certiorari, noting that any constitutional questions presented by Gamble’s case were already resolved by other circuit courts. Finally, Justice Stevens argued that the majority improperly considered the defendants’ subjective motivations in determining whether or not their actions were crude or unusual.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17946,"name":"Bert W.

The officer saw the vendor up close for several minutes.  The officer described the vendor to another officer who obtained a photograph of Nowell A. Brathwaite and gave it to the first officer.  The officer identified the Brathwaite as the narcotics vendor.  At trial, the photograph was admitted as evidence and the officer again identified Brathwaite as the vendor.  A jury convicted Brathwaite of possession and sale of heroin.  The Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed.  Brathwaite then filed a petition for a writ of habeus corpus in district court.  The district court dismissed the petition, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that the officer’s identification was unreliable and the method of identification from a single photograph was unnecessarily suggestive.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the court of appeals err in allowing the police officer to identify Brathwaite from a single photograph?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for a 7-2 majority, reversed the court of appeals.  The Supreme Court held that a suggestive identification procedure does not automatically require excluding the evidence if the identification is reliable, considering the totality of the circumstances.  With the circumstances in this case, the identification was reliable.  Justice John Paul Stevens concurred, writing that rules to protect against convictions based on unreliable identifications are better developed by the legislative process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented, arguing for a per se exclusionary rule for unnecessarily suggestive identification procedures.

Healthy City School District Board of Education from 1966 until 1971. In 1969, he was elected president of the Teachers’ Association during a period of tension between the board and the Teacher’s Association. Doyle was also involved with a series of incidents beginning in 1970 where he allegedly behaved inappropriately toward students and other staff members; in one incident, Doyle made obscene gestures to two students. Finally, in February 1971, Doyle conveyed the substance of an internal memorandum regarding a proposed staff dress code to a disc jockey at WSAI, a Cincinnati radio station. The disc jockey promptly announced the dress code as a news item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne month later, the superintendent of the school district recommended that the board not renew Doyle’s contract, along with the contracts of nine other teachers.  The board adopted the superintendent’s recommendations. In response to Doyle’s request for an explanation, the board stated that Doyle displayed a “lack of tact in handling professional matters,” and cited both the call to the disc jockey and the obscene gestures Doyle made toward students. Doyle brought a § 1331 federal question action against the board for reinstatement with damages, claiming that the board’s refusal to rehire him violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the district court found that all of the incidents occurred, it held that Doyle was still entitled to reinstatement with backpay. The court concluded that Doyle’s call to the radio station was protected by the First Amendment and that the call played a substantial part in the board’s decision not to rehire Doyle, a violation of Doyle’s rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment. The United States Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit affirmed in a short per curiam opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Was Mt. Healthy City School District Board protected by the sovereign immunity clause of the Eleventh Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Was Mt. Healthy City School District Board forbidden by the First Amendment from considering Doyle’s phone call to a radio station in its decision not to renew Doyle’s contract?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Rehnquist held that the school district was not entitled to sovereign immunity, which generally extended to the states themselves and to state officials in their official capacities. He reasoned that the board was more akin to a municipal corporation, given its independent power to issue bonds and levy taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile acknowledging that Doyle’s claims were not defeated by the fact that he lacked tenure and that his call to the station was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court rejected the district court’s conclusion that the board’s consideration of the call in itself violated Doyle’s rights. He questioned the “substantial part” rule used by the district court, expressing concern that it might prevent employers from properly and thoroughly assessing employees’ performance when employers are aware of protected conduct. Instead, Justice Rehnquist held that the district court should have also determined whether the board showed by a preponderance of evidence that it would have reached the same decision if it had not considered Doyle’s phone call to the radio station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, although the school district argued that it was not a “person” for purposes of a § 1983 claim, Justice Rehnquist declined to answer whether Doyle’s § 1331 federal question claim was limited by the terms of § 1983. He noted that Doyle demonstrated a proper federal question and claimed more than $10,000 in damages, given the potential value of his reinstatement. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38208,"name":"Philip S.
