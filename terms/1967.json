Under the Act, it was illegal for a member of the Party to remain employed at a location that the Secretary of Defense names as a “defense facility”.  The district court dismissed the indictment because it did not allege that Robel was an active member of the Communist Party.  The district court felt that this provision of the Act violated the First Amendment right to association if it applied to inactive Party members.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certified the case for direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Act’s bar on Communist Party member employment in a “defense facility” violate the First Amendment right of association?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 6-2 decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the majority holding that the “defense facility” employment provision was an unconstitutional abridgment of the right of association even if it applied only to active Party members.  The Supreme Court held that the provision was overbroad and the war power does not give Congress a blank slate to do whatever it wants. Justice William J. Brennan concurred in the judgment, writing that Congress’ delegation of authority in designating defense facilities to the Secretary of Defense was unconstitutional because they provided no meaningful standards for the Secretary to follow. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, stating that the Communist Party’s goal of government overthrow justified the ban on employment in defense facilities.  Justice John M. Harlan joined in the dissent.  Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33912,"name":"Kevin T.

An Illinois statute provides grounds for the dismissal of any juror with \"conscientious scruples\" against capital punishment. At Witherspoon\u0027s trial, the prosecution eliminated nearly half of the prospective jurors with qualms about capital punishment. The prosecution did not find out if most of the jurors dismissed would necessarily vote against capital punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWitherspoon appealed, alleging that the dismissal of prospective jurors with qualms about capital punishment violated his Sixth Amendment right to an \"impartial jury\" and 14th Amendment right to due process. On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court found that no constitutional violation took place.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a state statue that provides grounds for the dismissal of any juror with \"conscientious scruples\" against capital punishment violate the Sixth Amendment\u0027s guarantee of an \"impartial jury\" and the 14th Amendment\u0027s guarantee of due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an opinion delivered by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court held 6-3 that Witherspoon\u0027s death sentence was unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that a jury composed after the dismissal of all who oppose the death sentence was biased in favor the death sentence; such a jury was not impartial and thus violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court held that while jurors who say they will not impose the death sentence can be dismissed, jurors who simply oppose the death sentence as a personal belief may not. Justice William Douglas, concurring, argued that it also unconstitutional to dismiss prospective jurors who say they will never impose the death sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo Black, with whom Justices John Harlan and Byron White joined, dissented. Douglas argued that the Constitution allows the dismissal of all jurors who oppose the death penalty personally, because they will be necessarily biased against the death penalty. In a separate dissent, White argued that the Illinois legislature was allowed to exclude \"those with doubts\" about \"one of the punishments among which the legislature sought to have them choose....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15319,"title":"Oral Argument - April 24, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15319"}],"citation":{"volume":"391","page":"510","year":"1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26161"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

During the investigation, police officials searched the home of Mrs. Hattie Leath, Bumper’s grandmother, with whom he was living at the time. Leath consented to a search of her home, but only after the police officials informed her they had a warrant, which they did not actually have. The officers found a rifle that was later introduced into evidence at Bumper’s trial. The trial court allowed the rifle to be entered into evidence because it held that Leath had consented to the search. The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a search considered lawful under the Fourth Amendment on the basis of consent when the consent was given only after the police official claimed he had a warrant for said search?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion for the 7-2 majority. The Court held that, for a search to be lawful under the Fourth Amendment, the consent must have been freely and voluntarily given. A search that relies on a warrant cannot be justified on the basis of consent if the warrant turns out to be faulty, regardless of the police officer’s knowledge of the faultiness of the warrant. Therefore, the evidence obtained during the search in this case should not have been admitted into evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice John M. Harlan wrote that, because the introduction of the rifle into evidence was not harmless error in the sense that Bumper’s guilt was not adjudicated based solely on constitutionally admissible evidence, not in the sense that he was improperly convicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent in which he highlighted the fact that Leath testified that her consent “was all [her] own free will.” The fact that the police did not have a warrant does not negate the fact that Mrs. Leath wanted the police to search her premises to show her innocence; therefore, her consent was freely and voluntarily given. Justice Black also argued that, while all evidence found in the illegal search must be thrown out, Bumper should still have been found guilty without a mandatory retrial. In his separate dissent, Justice White dissented and argued that not every search conditionally consented to must be deemed invalid. The fact that the evidence was discovered illegally and without a warrant does not mean that the evidence should not be deemed legal if a valid warrant is eventually presented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37286,"name":"Norman B.

Two New Orleans Police Department officers stopped him because, in their opinion, he fitted the description of a man suspected of murder. Wainwright told the officers he had identification at home, but not on his person. The officers then asked Wainwright to remove this jacket so that they could search him for a tattoo that the suspected murdered had on his left arm. Wainwright ultimately refused to do so after trying to walk away and some mild verbal sparing. The officers then arrested him on a charge of vagrancy by loitering and frisked him.

Mempa pled guilty to the burglary charge, and the court revoked Mempa’s probation and sentenced him to ten years in prison. Mempa petitioned the Washington Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus and claimed that he was denied his right to counsel during the proceedings revoking his probation. The Washington Supreme Court denied his petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the absence of counsel during a post-trial proceeding for revocation of probation or imposition of deferred sentencing violate the Sixth Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion for the unanimous Court. The Court held that the legal right to counsel that the Sixth Amendment guarantees, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, extends to the post-trial proceeding for revocation of probation and deferred sentencing. The right of counsel at this stage ensures that the conviction and sentence are read correctly without misinterpretation of record. Counsel also assists the defendant in asserting his rights, such as the right to appeal, at the deferred sentencing stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23227,"name":"Evan L.

Gambling and accepting wagers was illegal in Connecticut. Marchetti unsuccessfully attempted to arrest the judgment.  He argued that the requirements to register and pay the tax violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the federal wagering tax statutes violate the privilege against self-incrimination?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 7-1 decision, Justice John M. Harlan wrote for the majority reversing the lower court opinion.  The Supreme Court held that the registration and occupational tax provisions were constitutional, but using the related information to prosecute someone did violate privilege.  Marchetti’s claim of privilege was a proper defense and should have been sufficient to avoid conviction.  Justice Earl Warren wrote a dissent stating that this decision frustrates the purpose of the tax and opens the door to many other similar challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33738,"name":"Jacob D.

Waldron sought treble damages alleging a conspiracy by the oil companies to boycott Iranian oil.  The trial judge limited Waldron’s discovery to depositions of certain Cities employees.  After an extended period of depositions, the trial judge granted Cities summary judgment because there was no material evidence that Cities took any part in the conspiracy.  The court denied Waldron’s motion of additional discovery because the court felt it would be a fishing expedition and constitute harassment.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in limiting Waldron’s discovery?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e (2) Was summary judgment properly awarded?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Yes.  In a 5-3 decision, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote for the opinion affirming the lower court decision.  The Supreme Court held that Waldron failed to show that the additional discovery would have been fruitful, so he was not prejudiced by the limitations.  Also, on the facts shown, summary judgment was proper.  Waldron failed to produce any facts that raised a genuine issue for trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45177,"name":"William E.

Watts, a schoolteacher in Alaska, held private conversations with other teachers to obtain their support to remove the superintendent from his position. His further language included words to the effect of ‘we are unable to get rid of the superintendent, so let’s get rid of the school board.’ The Seward School Board considered Watts\u0027 conduct to be “immoral,” defined as “conduct of the person tending to bring the individual concerned or the teaching profession into public disgrace or disrespect” under the relevant Alaska statute, so Watts was dismissed from his teaching job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatts\u0027 dismissal was upheld in both the Alaska Superior Court and the Alaska Supreme Court. The Alaska Supreme Court held that Watts\u0027 conduct “had a tendency to bring the teaching profession into public disgrace or disrespect.” Watts then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and argued that his dismissal violated his First Amendment right because the school board was attempting to limit his freedom of political speech. He also argued a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right because he should have the same equal protection for expression as any other private individual. After Watts filed his petition, Alaska amended the relevant state statute to reflect the rights of teachers to comment and criticize school administrators just as any private individual would have the right to do. Under the amended statute, Watts would not have been dismissed from his job.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould this case be vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of a change to the Alaska statute used in this case?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam decision, the eight-justice majority held that the change in Alaska’s statute was directly relevant to this case. Therefore, it was necessary that the case be reversed and remanded to the Supreme Court of Alaska for further consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Justice William O. Douglas and Justice Hugo L. Black concurred with the reverse and remand decision in this case, they said they would have reversed the decision outright for reasons Justice Douglas stated in his concurring opinion in \u003cem\u003ePickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District\u003c/em\u003e. In that case, a teacher was dismissed from his job for sending a letter to a local newspaper criticizing financial decisions of the board and the superintendent of his school. In his opinion, Justice Douglas highlighted that it is not reason enough to limit free speech because words are “malicious” or have a “reckless disregard for the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice White dissented without writing a separate opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25585,"name":"George Kaufmann","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/george_kaufmann","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kaufmann","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"george_kaufmann"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21447"},{"advocate":{"ID":25505,"name":"George N.

Based on recordings of his end of the conversations, Katz was convicted under an eight-count indictment for the illegal transmission of wagering information from Los Angeles to Boston and Miami. On appeal, Katz challenged his conviction arguing that the recordings could not be used as evidence against him. The Court of Appeals rejected this point, noting the absence of a physical intrusion into the phone booth itself.

Kentucky Utilities Company (KU) held a non-exclusive county franchise to occupy county roads. In 1954, Dixie Power and Light transferred its assets to KU and dissolved, giving KU control over the vast majority of the market in Tazewell and New Tazewell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended in 1959, barred the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from expanding its sales outside the area for which the TVA or its distributors were the primary source of power supply on July 1, 1957. On that date, the area of Claiborne County had 3,564 users of TVA power compared to 1,839 users of KU power; the towns of Tazewell and New Tazewell, however, had 28 TVA users and 561 KU users. KU’s retail rates for electricity in the towns were approximately two-and-one-half times higher than those offered by TVA. Citizens in Tazewell and New Tazewell responded to this rate disparity by demanding access to the TVA’s cheaper power. After three years of complaints, planning and consultations, the towns’ governments contracted to hook up a new municipal system to TVA’s power grid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKU filed suit against TVA, the mayors of Tazewell and New Tazewell, and the Powell Valley Electric Cooperative, a TVA distributor. KU charged the defendants with conspiracy to destroy its business in Tazewell and asked the court to enjoin TVA from supplying power to the new municipal system. Shortly before trial, the TVA Board of Directors determined that TVA was the primary source of power for Claiborne County on July 1, 1957, and that Claiborne County was the relevant area for the purposes of the act. The district court upheld the board’s decision, but the Sixth Circuit United States Court of Appeals reversed. Comparing the number of customers served by KU and TVA in Tazewell and New Tazewell, the Sixth Circuit held that the two towns and KU’s original county road corridor were an ‘area’ for the purposes of the act and that TVA was barred from extending its service to that area.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did Kentucky Utilities Company, a private utility, have standing to maintain an action to enjoin the Tennessee Valley Authority from supplying power to customers and areas served by that utility under the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1959?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Did the Sixth Circuit United States Court of Appeals exceed its authority by rejecting the TVA Board of Directors’ interpretation of the TVA Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. In a 6-1 decision written by Justice Hugo Black, the Court held that Kentucky Utilities Company had standing to sue because one legislative purpose of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act was to protect private power suppliers’ competitive interests. He noted that the petitioners conceded this point, and that congress was only able to secure funding for the TVA by agreeing to limit its territorial expansion, thereby also limiting unfair competition with private suppliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Black further held that the courts should only set aside the TVA’s area determinations if those determinations lacked reasonable support in relation to the statutory purpose of controlling the TVA’s territorial expansion. Hence, the Court held that the Sixth Circuit should have upheld the TVA Board’s determination that Claiborne County was the relevant area under the act. Justice Black rejected KU’s argument that the act prohibited the TVA from extending its services to privately-served customers, noting that the act did not make the existence of a private supplier in an area an automatic bar to TVA expansion in that area. He also emphasized that Tazewell and New Tazewell were practically surrounded by areas already served by the TVA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Justice Black rejected KU’s argument that the act prohibited the TVA from providing service to the area in question because KU was the primary supplier on July 1, 1957. Justice Black noted that the act only made the existence of a private supplier an absolute bar to TVA activity if the TVA’s activities extended up to five miles beyond the area it originally served. Given the TVA Board’s ruling that Tazewell and New Tazewell fell within TVA’s primary service area, this restriction did not apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan dissented. He argued that Congress intended the TVA to limit the TVA Board’s discretion as to the expansion of its area of service. He noted that neither the statute nor the legislative history provided a formula for the precise measurement of the TVA’s service area, and that the Sixth Circuit’s emphasis on the number of customers served by TVA and KU in the villages on July 1, 1957 was a sensible and practical standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices William O. Douglas and Thurgood Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of the case\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39852,"name":"Robert H.

He was tried, convicted, and fined $20 in the Corporation Court of Austin Texas.  On appeal, Powell argued that criminal punishment for public intoxication is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, because he had chronic alcoholism.  Under this theory, he appeared in public drunk as a compulsive symptom of the disease, not his own choice.  The County court of Travis County held that alcoholism is not a defense to the charge and affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the conviction of a chronic alcoholic for public intoxication cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for a four justice plurality, affirmed the lower court.  The plurality found that the record did not prove that alcoholics were totally unable to control their alcohol consumption.  The law prohibiting public intoxication did not punish Powell for his alcoholism, but for his being drunk in a public location.  Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Hugo L. Black, and Justice John M. Harlan joined in the plurality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black concurred, writing that the Eighth Amendment does not require states to decide what part of a defendant’s personality is responsible for their actions.  Justice John M. Harlan joined in this concurrence.  Justice Byron R. White concurred in the judgment, writing that he would not punish a chronic alcoholic just for being drunk, but supports the punishment for being drunk in public.  The record did not support the argument that Powell had no control over being in public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abe Fortas dissented, writing that criminal penalties are not proper for people with conditions that they have no power to change.

Between 1959 and 1961, the Internal Revenue Service audited six couples represented by Umans. According to Louis R. Deitsch, an IRS employee, Umans approached Deitsch before each audit to “work something out together on it”. They agreed upon a disallowance for each audit and Umans gave Deitsch an envelope containing $50 for each case. Five other IRS employees described similar transactions between the years 1961 and 1963, wherein smaller disallowances were given during audits followed by cash payments to the auditing IRS employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUmans and the six IRS employees, including Deitsch, were indicted in August 1964. Umans was charged with aiding and abetting IRS employees in receiving illegal fees.  He was also charged with giving money to government officials. On March 25, 1965, Umans and the six IRS employees were re-indicted.  The grand jury additionally charged Umans with giving money to government officials with the intent to influence their actions. The evidence before the grand jury consisted solely of an IRS agent summarizing statements made by witnesses who would later testify at Umans’ trial. At trial, Umans requested access to statements made by the IRS employees that they took bribes from persons other than Umans; the court denied this request and sealed the documents in question. The government’s case was based almost entirely on the testimonies of three of the IRS employees, including that of Deitsch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Sterry R. Waterman, writing for a unanimous United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, held that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the intent element of Umans’ charge for aiding and abetting IRS employees, but that this instruction was not in plain error. He held that the instruction was not sufficiently prejudicial, noting that it was not objected to at trial. Judge Waterman did, however, reverse the sentence for giving money to officials, holding that this sentence could not be concurrent with the sentence for giving money to officials with intent to influence their actions. He noted that the charges were identical but for the higher requirement of proof in the latter charge. Looking to the statute itself, Judge Waterman determined that Congress intended to make the charge for giving money to officials a lesser, included offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Waterman held that the trial court properly excluded the IRS employees’ statements about taking bribes from other persons from the record. He reasoned that it would have been within the court’s discretion to prevent Umans from cross-examining the IRS employees on this subject for impeachment purposes, as the government did not broach the subject during the employees’ direct examination. Judge Waterman also held that the government properly indicted Umans with hearsay evidence, holding that this evidence was competent. He dismissed Umans’ concerns about inconsistencies between the evidence presented to the grand jury and evidence presented at trial. He noted that Umans had access to affadavits used by the government to indict him; thus, he could have objected to any inconsistencies at trial, but did not do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid the trial court’s instruction on aiding and abetting government workers in receiving illegal fees constitute a plain error?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWas Umans’ conviction for illegally paying officials included in his conviction for unlawfully influencing officials?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWas the trial court within its discretion to withhold statements from the IRS employees wherein they admitted receiving bribes from other persons?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWas Umans improperly indicted on hearsay evidence?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a \u003ci\u003eper curiam\u003c/i\u003e opinion, the Court dismissed the United States’ writ of certiorari as improvidently granted without further comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan would have granted certiorari to affirm the court of appeals\u0027 judgment for the reasons given by Judge Waterman in his opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn December 18, 1967, the Court denied Umans petition for a rehearing, with Justice Marshall again taking no part in the consideration or decision of the petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21891,"name":"Edward Brodsky","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/edward_brodsky","view_count":0,"last_name":"Brodsky","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"edward_brodsky"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22090"},{"advocate":{"ID":41398,"name":"Sidney M.

They had a lunch counter that sold magazines, including some so-called “girlie” magazines. On October 18, 1965, a sixteen-year-old boy entered the store and purchased copies of “Sir” and “Mr. Annual”; the purchase was instigated by the boy’s parents to lay the grounds for Ginsberg’s prosecution. On October 26, 1965, Ginsberg sold the same minor copies of “Man to Man” and “Escapade” at the instigation of a police officer. All of the magazines in question contained pictures of nudes, and “Escapade” and “Mr. Annual” contained verbal descriptions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement and sexual conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSection 484-h of New York’s Penal Law prohibited the sale to persons under seventeen years of age of 1) pictures of nudity or sexual conduct or 2) literature containing narrative accounts or sexual excitement, if these materials were “harmful to minors.” It defined “harmful to minors” as that quality of any description or representation of nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse that 1) predominantly appealed to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors, 2) was patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what was suitable material for minors, and 3) was utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinsberg was tried before a judge without a jury in Nassau County District Court and was found guilty on two counts of violating Section 484-h. The Appellate Term, Second Department of the New York Supreme Court affirmed his conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did Section 484-h of New York’s Penal Law violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments on its face because it restrained expression?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Was Section 484-h of the Penal Law unconstitutionally vague and uncertain on its face, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a 6-3 decision written by Justice William Brennan, the Court held that Section 484-h did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments as a restriction on expression. Justice Brennan wrote that obscenity was not within the area of protected speech or press. He acknowledged that the magazines were not obscene for adults, but emphasized that Section 484-h did not prohibit Ginsberg from selling the magazines in question to persons seventeen years of age or older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Brennan focused on Ginsberg’s argument that the scope of the constitutional freedom to read material concerned with sex did not depend upon whether that person was an adult or a minor. He rejected Ginsberg’s contention that Section 484-h was a violation of minors’ constitutionally protected freedoms, characterizing Section 484-h as New York’s attempt to adjust the assessment of obscenity in terms of the sexual interests of minors. Justice Brennan wrote that New York had an interest in the well-being of its children, and that this subject was within New York’s constitutional power of regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Brennan also held that Section 484-h was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. He rejected Ginsberg’s argument that Section 484-h failed to give adequate notice of what was prohibited. The New York Court of Appeals previously read Section 484-h to prohibit knowingly selling obscene material to minors, and the Court also read a knowledge requirement into other similar state statutes. Justice Brennan also rejected Ginsberg’s argument that the statute was impermissibly vague, as Section 484-h expressly stated that a defendant must be acquitted if he proved that he made a reasonable bona fide attempt to ascertain the true age of the minor in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart concurred. He argued that while the First Amendment protected men’s freedom to decide what they will read and listen to, government regulation could extend to settings where a person lacked the capacity to make a choice. New York was free to determine that children were not possessed of a full capacity for individual choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas dissented, joined by Justice Hugo Black. He acknowledged that the act was not a violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, but disagreed that obscene material was excluded from First Amendment protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abraham Fortas dissented, arguing that the majority avoided the essence of the case’s problem by failing to define obscenity for the purposes of the censorship of material sold to minors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23029,"name":"Emanuel Redfield","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/emanuel_redfield","view_count":0,"last_name":"Redfield","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"emanuel_redfield"},"advocate_description":"for appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21876"},{"advocate":{"ID":44256,"name":"William Cahn","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_cahn","view_count":0,"last_name":"Cahn","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"william_cahn"},"advocate_description":"for appellee","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21877"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15400,"title":"Oral Argument - January 16, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15400"}],"citation":{"volume":"390","page":"629","year":"1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26265"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15099,"name":"Earl Warren","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/earl_warren","view_count":0,"last_name":"Warren","roles":[{"id":2743,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-512503200,"date_end":-16570800,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

The letter complained about the board’s handling of past proposals and allocation of funds favoring athletics over academics.  The school board felt the letter was “detrimental to the efficient operation and administration of the schools” and opted to terminate Pickering’s employment.  Pickering sued in the Circuit Court of Will County alleging his letter was speech protected under the First Amendment.  The court ruled in favor of the school board and the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Pickering’s letter constitutionally-protected free speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the 8-1 majority opinion holding that Pickering’s dismissal violated his First Amendment right to free speech.  The Supreme Court noted that similar speech is not protected if it contains false statements knowingly or recklessly made.  There was no evidence that Pickering’s statements were knowingly false or reckless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas concurred, but took an even broader view of protected free speech.  Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the concurrence.  Justice Byron R. White wrote a dissent, agreeing that the letter may be protected speech, but preferring to remand the case for further proceedings to decide whether the statements in the letter were knowingly or recklessly false.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31503,"name":"John Ligtenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/john_ligtenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Ligtenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"john_ligtenberg"},"advocate_description":"for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22088"},{"advocate":{"ID":29683,"name":"John F.

During this speech, St. Amant accused his political opponent of being a Communist and of being involved in criminal activities with the head of the local Teamsters Union.  Finally, St. Amant implicated Herman Thompson, an East Baton Rouge deputy sheriff, in a scheme to move money between the Teamsters Union and St. Amant’s political opponent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson successfully sued St. Amant for defamation.  Louisiana’s First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Thompson did not show St. Amant acted with “malice.”  Thompson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  That court held that, although public figures forfeit some of their First Amendment protection from defamation, St. Amant accused Thompson of a crime with utter disregard of whether the remarks were true.  Finally, that court held that the First Amendment protects uninhibited, robust debate, rather than an open season to shoot down the good name of anyone who happens to be a public servant. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Louisiana Supreme Court correctly apply the \u003ci\u003eNew York Times v.

That test required public officials bringing a defamation lawsuit to show that the statement in question was made with “malice” -- that is, with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard for whether it was false or not.  Here, although the statements were false, Thompson did not present evidence that St. Amant ever entertained “serious doubts” about the truth of his statement.  Without evidence of either knowledge or such serious doubts, a public official could not succeed on a defamation claim. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black and Justice William O. Douglas each concurred by reiterating their concurring opinions in \u003ci\u003e New York Times v. Sullivan \u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003e Garrison v. Louisiana \u003c/i\u003e.  In those concurring opinions, Justices Black and Douglas argued that defamation laws threaten robust speech and debate about public officials and public issues.  Unless an individual engages in unprotected speech, such as obscenity or fighting words, neither the federal nor state governments should restrict speech. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abe Fortas dissented and argued that St. Amant acted with reckless disregard for the truth of his statements.  He wrote that the First Amendment does not create a shelter for character assassination of public officials.  Because St. Amant did not perform a good-faith check on the truth of his statement, Justice Fortas argued that the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court should be affirmed.  \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":40462,"name":"Russell J.

When Martinez said: \"You know what I am after,\" Sibron began reaching into his pocket. Simultaneously, Martinez thrust his hand into Sibron\u0027s pocket and pulled out several heroin envelopes. Following his arrest for drug trafficking, Sibron sought to suppress the heroin evidence as the product of an unconstitutional stop-and-frisk search. When the Criminal Court of New York City denied his motion, Sibron appealed but suffered adverse rulings in the New York State appellate courts. On appeal, the US Supreme Court granted certiorari and heard Sibron\u0027s case together with a related case, Peters v. New York. John Peters appealed his arrest and conviction for intent to commit burglary after a stop-and-frisk search of his person revealed burglary tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the broad search powers conferred on New York State police officers under the State\u0027s \"stop-and-frisk\" law violate the Fourth Amendment\u0027s search and seizure protections?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an 8-to-1 decision, the Court began by noting that although states may grant police officers great latitude in making arrests, all search and seizures are subject to constitutional limitations. In Sibron\u0027s case, the Court noted that officer Martinez never actually heard any of the conversations between Sibron and the narcotics addicts. As such, the inference that Sibron engaged in narcotics trafficking merely because he spoke with drug addicts did not constitute probably cause for a warrantless search. Moreover, Martinez\u0027s actions could not be justified as a self-protective search for weapons since he admitted that he had no reason to suspect Sibron of concealment. With respect to Peters, the Court upheld his conviction since it flowed from a lawful stop-and-frisk search. The arresting officer observed Peters prowling furtively in a building hallway and had to chase him down before capture. Such suspicious conduct justified the ensuing stop-and-frisk search of Peter\u0027s person that, in turn, revealed the incriminating burglar tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14957,"title":"Oral Argument - December 11, 1967","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14957"},{"id":15567,"title":"Oral Argument - December 12, 1967","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15567"},{"id":23712,"title":"Oral Argument - December 11, 1967","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23712"}],"citation":{"volume":"392","page":"40","year":"1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26302"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Sunkist grouped these growers into local associations, each with a designated packing house for preparing fruit for market. Most of these associations were comprised entirely of fruit growers operating under a cooperative structure, but about five percent were corporate growers with their own packing houses. An additional fifteen percent of the associations were private for-profit corporations and partnerships; these associations operated by marketing contracts, not by the cooperative structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunkist controlled approximately seventy percent of all oranges produced in Southern California and Arizona. This control manifested in several ways. Each grower in a cooperative local association agreed to market all fruit through his association, to appoint the association as the marketing agent for all his fruit, and to contract with one packing house. While each association reserved the right to decide its prices and markets, Sunkist had sole discretion to pool products for exports, and could set maximum supplies for a given area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Capper-Volstead Act privileged collective activity in processing and marketing in the production of agricultural products. It was enacted to provide an exception to the Sherman Act’s prohibition against combinations in restraint of trade. Case-Swayne manufactured orange juice and other blended juices as an independent operator. It alleged that the Sunkist system was a conspiracy of trade in violation of the Sherman Act and sought treble-damages under the Clayton Act. The district court granted Sunkist’s motion for a directed verdict. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, reversed in part. It held that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Sunkist engaged in monopolistic practices, but also held that the participation of non-producers in Sunkist’s system did not destroy its exempt status under the Capper-Volstead Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Sunkist Growers duly organized under the Capper-Volstead Act\u0027s agricultural collective exemption when fifteen percent of its members are for-profit processors of agricultural products?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-1 decision written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court held that non-producers cannot legally participate in an agricultural collective organized under the Capper-Volstead Act. Justice Marshall looked to the legislative history of the act. While acknowledging that Congress’ principal concern was to prohibit predatory middlemen from participating in agricultural collectives, he noted that the act makes no mention of non-producers except with respect to cooperatives issuing capital stock. He rejected Sunkist’s argument that non-producers’ participation in the collective had no economic significance, pointing to the non-producers’ role in the control and policy making of Sunkist. The Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s decision and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan concurred in part and dissented in part. While agreeing that congress did not intend that non-stock organizations with non-producer members should qualify for a Capper-Volstead antitrust exemption, he feared the possible effects of subjecting Sunkist to broad antitrust liability. He noted that the record contained no evidence that Sunkist intended to evade the act’s mandate. Justice Harlan would have held that Sunkist was not liable under the Sherman Act for past acts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White concurred, joined by Justice Potter Stewart. He agreed that the scope of Capper-Volstead’s exemption was limited to the cooperative efforts of producers, but argued that Sunkist did not lose its antitrust immunity completely. He noted that the bulk of Sunkist’s local associations appear to qualify as exempt organizations, and that the improperly organized associations had no direct authority to conduct Sunkist’s affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas issued a dissenting opinion. He argued that the nature and extent of the non-producers’ participation in Sunkist had not been fully explored; thus, Justice Douglas would have reserved questions of the scope of Sunkist’s immunity for a later date.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44861,"name":"William H.

The Board of Education for New York Central School District No. 1, contending that the law violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, filed suit against James Allen, Commissioner of Education, requesting a declaratory injunction to prevent enforcement of the statute. The trial court agreed with the board and found the statute unconstitutional. The Appellate Division reversed the ruling, finding that the boards lacked standing. On appeal, the New York Court of Appeals ruled the boards did have standing, but also found that, because the law\u0027s purpose was to benefit all students regardless of the type of school they attended, the law did not violate the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment forbid New York from requiring that public school boards loan textbooks to parochial school students without cost?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Byron R.

Prior to 1965, New Kent school taught all white students, while George W. Watkins school taught all African American students.  After \u003ci\u003eBrown v. Board of Education\u003c/i\u003e, the school district implemented a “freedom of choice” plan, where all students could choose which school they wanted to attend.  While the school district did not prevent anyone from attending the school they wanted to, only a few African American students transferred to New Kent and no white students transferred to George W. Watkins.  Several students and parents from the school district brought this action against the school district, arguing that the plan did not adequately integrate the school system.  The district court upheld the plan.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but remanded the case for a more specific order concerning desegregation of teachers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the “freedom of choice plan” violate equal protection where evidence shows that the plan is not likely to bring about desegregation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., writing for a unanimous court, reversed the court of appeals to the extent it affirmed the district court.  The Supreme Court held that the “freedom of choice” plan was not a sufficient step to bring about a desegregated unitary school system.  While the freedom of choice plan may work in some situations, school districts must provide a plan that works to dismantle the segregated system in their district.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42185,"name":"Samuel W.

At trial, the judge admitted in to evidence Evans’ confessions, made to the postal inspector and later to police.  In the confession, Evans names Bruton as his accomplice.  The judge instructed the jury to consider the confession for Evans’ guilt or innocence, but to disregard it as inadmissible hearsay for Bruton’s charges.  The jury convicted both men.  Evans and Bruton appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  That court set aside Evans’ conviction, finding that the confession to the postal inspector should not have been received into evidence.  The court upheld Bruton’s conviction because the district court properly instructed the jury not to use the confession when considering Bruton’s charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas George Bruton substantially prejudiced against when the jury heard an improperly obtained admission by a co-defendant, which implicated Bruton in the crime?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., writing for a 6-2 majority, reversed the lower court.  The Supreme Court held that Bruton was substantially prejudiced against because of the high risk that the jury considered Evans’ confession when deciding Bruton’s guilt.  Admitting Evans’ confession into evidence violated Bruton’s Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination.  This decision expressly overruled \u003ci\u003eDelli Paoli v. United States\u003c/i\u003e.   Justice Potter Stewart concurred, expressing that certain kinds of hearsay are so damaging that jurors cannot be trusted to give that evidence the minimal weight it deserves.  Justice Hugo L. Black also concurred, writing that a jury instruction to use a confession as evidence against one defendant but not the other in the same trial is ineffective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White dissented, stating that juries can be reasonably relied upon to follow jury instructions and disregard certain evidence.  Justice John M. Harlan joined in the dissent. Justice Thurgood Marshall did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21416,"name":"Daniel P.

The Act excluded the federal government or any state government or political subdivision from the definition of \"employer.\" In 1961, the Act was amended to include employees of any enterprise engaged in commerce or production of commerce, such as the operation of a hospital or any place that cares for the sick, a school, or an institution of higher education. The Act also removed the exemption for the state governments and their political subdivisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state of Maryland and twenty-seven other states sued W. Willard Wirtz, the Secretary of Labor, to prevent the enforcement of the Act as it applied to schools and hospitals operated by states or their subdivisions. The states argued this expansion of the Act was unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause and conflicted with the Eleventh Amendment\u0027s protection of states\u0027 sovereign immunity. A three-judge district court held that the extension of the Act\u0027s coverage to commercial enterprise and state institutions did not exceed Congress\u0027 powers under the Commerce Clause because it did not transgress the sovereignty of the states. However, the court declined to consider the Eleventh Amendment issue. Maryland appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the expansion of the Fair Labor Standards Act to include schools and hospitals operated by states or their subdivisions violate the Commerce Clause and the Eleventh Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice John Marshall Harlan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-2 majority. The Court held that the inclusion of commercial enterprises is constitutional because otherwise commercial enterprises that utilize substandard wages and excessive hours would have an advantage over other companies. Substandard labor conditions also lead to labor disputes and strikes, which Congress wanted to avoid. Furthermore, the Court held that the Act did not interfere with states\u0027 sovereignty by telling them how to perform medical and educational functions; rather it subjected a state that employs people performing such functions to the same restrictions as other employers whose activities affect commerce. Therefore, the Court held that minimum wage amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act extending to non-professional, non-executive and non-administrative employers of state public schools, hospitals, and related institutions was also constitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that bringing employees of state-owned enterprises under the auspices of the Fair Labor Standards Act was an invasion of state sovereignty. Requiring states to pay employees minimum wage would force them to increase taxes, lower the standard of services in these institutions, reduce services in other government activities, and refrain from entering into new governmental fields needed for social change. The Act therefore affected the states fiscally and was a clear invasion of state sovereignty. Justice Potter Stewart joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14848,"title":"Oral Argument - April 23, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14848"}],"citation":{"volume":"392","page":"183","year":"1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26339"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Connecticut denied her aid since she did not satisfy the state\u0027s one-year residency requirement. This case was decided together with Washington v. Legrant and Reynolds v. Smith. In Washington, three people applied for and were denied AFDC aid on the ground that they had not resided in the District of Columbia for one year immediately preceding the filing of their application In Reynolds, two appellees, Smith and Foster, were denied AFDC aid on the sole ground that they had not been residents of Pennsylvania for at least a year prior to their applications as required by a Pennsylvania Welfare Code.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the conditioning of AFDC aid on various residency requirements violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that since the regulation touched \"on the fundamental right of interstate movement,\" it must promote a compelling state interest. Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Washington DC, all failed to advance any compelling administrative or social reasons for their requirements.
