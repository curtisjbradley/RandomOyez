A provision in the treaty required that three-fourths of the adult males in each of the Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche tribes agree to subsequent changes to the terms of the treaty. In 1892, Congress attempted to alter the reservation lands granted to the tribes. In enacting the relevant legislation, Congress substantively changed the terms of the treaty and opened 2 million acres of reservation lands to settlement by non-Indians. Lone Wolf filed a complaint on behalf of the three tribes in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, alleging that Congress\u0027 change violated the 1867 treaty. That court dismissed the case. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the decision. Lone Wolf and the tribes appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan treaties between the United States and American Indian tribes be broken unilaterally by Congress under its plenary power? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court affirmed the Court of Appeals and upheld the Congressional action. The Court rejected the Indians\u0027 argument that Congress\u0027 action was a taking under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Justice Edward D. White reasoned that matters involving Indian lands were the sole jurisdiction of Congress. Congress therefore had the power to \"abrogate the provisions of an Indian treaty,\" including the two-million acre change. Justice John M. Harlan concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"187","page":"553","year":"1903","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27201"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15159,"name":"Fuller Court (1902)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/fuller16","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15052,"name":"Melville W.

The Court held that the right of Congress to tax within its delegated powers was essentially \"unrestrained,\" and that \"no want of due process of law could possibly result\" from exercises of that power.

The trust also pressured the railroads into charging them lower-than-normal rates. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt directed his attorney general to bring a lawsuit against the “beef trust” on antitrust grounds pursuant to the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Congress have the authority to regulate the meat trust under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court held that congressional power under the Commerce Clause justified regulations of the “beef trust.” Writing for the majority, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. broadened the meaning of “interstate” commerce to include actions that were part of the “stream of commerce” where the stream was clearly interstate in character. In this case, the stream ran from farm to retail store and crossed many state lines. The federal government’s victory in this case encouraged it to pursue other antitrust actions, and Congress followed by passing the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act in 1906. \u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"196","page":"375","year":"1905","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27204"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15155,"name":"Fuller Court (1903-1906)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/fuller19","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15052,"name":"Melville W.

Lochner was accused of permitting an employee to work more than 60 hours in one week. The first charge resulted in a fine of $25, and a second charge a few years later resulted in a fine of $50. While Lochner did not challenge his first conviction, he appealed the second, but was denied in state court. Before the Supreme Court, he argued that the Fourteenth Amendment should have been interpreted to contain the freedom to contract among the rights encompassed by substantive due process. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Bakeshop Act violate the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court invalidated the New York law. The majority maintained that the statute interfered with the freedom of contract, and thus the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s right to liberty afforded to employer and employee. The Court further held that the New York law failed the rational basis test for determining whether government action is constitutional. The majority reasoned that the Bakeshop Act had no rational basis because long working hours did not dramatically undermine the health of employees, and baking is not particularly dangerous. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroadly interpreting state authority to regulate under its police powers, Justice Harlan in his dissent articulated reasoning that would inform later decisions in the post-\u003cem\u003eLochner\u003c/em\u003e era.

The Texas Railroad Commission mandated that they charge higher rates on freight travelling between Louisiana and Texas than on freight travelling solely within Texas. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) found that the interstate rates were unreasonable and illegally discriminated against freight traffic originating in Shreveport. The ICC established maximum rates and ordered the railroads to fix their intrastate rate schedules. The railroads challenged the order in United States Commerce Court, alleging that the ICC did not have the power to regulate intrastate commerce. The Commerce Court upheld the ICC order. The railroads then appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the ICC have the power to regulate the railroads\u0027 intrastate rates?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 decision, the Court affirmed the Commerce Court and upheld the ICC order. Congress was granted the power to regulate interstate commerce, which it chose to do through the ICC. This power extended to \"matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic,\" Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for the majority. Since the price discrimination adversely affected interstate commerce, \"it is immaterial…that the discrimination arises from intrastate rates as compared with interstate rates.\" Therefore, the railroads\u0027 intrastate rates were subject to regulation and the ICC order was valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"234","page":"342","year":"1914","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27218"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15320,"name":"White Court (1912-1914)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/white4","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15144,"name":"Edward D.

Frohwerk was charged with violating the Espionage Act of 1917 because the government believed he sought to cause disloyalty and refusal of duty. A trial court found Frohwerk guilty and sentenced him to a fine and imprisonment. On appeal, Frohwerk challenged the statute under the  First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Frohwerk\u0027s conviction under the Espionage Act of 1917 violate his right to free speech under the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the Court concluded that Frohwerk’s conviction was valid. The Court reasoned that the federal government has a valid interest in protecting the recruitment of members of the armed forces, and that in publishing the articles, Frohwerk engaged in a conspiracy to disrupt such recruitment. The Court dismissed the argument that Frohwerk never intended to obstruct recruitment, noting that \"conspiracy to obstruct recruiting would be criminal even if no means were agreed upon specifically by which to accomplish the intent.\" Of note, the Court reasserted its conclusion in Schenck v.

Articulating for the first time the “clear and present danger test,” Holmes concluded that the First Amendment does not protect speech that approaches creating a clear and present danger of a significant evil that Congress has power to prevent. Holmes reasoned that the widespread dissemination of the leaflets was sufficiently likely to disrupt the conscription process.

Russian immigrants in the US circulated literature calling for a general strike in ammunition plants to undermine the US war effort. The defendants were convicted for two leaflets thrown from a New York City window. One denounced the sending of American troops to Russia, and the second denounced the war and advocated for the cessation of the production of weapons to be used against \"Workers Soviets of Russia\". They were sentenced to 20 years in prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the amendments to the Espionage Act or the application of those amendments in this case violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that in calling for a general strike and the curtailment of munitions production, the leaflets violated the Espionage Act. Congress’ determination that all such propaganda posed a danger to the war effort was sufficient to meet the standard set in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/249us47\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSchenck v.

As in Schenck, the Court emphasized that protections on speech are lower during wartime. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes argued that the First Amendment protects the right to dissent from the government’s viewpoints and objectives. Protections on speech, he continued, should not be curtailed unless there is a present danger of immediate evil, or the defendant intends to create such a danger. The evidence in this case consisted of two leaflets, which he concluded did not meet the “clear and present danger” test. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28418,"name":"Harry Weinberger","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harry_weinberger","view_count":0,"last_name":"Weinberger","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"harry_weinberger"},"advocate_description":"for the plaintiffs in error","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21299"},{"advocate":{"ID":40490,"name":"Robert P.

Congress passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 in order to facilitate enforcement of the treaty. When Ray P. Holland, the U.S. Game Warden, threatened to arrest citizens of Missouri for violating the Act, the state of Missouri challenged the treaty. The state argued that the constitution gave Congress no enumerated power to regulate migratory bird hunting, and thus the regulation of such hunting was the province of the states according to the Tenth Amendment.  \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the treaty infringe upon rights reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 7-to-2 decision authored by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the Court upheld the exercise of the treaty power and found no violation of the Tenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that the national interest in protecting wildlife could be protected only by national action. The Court further reasoned that the Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2) renders treaties the “supreme law of the land,” a finding that trumps any state-level concerns with regard to the provisions of any treaty. The Supremacy Clause further implied that the treaty provisions were not subject to questioning by the states under the process of judicial review. \u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"252","page":"416","year":"1920","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27227"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15318,"name":"White Court (1916-1921)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/white8","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15144,"name":"Edward D.

The Ohio Constitution, in a 1918 amendment, provided that amendments to the United States Constitution would be subject to a statewide referendum after ratification by the General Assembly. Consistent with this requirement, the Ohio Secretary of State, Harvey Smith, began to print and issue ballots for the referendum. George Hawke challenged the validity of amendment to the Ohio Constitution and sought to have Smith stop the issuing of ballots. He alleged that the Ohio amendment conflicted with Article Five of the United States Constitution, which specified that amendments would be ratified by state legislatures. The Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County ruled against him. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals of Franklin County and the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Ohio\u0027s 1918 amendment providing that amendments to the United States Constitution should be subject to a referendum conflict with Article Five of the United States Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous decision, the Court reversed the Supreme Court of Ohio and ruled that Ohio\u0027s referendum provision conflicted with Article Five. In an opinion written by Justice William R. Day, the Court held that Article Five\u0027s ratification requirement was \"limited to two methods, by action of the legislatures of three-fourths of the States, or conventions in a like number of States.\" The term \"legislatures\" in Article Five referred to a \"representative body which made the laws of the people,\" which is precisely what the Ohio General Assembly was set to be in the Ohio Constitution. Though the Ohio Constitution did grant some legislative power to the people through referendums, the \"ratification by a State of a constitution amendment is not an act of legislation within the proper sense,\" but instead an \"expression of the assent of the State to a proposed amendment.\" Article Five specified that this assent could only be provided by a legislature or a convention, not a referendum. Therefore, Ohio\u0027s referendum requirement was unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"253","page":"221","year":"1920","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27228"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15318,"name":"White Court (1916-1921)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/white8","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15144,"name":"Edward D.

Clyne.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Congress have authority under the Commerce Clause to pass and enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 7-to-1 decision, the Court held that the activities controlled by the Act did indeed burden the freedom of commerce and fell within the regulatory jurisdiction of Congress. The Court argued that Congress did not have to wait until after deleterious economic monopolies had developed to regulate particular industries. Drawing on its decision in Swift v. United States, the Court found that business done in the stockyards was an essential part of interstate commerce and thus subject to national legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"258","page":"495","year":"1922","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27229"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15283,"name":"Taft Court (1921-1922)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/taft1","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15146,"name":"William Howard Taft","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_howard_taft","view_count":0,"last_name":"Taft","roles":[{"id":2794,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1529780400,"date_end":-1259431200,"appointing_president":"Warren G.

Mahon in 1878 to gain full rights to mine the coal located beneath his surface-level property. However in 1921 the state of Pennsylvania passed the Kohler Act, which prohibited miners from extracting below-surface coal that supported surface-level buildings. When Pennsylvania Coal notified Mahon that it would mine coal beneath his property, Mahon filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas to prohibit mining in accordance with the Kohler Act. The court denied his suit but the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed and allowed the ban on mining. Pennsylvania Coal contended that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment protected its contractual rights to the coal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Kohler Act restrict coal mining to an extent that violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment by depriving mine owners of coal without compensation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWriting for an 8-1 Court, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes ruled that the Kohler Act violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. He reasoned the state exceeded its police powers by significantly diminishing the value of the land estates without having a strong public interest reason to do so. The Court reasoned that \"so far as private persons or communities have seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that the fact that their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them greater rights than they bought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dissent, Justice Brandeis argued for what is now called the nuisance exception: if a land use is itself noxious, dangerous, or causes a public nuisance, the legislature is free to regulate its use without compensation, even though the police power may cause great loss to the property owner. In this case, he reasoned, the police power applied insofar as the Kohler Act prohibited a noxious use of the subsidence of buildings. Brandeis further argued that the diminution-of-value test presented by the majority was flawed because value is relative and cannot be determined by a court of law. \u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"260","page":"393","year":"1922","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27232"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15279,"name":"Taft Court (1922)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/taft4","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15146,"name":"William Howard Taft","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_howard_taft","view_count":0,"last_name":"Taft","roles":[{"id":2794,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1529780400,"date_end":-1259431200,"appointing_president":"Warren G.

D.C.’s Children’s Hospital, which employed many women, sought an injunction against enforcing the law. The injunction was denied in the trial court but granted in the intermediate appellate court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the minimum wage law violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe majority struck down the minimum wage law as unconstitutional. The Court relied on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/198us45\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLochner v. New York\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which struck down a law limiting bakers’ working hours under the Due Process Clause, which they believed contained a right of “freedom to contract.” In Adkins, the Court reasoned that the same reasoning extended to a minimum wage law. Employer and employee, according to the majority, had a constitutional right to contract in whatever manner they pleased. Thus, the minimum wage law unjustly interfered with the freedom to contract. Moreover, the Court reasoned that women do no merit greater protection than men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dissent, Justices William Howard Taft, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and Edward T.

Gitlow was convicted under New York’s Criminal Anarchy Law, which punished advocating the overthrow of the government by force. At his trial, Gitlow argued that since there was no resulting action flowing from the manifesto\u0027s publication, the statute penalized utterances without propensity to incitement of concrete action. The appellate division affirmed his conviction, as did the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in that state.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment prevent a state from punishing political speech that directly advocates the government\u0027s violent overthrow?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Edward Sanford, the Court concluded that New York could prohibit advocating violent efforts to overthrow the government under the Criminal Anarchy Law. Citing \u003cem\u003eSchenck\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAbrams\u003c/em\u003e, the Court reasoned the government could punish speech that threatens its basic existence because of the national security implications. Despite the small scale of Gitlow’s actions, the majority was not persuaded that they were too insignificant to have an impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court previously held, in \u003cem\u003eBarron v. Baltimore\u003c/em\u003e (1833), that the Constitution\u0027s Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government. \u003cem\u003eGitlow\u003c/em\u003e partly reversed that precedent and established that while the Bill of Rights was designed to limit the power of the federal government, the incorporation principle allows it to be applied to states. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dissent, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes held that Gitlow had not violated the clear and present danger test used in \u003cem\u003eSchenck\u003c/em\u003e. Since Gitlow’s call to action was abstract and would not resonate with a large number of people, Holmes concluded that there was not sufficient imminence to warrant punishing the speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45818,"name":"Walter H.

On November 13, 1922, the village council passed a zoning ordinance dividing the village into several districts. The ordinance defined the use and size of buildings permissible in each district. Ambler Realty\u0027s land spanned multiple districts, and the company was therefore significantly restricted in the types of buildings it could construct on the land. Ambler Realty filed suit against the village, claiming the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s protections of liberty and property described in the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. A federal district court agreed and issued an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the village of Euclid\u0027s zoning ordinance violate Ambler Realty\u0027s rights to liberty and property under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice George Sutherland, the Court concluded that the speculative damages claimed by Ambler Realty were insufficient to invalidate an otherwise valid exercise of the village\u0027s police power. While Ambler had standing to sue, the Court rejected its arguments on the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance, which it found neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. Applying a deferential standard of review, as the Court typically applies to constitutional challenges to economic regulations, the Court held the ordinance did not exceed the local government’s police power.

Nixon, was an African American citizen of the United States and Texas who lived in El Paso. He was a registered Democratic voter and on July 26, 1924, Nixon attempted to vote in a primary election. Based on a Texas statute passed in May 1923 that prevented African Americans from voting, Nixon was unable to vote. He sued the Judges of Election and argued that the statute violated his Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights. The defendants motioned for dismissal by arguing that the subject matter of the case was political and therefore did not fall within the jurisdiction of the court.

Whitney argued that she had not intended the organization to act this way and did not plan to aid it in those objectives. She claimed the California law violated the First Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Criminal Syndicalism Act violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court sustained Whitney\u0027s conviction and held that the Act did not violate the Constitution. The Court found that the Act violated neither the Due Process nor the Equal Protection Clauses, and that freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment was not an absolute right. The Court held that the state, in exercise of its police power, can punish those who abuse their rights to freedom of speech \"by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to incite crime, disturb the public peace, or endanger the foundations of organized government and threaten its overthrow.\" In other words, words with a \"bad tendency\" can be punished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting a separate concurrence, Justice Louis Brandeis, joined by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, argued that restrictions on government action under the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not extend to situations in which speech creates a clear and present danger of an evil outcome. The actions that the defendant took posed only a remote potential harm to the public, and she was involved only in contributing to the preparation of the actions. To satisfy the clear and present danger standard, the risk of harm must be severe, probable, and imminent. Broad statements advocating for revolution at some indefinite date in the future are protected by the First Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Brandeis and Holmes concurred rather than dissented because the record showed evidence of a criminal conspiracy, which meant review was inappropriate without proof that constitutional rights were infringed during the criminal trial. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"274","page":"357","year":"1927","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27244"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15277,"name":"Taft Court (1925-1930)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/taft9","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15146,"name":"William Howard Taft","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_howard_taft","view_count":0,"last_name":"Taft","roles":[{"id":2794,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1529780400,"date_end":-1259431200,"appointing_president":"Warren G.

Schoene, the Virginia State Entomologist, ordered Miller to cut down his red cedar trees pursuant to the Cedar Rust Act of Virginia. Miller\u0027s property was near an apple orchard, and Virginia did not want the cedar rust plant disease to spread from Miller\u0027s trees to the apple orchard. The state provided no compensation for destroying the red cedars. Miller alleged that this was a government taking requiring compensation and that the Cedar Rust Act violated the due process clause. The Virginia courts upheld the tree removal order. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Virginia\u0027s Cedar Rust Act violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court upheld Virginia\u0027s statute and the order to remove Miller\u0027s cedar trees. A unanimous decision by Justice Harlan Stone found that the statute and the order to remove Miller\u0027s cedar trees did not violate the due process clause. The Court recognized the State\u0027s interest in preventing the cedar rust from damaging nearby apple orchards as they were the \"principal agriculture pursuit\" in the state. The Court held that the destruction of Miller\u0027s trees would be a taking of his property; however, the State \"did not exceed its constitutional powers by deciding upon the destruction of one class of property in order to save another which, in the judgment of the legislature, is of greater value to the public.\" In sum, the legislature acted reasonably in determining that apples were more valuable to the state\u0027s interests than red cedar.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"276","page":"272","year":"1928","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27245"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15277,"name":"Taft Court (1925-1930)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/taft9","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15146,"name":"William Howard Taft","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_howard_taft","view_count":0,"last_name":"Taft","roles":[{"id":2794,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-1529780400,"date_end":-1259431200,"appointing_president":"Warren G.

United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the use of evidence disclosed in wiretapped private telephone conversations, violate the recorded party\u0027s Fourth and Fifth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court held that neither the Fourth nor Fifth Amendment rights of the recorded parties were violated. The use of wiretapped conversations as incriminating evidence did not violate their Fifth Amendment protection against self incrimination because they were not forcibly or illegally made to conduct those conversations. Instead, the conversations were voluntarily made between the parties and their associates. Moreover, the parties\u0027 Fourth Amendment rights were not infringed because mere wiretapping does not constitute a search and seizure under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. These terms refer to an actual physical examination of one\u0027s person, papers, tangible material effects, or home - not their conversations. Finally, the Court added that while wiretapping may be unethical no court may exclude evidence solely for moral reasons. When criticized for his opinion, Justice Taft mocked his foes as he wrote to a friend: \"If they think we are going to be frightened in our effort to stand by the law and give the public a chance to punish criminals, they are mistaken, even though we are condemned for lack of high ideals.\" This case was reversed by Katz v. U.S. (1967).\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29947,"name":"John F.

The youth camp for working-class children was maintained by a number of different groups and organizations, some of which were either openly Communist or had expressed sympathy for the Communist Party\u0027s goals. The law prohibited displaying such a flag for any of three reasons: (1) “as a sign, symbol, or emblem of opposition to organized government”; (2) “as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action”; or (3) “as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character”. Stromberg argued that the law violated the First Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. The judge overruled the objection and a jury convicted Stromberg. The District Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid a state law prohibitng people from flying red flags as a political statement violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWriting for a 7-2 majority, Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes reversed the conviction because the first reason for prohibiting display of a red flag—“as a sign, symbol, or emblem of opposition to organized government”—was unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that where the jury convicted a defendant generally under any or all of the three reasons, and one of those reasons is struck down, the conviction cannot stand. The Court upheld the second two reasons—“as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action” or “as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character”—because they protected against incitement to violence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice James C. McReynolds dissented, writing that Stromberg’s conviction should stand because the jury convicted her under valid parts of the California law as well. Justice Pierce Butler wrote a separate dissent, writing that the records shows that Stromberg was not convicted under the unconstitutional reason at all, so the conviction should stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29135,"name":"John Beardsley","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/john_beardsley","view_count":0,"last_name":"Beardsley","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"john_beardsley"},"advocate_description":"for the appellant","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21925"},{"advocate":{"ID":32672,"name":"John D.

Minnesota officials sought a permanent injunction against The Saturday Press on the grounds that it violated the Public Nuisance Law because it was malicious, scandalous, and defamatory. The law provided that any person \"engaged in the business\" of regularly publishing or circulating an \"obscene, lewd, and lascivious\" or a \"malicious, scandalous and defamatory\" newspaper or periodical was guilty of a nuisance, and could be enjoined from further committing or maintaining the nuisance. The state supreme court upheld both the temporary injunction and the permanent injunction that eventually issued from the trial court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Minnesota \"gag law\" violate the free press provision of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Chief Justice Charles Hughes, the Court held that the statute authorizing the injunction was facially unconstitutional, meaning the decision was based on an analysis of the law\u0027s general applications, not the specific context of this case. The Court held that the statutory scheme constituted a prior restraint and hence was invalid under the First Amendment. (The majority used the incorporation doctrine to apply the rights granted under the Bill of Rights to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.) The Court established as a constitutional principle the doctrine that, with some narrow exceptions, the government could not censor or otherwise prohibit a publication in advance, even though the communication might be punishable after publication in a criminal or other proceeding. In some situations, such as when speech is obscene, incites violence, or reveals military secrets, the government might be able to justify a prior restraint. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Butler, Van Devanter, McReynolds, and Sutherland dissented in an opinion written by Justice Butler. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45258,"name":"Weymouth Kirkland","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/weymouth_kirkland","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kirkland","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"weymouth_kirkland"},"advocate_description":"for Near","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21185"},{"advocate":{"ID":31807,"name":"James E.

Arguing that the tariff was a tax that the university, as an institution serving an instrumentality of a state, should be exempt from paying, the university challenged the tariff before the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. The court rejected the claim, asserting that the act was an exercise of Congress\u0027 authority to regulate commerce under Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, rather than a tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the University of Illinois be required to pay tariffs required by the Tariff Act of 1922 on equipment it imports for educational purposes?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion authored by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the Court read the act as an exercise of Congress\u0027 power under the Commerce Clause. The Chief Justice noted that, while the laying of duties is a tax, and the power to tax and the power to regulate commerce are distinct, \"it does not follow that duties may not be imposed in the exercise of the power to regulate commerce.\" If Congress asserts that it is exercising its power under the Commerce Clause, the Court concluded, \"the judicial department may not attempt in its own conception of policy to distribute the duties thus fixed by allocating some of them to the…power to regulate commerce and others to…the taxing power.\" Therefore, because \"no State by virtue of any interest of its own would be entitled to override\" Congress\u0027 power under the Commerce Clause, the tariff may be levied.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"289","page":"48","year":"1933","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27252"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15346,"name":"Hughes Court (1932-1937)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/hughes5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15038,"name":"Charles E.

The law extended the time period in which borrowers could pay back their debts on property to lenders. A court granted an extension to the Blaisdells under this statute while also requiring them to pay $40 a month during the extended period to Home Building and Loan Association, which was the mortgagor of their home.

The court reasoned that there are limitations on the doctrine embedded in the Contracts Clause (Section 10 of Article I). There may be a public need to restrain private rights to further the public interest when there is an emergency. The Framers of the Constitution could not have foreseen all possible modern problems, so the Constitution should not be interpreted in too rigid a way to allow for responding to them. This statute met the relevant five-factor test because there was a genuine emergency, the legislation was designed to help the public in general, the relief was narrowly tailored to the problem, the mortgagor\u0027s interests were not seriously undermined, and the legislation is temporary.

The order prohibited transporting petroleum and petroleum products in interstate and foreign commerce if they had been produced in excess of the amounts permitted by states. Panama Refining Co. operated an oil refinery and sought an injunction against enforcing the regulations that were created under the NIRA. It succeeded in the lower court, but the intermediate appellate court removed the injunction. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the executive order regulating petroleum commerce constitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWriting for the 8-1 majority, Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes concluded the order was not constitutional. Supreme Court held that in enacting the order, the President subsumed legislative powers that Congress does not have the power to delegate. Congress cannot delegate legislative powers to other branches of government in order to sustain the democratic system of government. When it allows the executive branch to make rules, Congress must provide policies and standards for formulating them. This was not the case in the regulation of oil transportation. The lack of any limits on executive discretion concerned the Court and rendered the order unconstitutional. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Benjamin Cardozo argued that there were enough standards to guide the President’s actions so that the delegation of power is constitutional. The President was essentially enforcing Congress’ goals of regulating interstate commerce to prevent unfair competition and the misuse of resources. He also argued that the elasticity of government is crucial for the government to continue to function when faced with new problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23926,"name":"F.

Perry failed to show that the change in coin weight had cause him any actual damages.  Justice James C.

R. Grovey, an African-American, attempted to vote in the Democratic primary election held on July 28, 1934 and was denied a ballot by the county clerk specifically because of his race. The whites-only restriction of the Texas Democratic Party had been passed by a convention in May 1932. Grovey sued, arguing the restriction violated his rights under the Fifteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A Justice Court in Texas denied his claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Democratic Party\u0027s refusal to allow Grovey a ballot in the primary election violate his rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Owen Roberts, the Court concluded that the party\u0027s restriction had not been authorized or endorsed by the state and therefore was free from the limitations of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The Court had previously ruled in \u003cem\u003eNixon v. Herndon\u003c/em\u003e (1927) and \u003cem\u003eNixon v. Condon\u003c/em\u003e (1932) that the state could not impose such race-based limitations in primaries. However, Justice Roberts noted that the party\u0027s rule in Grovey\u0027s case could not be limited by the amendments. Justice Roberts wrote that \"the Democratic party in that state is a voluntary political association and, by its representatives assembled in convention, has the power to determine who shall be eligible for membership and, as such, eligible to participate in the party\u0027s primaries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"295","page":"45","year":"1935","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27258"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15346,"name":"Hughes Court (1932-1937)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/hughes5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15038,"name":"Charles E.

However, the FTC Act only allowed a president to remove a commissioner for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" Since Humphrey died shortly after being dismissed, his executor sued to recover Humphrey\u0027s lost salary.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid section 1 of the Federal Trade Commission Act unconstitutionally interfere with the executive power of the President?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe unanimous Court found that the FTC Act was constitutional and that Humphrey\u0027s dismissal on policy grounds was unjustified. The Court reasoned that the Constitution had never given \"illimitable power of removal\" to the president. Justice Sutherland dismissed the government\u0027s main line of defense in this case which relied heavily on the Court\u0027s decision in Myers v. United States (1926). In that case the Court upheld the president\u0027s right to remove officers who were \"units of the executive department.\" The FTC was different, argued Sutherland, because it was a body created by Congress to perform quasi-legislative and judicial functions. The Myers precedent, therefore, did not apply in this situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"295","page":"602","year":"1935","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27260"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15346,"name":"Hughes Court (1932-1937)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/hughes5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15038,"name":"Charles E.

For example, projects of the TVA included improving navigation on the state\u0027s rivers, constructing flood control projects, and generating hydroelectric power. Shareholders in a private Tennessee power company sued to prevent the TVA from acquiring over half of the company\u0027s property and equipment. The proposed contract which detailed the sale would allow the government agency to allocate electric power to consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Congress exceed its power in implementing and administering the TVA?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court held that Congress did not abuse its power with the TVA. Justice Hughes argued that the Wilson Dam, the location where the TVA was in the business of generating electricity, had been built originally in the interest of national defense: it produced materials involved in munitions manufacture. The government could sell excess electricity to consumers without violating the Constitution. This case is especially important for the concept of judicial review as expressed in Justice Brandeis\u0027s concurrence.. Brandeis articulated a set of \"rules\" governing the appropriateness of judicial review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"297","page":"288","year":"1936","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27262"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15346,"name":"Hughes Court (1932-1937)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/hughes5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15038,"name":"Charles E.

The Act regulated prices, minimum wages, maximum hours, and \"fair practices\" of the coal industry. Although compliance was voluntary, tax refunds were established as incentives to abide by the regulations. Carter, a stockholder, brought suit against his own company in an attempt to keep it from paying the tax for noncompliance. This case was decided together with R.C. Tway Coal Co. v. Clark, R.C. Tway Coal Co. v. Glenn, and Halvering v. Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 exceed congressional powers under the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5 to 4 decision, the Court held that the 1935 Act overstepped the bounds of congressional power. The Court ruled that \"commerce\" is plainly distinct from \"production.\" Employing workers, setting wages and working hours, and mining coal were found to be part of the local process of production, separate from any trade of goods that could be regulated under the Commerce Clause. In striking down the law, Justice Sutherland argued that \"[e]verything which moves in interstate commerce has had a local origin. Without local production somewhere, interstate commerce. . . would practically disappear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"298","page":"238","year":"1936","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27263"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15346,"name":"Hughes Court (1932-1937)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/hughes5","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15038,"name":"Charles E.

This violated a Joint Resolution of Congress and a proclamation issued by President Roosevelt, which banned U.S. weapons manufacturers from aiding either side of the war. Challenging its indictment, Curtiss-Wright argued that Congress had violated the non-delegation doctrine in allowing the executive branch to make decisions that were properly left to the legislature. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn the Joint Resolution, did Congress unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to the President?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion written by Justice Sutherland, the majority upheld the Joint Resolution. The Court reasoned that the federal government could not exceed its enumerated powers regarding internal issues but had a much broader scope of discretion in foreign affairs. Because \"the President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation,\" Congress may provide the President with a special degree of discretion in external matters which would not be afforded domestically. Roosevelt thus had the discretion to determine what impact a certain policy might have on foreign affairs and make decisions accordingly, even had Congress not authorized him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice McReynolds authored a dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35629,"name":"Martin Conboy","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/martin_conboy","view_count":0,"last_name":"Conboy","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"martin_conboy"},"advocate_description":"for the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21273"},{"advocate":{"ID":25735,"name":"George Z.

While the meeting was in progress, police raided it. De Jonge was arrested and charged with violating the State\u0027s criminal syndicalism statute. The law defines criminal syndicalism as \"the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, sabotage or any unlawful acts or methods as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political change or revolution.\" After being convicted, De Jonge moved for an acquittal, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to warrant his conviction. Disagreeing, the State Supreme Court distinguished that the indictment did not charge De Jonge with criminal syndicalism, but rather that he presided at, conducted and assisted in conducting an assemblage of persons, organization, society and group called by the Communist Party, which was unlawfully teaching and advocating in Multnomah county the doctrine of criminal syndicalism and sabotage.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Oregon\u0027s criminal syndicalism statute violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes, the Court held that the Oregon statute, as applied, violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After reviewing the record, the Court determined that De Jonge\u0027s sole offense was assisting in a public meeting held under the auspices of the Communist Party. The Court reasoned that to preserve the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly - principles embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment - not the auspices under which a meeting is held, but the purpose of the meeting and whether the speakers\u0027 remarks transcend the bounds of freedom of speech must be examined, which had not occurred in De Jonge\u0027s case.

Oregon\u003c/em\u003e (1908)\u003c/a\u003e, the majority ruled that the state may use its police power to restrict the individual freedom to contract. The decision overruled \u003cem\u003eAdkins\u003c/em\u003e and marked the Court\u0027s departure from the expansive view of the freedom to contract. The decision is generally regarded as having ended the \u003cem\u003eLochner\u003c/em\u003e era, a period in American legal history in which the Supreme Court tended to invalidate legislation aimed at regulating business. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Justice Hughes wrote the opinion, the stark doctrinal shift resulted from Justice Owen Josephus Roberts changing his perspective on this issue. According to Hughes, President Franklin Roosevelt\u0027s reelection in 1936 and the impressive achievements of the New Deal caused Roberts to abandon his affiliation with the Court\u0027s conservative justices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dissent, Justice George Sutherland implicitly criticized Roberts for changing sides and argued that politics and public opinion should not impact the Court’s understanding of the Constitution. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23121,"name":"E.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) charged Jones \u0026amp; Laughlin Steel Co. the country’s fourth largest steel producer, with discriminating against employees who were union members.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the NLRA consistent with the Commerce Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the majority found that companies cannot discriminate against employees for exercising their fundamental right to unionize. The Court upheld the Act, reasoning that it was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial activities which had the potential to restrict interstate commerce. The majority stated that any significant effect (direct or indirect) on interstate commerce allows Congress to regulate an activity under the Commerce Clause. While the manufacturing process or relationships between labor and management may not have a direct impact on the flow of goods, they have an aggregate impact on commerce. In this case, the potential secession of manufacturing activity due to conflicts between management and labor could potentially impede interstate commerce. However, Hughes carefully limited the opinion to exclude situations in which an activity had such an inconsequential or remote impact on interstate commerce that it exclusively impacted local matters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dissent, Justice McReynolds questioned Congress\u0027s enhanced power under the Commerce Clause. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31981,"name":"J.

The Act imposed a tax on employers of eight or more employees to fund unemployment compensation. If a state had established an approved compensation plan, however, the taxpayer could credit up to 90% of the federal tax paid to the state unemployment fund. Steward argued that with the Act, Congress surpassed its powers outlined in the Tenth Amendment.   \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Act arbitrarily impose taxes in violation of the Fifth Amendment or subvert principles of federalism?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that the tax under the Social Security Act was a constitutional exercise of congressional power. Writing for the majority, Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo found that the tax did not coerce the states in contravention of the Tenth Amendment. The Court underscored the high rate of unemployment and poorly performing economy in concluding that the tax would benefit the general welfare. According to the majority, the Act would benefit both the states and the federal government. The majority rejected the argument that the Act provision was void as involving an unconstitutional attempt to coerce the States to adopt unemployment compensation legislation approved by the Federal Government. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dissenting opinions, Justices McReynolds, Sutherland, Van Devanter, and Butler viewed the Social Security Act as a Congressional overreach.

Barnwell Bros, Inc., an interstate trucking company, argued that this was an unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce. The lower court agreed and granted an injunction.

Writing for unanimous Court, Justice Harlan Fiske Stone reasoned that Congress had not enacted regulations in this area, so the states remained free to regulate in it. States cannot impose burdens on interstate commerce by crafting laws that are designed to create an advantage for local businesses, even if they only relate to local matters. In this instance, however, the law closely related to a matter of substantial local concern, since the states own and maintain their own highways. The Court held that in the absence of congressional action, federal courts may not determine the details of motor vehicle regulations, as that would exceed the proper scope of the judicial role and infringe on legislative powers. \u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"303","page":"177","year":"1938","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27272"},"first_party_label":"Petitioner","second_party_label":"Respondent","heard_by":[{"ID":15350,"name":"Hughes Court (1937-1938)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/courts/hughes7","view_count":0,"members":[{"ID":15038,"name":"Charles E.

However, in a likely instance of forum shopping, he filed a lawsuit against the railroad company in a federal court in New York, where the corporation was a resident. A federal court jury awarded Tompkins damages. The 1842 Supreme Court decision in \u003cem\u003eSwift v. Tyson\u003c/em\u003e ruled that federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction should apply federal common law to non-statutory causes of action. Whereas federal common law applied an ordinary negligence standard for the duty of care owed by railroads to people in his situation, Pennsylvania state law would have required Tompkins to show wanton negligence. The payment of Tompkins’s award was stayed during the proceedings. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction apply state or federal law? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWriting for the majority, Justice Louis Dembitz Brandeis decided that it was time to depart from the rule in \u003cem\u003eSwift\u003c/em\u003e and seek greater uniformity in how the law is applied. Arguing that the \u003cem\u003eSwift\u003c/em\u003e decision went beyond the boundaries of the appropriate constitutional role for the judicial branch, Brandeis wrote that federal courts are not entitled to create their own common law for issues that properly fall within state law. He also suggested that the impact of that decision created vertical separation of powers concerns involving the federal government and the states. Instead, he felt that applying state substantive law would lead to more predictable outcomes for litigants and greater efficiency for courts. Thus, the Court concluded that in diversity jurisdiction cases, courts should apply substantive state law and federal procedural law unless there is a conflict between substantive state and federal law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stanley Forman Reed concurred, arguing that the \u003cem\u003eSwift\u003c/em\u003e ruling was erroneous rather than unconstitutional. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Pierce Butler and Clark McReynolds dissented.

Because Lincoln University did not have a law school, he applied to the University of Missouri Law School. He was refused admission and told that admitting him would be contrary to Missouri’s state constitution, laws, and public policy. Gaines argued that this denial of admission violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights and sued to force the Board of Regents to admit him. The circuit court denied his petitions, and the Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Gaines’ denial of admission to the University of Missouri Law School violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the 6-2 majority. The Court held that by establishing Lincoln University as a state university for black students, the state of Missouri established precedent for providing equal opportunity in higher education for both black and white students. Therefore, the denial of access to legal education was unlawful discrimination. The Court also held that the state’s intent to eventually create a law school at Lincoln University was not enough to absolve the responsibility to provide a legal education in this case. The Court held that Missouri failed in its constitutional duty to provide equal protection under the law by failing to provide equal access to public education within the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice McReynolds wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that education was a states’ right issue, and there can only be federal interference when there is a “clear and unmistakable disregard of rights.” Because the state of Missouri was prepared to pay Gaines’ tuition at an out-of-state law school, Gaines would still have access to a legal education and therefore was not being denied his rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19148,"name":"Charles H.

Under Article V of the Constitution, three-fourths of state legislatures must ratify an amendment passed by Congress before it becomes part of the Constitution. After both houses of the Kansas legislature had rejected the proposed amendment in 1925, the Kansas house passed a resolution of ratification in 1937. The Kansas senate then equally divided (20-20) on the resolution, and the Lieutenant Governor, over the objections of those who opposed the amendment, broke the tie in favor of ratification. Kansas legislators challenged the action in state court and it ultimately made its way to the Supreme Court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Kansas’s ratification of the Child Labor Amendment valid? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, the Court held that the Kansas legislators had standing to sue, but found that two of the plaintiffs’ claims raised political questions that could only be resolved by Congress. With respect to the whether the Kansas legislature’s previous rejection of the Child Labor Amendment precluded its subsequent ratification, the Court stated that this “should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the amendment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurrence, Justice Black (joined by Justices Frankfurter, Roberts, and Douglas) suggested that the Court had not gone far enough in denying judicial power to resolve Article V controversies. Black believed that all Article V questions should be considered political and not judiciable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Butler and McReynolds dissented.

Berger, Adolph Germer, William F. Kruse, J. Louis Engdahl, and Irwin St. John Tucker were all indicted and charged with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Their case was assigned to Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and the defendants moved to have another judge preside over the trial under Section 21 of the Judicial Code, which states that, whenever a party to an action files an affidavit that the judge before whom the action is proceeding has a personal bias or prejudice, another judge will be designated to hear the case. In this case, the defendants provided an affidavit alleging that Judge Landis was biased against people of German descent, and several of the defendants were German. The motion was denied, Judge Landis heard the case, and the defendants were convicted. The defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which certified questions of law about Section 21 to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the filing of an affidavit of personal bias or personal prejudice require the judge in question to remove himself from the case?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIf the affidavit is sufficient to establish that the judge in question has a personal bias or prejudice regarding the case, then Section 21 requires that the judge remove himself from the case. Justice Joseph McKenna delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the language of Section 21 is clear and unambiguous in stating that the “judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be designated.” However, the absolutism of that statement is moderated by requirement that the affidavit detailing the relevant personal bias or prejudice allege sufficient facts to support the claim of bias and show that it is more than merely a belief. When a sufficient affidavit is filed under Section 21, it triggers a duty for the judge in question to remove himself from the case, as Judge Landis should have done in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William R. Day wrote a dissent in which he argued that Section 21 was not intended to require a judge to remove himself from the case based on the filing of an affidavit sufficient to establish a claim of personal bias. Instead, the duty is only imposed when the affidavit is sufficient to stand up to a challenge. In this case, the affidavit in question was not sufficient to trigger the duty for Judge Landis to remove himself from the case. Justice Mahlon Pitney joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice James C. McReynolds wrote that Section 21 required an affidavit that alleged personal bias against the particular party to the case in question; an affidavit that alleged personal bias against a group to which the party belonged was not sufficient. The affidavit in this case did not allege sufficient facts to trigger the judge\u0027s duty to remove himself under Section 21, and therefore Judge Landis properly heard the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42028,"name":"Seymour Stedman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/seymour_stedman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stedman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"seymour_stedman"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21494"},{"advocate":{"ID":26776,"name":"Henry F.
