I am not going. If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.\" A federal statute makes it a crime to \"knowingly and willfully\" threaten the life of the President. Watts was arrested, tried, and convicted in federal court for violating this statute. Watts argued the statement \"did not constitute a \u0027threat\u0027 within the language of the statute.\" On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected this argument, finding that the statement violated the statute even if Watts had no intention of carrying out his threat, and affirmed the lower court\u0027s judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Watt\u0027s statement a legitimate threat within the meaning of the statute?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a per curiam opinion, the Court concluded, without hearing arguments, that Watts\u0027 statement was \"political hyperbole\".

Aberdeen \u0026amp; Rockfish Railroad Company and several other railroad companies (Southern lines) operated within the “Southern territory.\" Beginning on July 17, 1947, the Northern lines tried to obtain new divisions of the freight rates that applied between the Official territory and Southern territory from the Interstate Commerce Commission. These proposed divisions would be based on actual, relative costs of service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commission determined that the existing divisions violated the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), which directed the Commission to set aside inequitable divisions of joint rates and to prescribe equitable divisions. In determining the relative costs that controlled the divisional formula, the Commission frequently relied on unadjusted average costs incurred by the railroads on the average of all traffic in their territories, and not on actual costs incurred by the Northern and Southern lines. The Commission found that the existing divisions violated the ICA because they allocated a lesser share of revenues to the Northern lines based on relative costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Administrative Procedure Act required that courts set aside agency findings that are unsupported by substantial evidence. On appeal from the Commission’s decision, the district court set aside the Commission’s decision. It held that the Northern lines failed to prove that the Commission relied on substantial evidence about the relative costs of handling north-south freight traffic, noting that the burden of proof lay with the Northern lines. It also rejected the Commission’s finding that the divisions required adjustment due to the greater revenue needs of the Northern lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court properly set aside the Commission’s order because it was not based on substantial evidence or reasoned findings related to the allegedly higher average costs of handling freight traffic for the Northern lines?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous decision written by Justice William O. Douglas, the Court held that the district court properly set aside the Commission’s ruling due to a lack of substantial evidence. Justice Douglas argued that deferring to the Commission’s decision -- despite the lack of solid evidence on record regarding North-South traffic -- would in effect give final deference to the Commission’s expertise and allow no room for review. He explored the Commission’s findings of fact, questioning the Commission’s seemingly contradictory conclusions about the effect of suburban passenger operations on freight service costs. Justice Douglas rejected the petitioners’ argument that these costs must be considered to keep railroads solvent because the present question was about costs, not revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Douglas acknowledged that the Northern lines generally return more empty shuttle boxcars per year than the Southern lines, and that Detroit requires shipments of 800,000 carloads of automobile parts each year. He pointed, however, to the Commission’s failure to clearly connect the costs associated with returning empty cars with this higher volume of traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22627,"name":"Edward A.

In the performance of this duty, the Office of the Secretary of the Interior contracted Universal Interpretive Shuttle Corp (UISC) to provide guided tours of the National Mall on minibuses that visitors may board and disembark at various sites. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission (WMATC) sued to enjoin UISC from conducting tours without obtaining a certificate of convenience and necessity from the WMATC. The district court dismissed the suit, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed without opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Secretary of the Interior retain exclusive rights to contract services for national parks?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion for the 6-2 majority. The Supreme Court held that Congress granted sole authority over contracts for services at national parks to the Secretary of the Interior. Any alternative interpretation of the statute would require a dual authority scheme that has no evidence of congressional intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissent, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the Supreme Court should not interfere in matters of local law in the District of Columbia. He argued that this case did not present a constitutional issue but rather an issue of local law that should not have been reviewed by the Supreme Court.

The Housing Authority gave no reason for the eviction.  When Thorpe attempted to learn the reason, her requests went unanswered.  The Housing Authority of the City of Durham obtained a court order to force Thorpe’s eviction.  Thorpe argued that she was evicted because of her activity with the Parents Club, in violation of her First Amendment rights, but the state appeals court and the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed the eviction.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the case was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a circular which stated that all evicted tenants should be informed of the reason for their eviction.  The U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case to the Supreme Court of North Carolina for a ruling in accordance with the circular.  The North Carolina court refused to apply the circular on the ground that it was to be applied prospectively.  Throughout these proceedings, Thorpe remained in her apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a tenant in a federally assisted housing project be evicted without notification of the reason when the Department of Housing and Urban development implemented such a procedure after the eviction had been initiated?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the unanimous majority, holding that the Housing Authority must follow the HUD circular procedure in Thorpe’s eviction.  Since Thorpe had not physically been evicted from her apartment, the court saw no distinction between eviction proceedings that began after the circular was issued and Thorpe’s case.  The Court also decided that the circular was mandatory, not advisory, and it was not an unconstitutional impairment of the Housing Authorities lease agreement.  Justice Hugo L. Black wrote a special concurrence stating that because the Housing Authority admitted to following the circular nothing needed to be decided other than that the circular applied in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32207,"name":"James M.

A jury found him not guilty of larceny but guilty of burglary. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. He won his appeal on the grounds that the grand jury that indicted him and the petit jury that convicted him were selected unconstitutionally. The case was remanded and Benton chose to confront a new grand jury. It indicted him for larceny and burglary; the petit jury found him guilty of both charges. Benton then appealed arguing that that re-indicting him on the larceny charge after he had been acquitted amounted to double jeopardy. The Maryland Supreme Court affirmed, following the U.S. Supreme Court\u0027s \u003ci\u003ePalko\u003c/i\u003e decision, which held that the double-jeopardy clause did not apply to state court criminal proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Benton\u0027s second indictment, trial, and conviction for larceny violate the Fifth Amendment provision against double jeopardy?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court -- in a 7-2 decision -- overruled \u003ci\u003ePalko\u003c/i\u003e, holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states is an element of liberty protected by Due Process of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result, Benton\u0027s larceny conviction was overturned. Justice Thurgood Marshall authored the majority opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35669,"name":"M.

They decided to wear black armbands throughout the holiday season and to fast on December 16 and New Year\u0027s Eve. The principals of the Des Moines school learned of the plan and met on December 14 to create a policy that stated that any student wearing an armband would be asked to remove it, with refusal to do so resulting in suspension. On December 16, Mary Beth Tinker and Christopher Eckhardt wore their armbands to school and were sent home. The following day, John Tinker did the same with the same result. The students did not return to school until after New Year\u0027s Day, the planned end of the protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough their parents, the students sued the school district for violating the students\u0027 right of expression and sought an injunction to prevent the school district from disciplining the students. The district court dismissed the case and held that the school district\u0027s actions were reasonable to uphold school discipline. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the decision without opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a prohibition against the wearing of armbands in public school, as a form of symbolic protest, violate the students\u0027 freedom of speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Abe Fortas delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Supreme Court held that the armbands represented pure speech that is entirely separate from the actions or conduct of those participating in it. The Court also held that the students did not lose their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech when they stepped onto school property. In order to justify the suppression of speech, the school officials must be able to prove that the conduct in question would \"materially and substantially interfere\" with the operation of the school. In this case, the school district\u0027s actions evidently stemmed from a fear of possible disruption rather than any actual interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that children are not necessarily guaranteed the full extent of First Amendment rights. Justice Byron R. White wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he noted that the majority\u0027s opinion relies on a distinction between communication through words and communication through action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the First Amendment does not provide the right to express any opinion at any time. Because the appearance of the armbands distracted students from their work, they detracted from the ability of the school officials to perform their duties, so the school district was well within its rights to discipline the students. In his separate dissent, Justice John M. Harlan argued that school officials should be afforded wide authority to maintain order unless their actions can be proven to stem from a motivation other than a legitimate school interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15012,"title":"Oral Argument - November 12, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15012"}],"citation":{"volume":"393","page":"503","year":"1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26447"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Union School District No. 15 applied these restrictions. On April 25, 1965, Morris H. Kramer, a resident of district 15 who resided with his parents and had no children, attempted to register for the local school district elections. His application was rejected for failure to comply with the restrictions. Kramer filed a class-action suit against the school board in federal court, claiming his constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated. The district court initially declined to hear his constitutional claims, but, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit directed the district court to hear Kramer\u0027s claim. On hearing the complaint, the court found no constitutional violation and denied Kramer\u0027s claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the requirement that he be a landowner or parent of a student to vote in school district elections violate Kramer\u0027s rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-3 decision authored by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court accepted Kramer\u0027s argument that all district residents share substantial interest in school meeting decisions. While the statute purported to limit voting rights to those who were \"primarily interested\" in the election\u0027s outcome, the Court found the structure of the law too broad to achieve this goal. The Court concluded that such restrictions must be tailored to achieve the stated goal, and the current classifications \"permit inclusion of many persons who have, at best, a remote and indirect interest in school affairs and, on the other hand, exclude others who have a distinct and direct interest in the school meeting decisions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15097,"title":"Oral Argument - January 16, 1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15097"}],"citation":{"volume":"395","page":"621","year":"1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26456"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Congress made foreign aid funds available to bring commodities to the Republic of Korea, beginning with the Mutual Security Act of 1954.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1961, the Concentrated Phosphate Export Association (CPEA) organized to act as an export-selling agency for the concentrated phosphate products of its member corporations. CPEA organized under the Webb-Pomerene Act, which Congress passed to help American firms compete with foreign cartels. The process began when Congress allocated funds to various Agency for International Development (AID) programs. The United States thus directly financed the purchase of commodities allocated to Korea, approved via a complicated, tightly regulated application procedure. The United States assigned two of the CPEA contracts, and the Republic of Korea assigned the other nine, subject to detailed regulation by AID. The contracts only circulated in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States filed an action to enjoin price fixing and business allocation activities among the CPEA’s five major member corporations. The district court held that CPEA’s sales were ‘export trade’ for the purposes of the Sherman Act; hence, although CPEA conceded that its members were coordinating their sales actions, CPEA did not violate the Sherman Act. On January 1, 1967, the State Department amended its regulations to preclude Webb-Pomerene associations from bidding on contracts where the procurement was limited to United States suppliers; in response, the CPEA dissolved on December 28, 1967, despite the district court’s favorable ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is the case moot because the CPEA dissolved and joint operations were no longer economically viable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the CPEA fall under the Webb-Pomerene Act’s ‘export trade’ exemption because it is engaged in selling goods procured under the government’s foreign aid program?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for a 7-2 majority, held that the case was not moot. Although CPEA itself was no longer in operation in that form, the government sought injunctive relief against each of its individual members as well. Justice Marshall also noted that the new AID regulations did not apply to all contracts that the former members of CPEA might bid on. Moreover, the Court could not simply rely on the appellees’ statement that joint operations would no longer be economically advantageous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Marshall also held that the CPEA did not fall within the Webb-Pomerene Act’s ‘export trade’ exemption. He looked to the legislative history of the Act, noting that the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and the Act’s two main sponsors specified that the Webb-Pomerene Act was not intended to injure American consumers. Hence, Congress did not mean its exemption to insulate transactions initiated, controlled, and financed by the American government. Justice Marshall rejected the CPEA’s argument that they competed for contracts with foreign suppliers, noting that the governing statute required a preference for American procurement and that none of the major trading nations were allowed to compete for contracts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White dissented, joined by Justice Potter Stewart. He argued that the goods sold by the CPEA were exported from the United States in any ordinary sense of the word ‘export’. He noted that AID regulations referred to receiving countries as ‘importers’ and to the transactions as ‘exports’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan took no part in the decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44339,"name":"Warren Christopher","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/warren_christopher","view_count":0,"last_name":"Christopher","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"warren_christopher"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22023"},{"advocate":{"ID":41731,"name":"Samuel W.

In his majority opinion, Justice Marshall noted that the rights to receive information and to personal privacy were fundamental to a free society.

Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men\u0027s minds.\" The Court distinguished between the mere private possession of obscene materials and the production and distribution of such materials.

The district courts found that the Voting Rights Act did not apply to the voting changes in the four cases and dismissed the complaints. The voters and candidates filed direct appeals, and the cases were consolidated.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. May a private litigant bring a suit to determine whether a voting change falls under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. If so, should these private litigants bring their suits in their local districts (even though certain suits under the Act must be brought in the District of Columbia)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Did Congress intend for these suits to be heard before three-judge district courts with direct appeals to the Supreme Court?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Did the statutory and rules changes involved deal with \"a voting qualification or prerequisite for voting, or standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting\" within the meaning of section 5?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, Yes, Yes. And Yes. The Supreme Court held that § 5 authorized a private right of action based on the remedial aims of the Voting Rights Act. The Court also interpreted the Act to provide that litigants bring these suits in their local district courts, and that three-judge district courts be convened (as was true at that time in constitutional challenges).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the substantive issue in the case, Chief Justice Earl Warren explained that the Voting Rights Act was \"aimed at the subtle, as well as the obvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right to vote because of their race.\" Therefore, the Court concluded that Congress intended that \"all changes, no matter how small, be subjected to §5 scrutiny.\" The judgments were reversed, and all four cases were remanded to the district courts with instructions to issue injunctions restraining further enforcement of the enactments until such time as the states adequately demonstrated compliance with the approval requirements of the Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Marshall Harlan II, concurring in part and dissenting in part, argued that the language of § 5 referred only to laws by which voters registered to vote and had their ballots counted, and he therefore agreed that several of the disputed voting changes at issue were covered by the Act but disagreed as to several others. Justice Hugo Black dissented on the ground that § 5, in his view, is unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14852,"title":"Oral Argument - October 16, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14852"},{"id":14953,"title":"Oral Argument - October 15, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14953"}],"citation":{"volume":"393","page":"544","year":"1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26466"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Plaintiffs contended that the officials violated Plaintiffs\u0027 First Amendment right to free speech by threatening enforcement of the statutes for the sole purpose of harassing and intimidating Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs filed the case in United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. A three-judge court upheld all of the statutes except for one subsection that prohibited \"the assembly of 2 or more persons to do an unlawful act\" and one subsection a statute that prohibited intimidating a person by threats to commit any criminal offense. The court enjoined the officials from enforcing these two subsections. Defendants appealed the decision as to the intimidation statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an Illinois statute prohibiting the use of intimidation to commit a criminal offense violate freedom of speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-1 decision, Justice Hugo L. Black delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court held that Plaintiffs were not in danger of any irreparable injury from threatened use of the statute in question. The plaintiffs had never been arrested, prosecuted, or charged under the statute in question. Furthermore, the complaint did not mention any specific threats made by Defendant. It looked as though Plaintiffs had searched state statutes and city ordinances in order to pick out the ones that police could potentially use in bad-faith prosecutions. Justice Black held that it is not proper to block state criminal prosecutions based on speculation about the future. Justice Byron White and Justice Thurgood Marshall concurred in the result. Justice William O. Douglas dissented, saying that although the plaintiffs had not been prosecuted under the statute, officials were using it to harass the plaintiffs, causing irreparable injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15240,"title":"Oral Argument - March 24, 1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15240"},{"id":15304,"title":"Oral Reargument - April 29, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15304"},{"id":15308,"title":"Oral Reargument - November 16, 1970","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15308"}],"citation":{"volume":"401","page":"77","year":"1971","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26482"},"decisions":[{"description":"The allegations fell far short of showing any irreparable injury from threats or actual prosecutions under the intimidation statute","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

He held a position with the New York City Transit Authority and had no prior criminal record. On June 6, 1966, Street was in his Brooklyn apartment listening to the radio when he heard a news announcement that civil rights activist James Meredith had been shot by a sniper during his march through Mississippi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreet went to a bureau drawer and removed an old 48-star American flag. He carried the flag to the intersection of Lafayette Avenue and St. James Place, one block from his residence. He laid a piece of paper on the sidewalk. Then, keeping the flag properly folded, he set it on fire with a match. He held the burning flag in hand as long as he could, then laid it on the paper so that it would not touch the sidewalk. When a police officer arrived, he found Street standing over the burning flag and talking to a small group of people. Street admitted that he burned the flag. The officer later testified that he heard Street shout, \"If they did that to Meredith, we don\u0027t need an American flag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New York City Criminal Court charged Street with malicious mischief for willfully and unlawfully defiling, casting contempt upon, and burning an American flag. The allegation included Street\u0027s words at the scene of the flag burning. At trial, Street moved to dismiss the information on the grounds that Street engaged in a constitutionally protected act because the flag burning was a form of protest protected by the First Amendment. The court dismissed this motion; Street was convicted and given a suspended sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed Street\u0027s conviction without opinion. The New York Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed, holding that the flag burning was an act of incitement fraught with danger to the public peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn a trial for flag burning, was there sufficient evidence in the record to show that Street was not convicted for constitutionally protected speech when the allegation contained his statement, \"If they did that to Meredith, we don\u0027t need an American flag\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice John Harlan, the Court held that the record lacked sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the trial court constitutionally convicted Street of flag burning. Justice Harlan first held that Street properly raised the issue of the constitutionality of the allegation\u0027s reference to Street\u0027s words. He applied the rule in \u003cem\u003eStromberg v. California\u003c/em\u003e, where the Court held that a conviction must be set aside if it could have been based on constitutionally protected speech; here, Justice Harlan could not determine from the record that Street\u0027s words were not an independent cause of his conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan rejected the Court of Appeals\u0027 characterization of the flag burning as an act of incitement, holding instead that Street\u0027s conviction furthered no government interest. He declined to rule on the broader issue of the constitutionality of New York\u0027s flag burning statute. The Court reversed and remanded Street\u0027s case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren dissented. He rejected the majority\u0027s characterization of the allegation against Street, noting that New York made no attempt to prove that the crowd heard Street\u0027s words. He argued that Street was convicted for his act, not his words, and that the state only introduced evidence of his words to show his intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo Black dissented. He agreed with the Court of Appeals that Street\u0027s conviction rested entirely on the act of burning an American flag, and that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not bar the states from prohibiting this act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White dissented. He rejected both the majority\u0027s assumption that Street could have been convicted for speech alone and its proposition that the entire conviction must be reversed if the speech conviction was unconstitutional. He regarded the allegation as one that provided several means for conviction, and reasoned that there was sufficient evidence of Street\u0027s unlawful act on record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abraham Fortas dissented. He focused on the unique legal history of the American flag, noting the peculiar obligations and restrictions wrapped up with ownership of an American flag.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14891,"title":"Oral Argument - October 21, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14891"}],"citation":{"volume":"394","page":"576","year":"1969","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26505"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

He was convicted and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  Kaufman then filed a post-conviction motion in district court challenging the evidence that proved his sanity.  He alleged that the evidence was unlawfully seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The district court denied relief, holding that unlawful search and seizure was not an available attack in post-conviction proceedings.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a federal prisoner challenge unlawfully-seized evidence in a post-conviction proceeding?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice William J. Brennan, writing for a 5-3 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that Kaufman could challenge unlawfully seized evidence in a post-conviction proceeding.  There was no need to show special circumstances.  The fact that Kaufman admitted to the crime was irrelevant because he claimed an affirmative defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black dissented, arguing that prisoners can only challenge evidence post-conviction in special circumstances.  The prisoner should have to cast some shadow of doubt on his guilt.  Justice John M. Harlan wrote a separate dissent, writing that Kaufman did not show special circumstances, so should not be allowed to challenge the evidence post conviction.

Both the American Independent Party and the Socialist Labor Party sought ballot access in Ohio for the 1968 presidential election. The American Independent Party, formed by supporters of George C. Wallace, obtained the requisite number of signatures but failed to file its petition for ballot access prior to the February 7, 1968 deadline. The Socialist Labor Party, which until 1948 had been on the ballot, failed to collect enough signatures and was also kept off the ballot. The parties filed separate suits in U.S. District Court against several state officials, including Governor James A. Rhodes, contending that being kept off the ballot violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The cases were consolidated, and the court ruled that each party must be given write-in access but did not require the state to print the parties\u0027 candidates\u0027 names on the ballot. The American Independent Party requested and was granted an injunction forcing the state to add the party\u0027s candidates to the ballot while the case was on appeal. The Socialist Labor Party filed a similar request, but did so much later, and was denied primarily to avoid confusion in requiring the reprinting of another set of ballots.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Ohio violate the parties\u0027 equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by refusing to print their candidates\u0027 names on the ballot?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Hugo L. Black, the Court found that Ohio failed to show a compelling interest in limiting the parties\u0027 ballot access. The Court concluded that Ohio\u0027s restrictions gave the two major parties a \"total monopoly\" and imposed a significant, unequal burden on minority groups. Given this fact, and the particular importance of the right to vote, Ohio\u0027s arguments that its restrictive policies maintained an orderly process and ensured an electoral victor would have at least 50% of the vote failed to meet the necessary standard of a compelling state interest. The Court struck down the Ohio restrictions and granted the American Independent Party full ballot access. To avoid confusion and a last-minute reorganization of the ballot, however, it denied the Socialist Labor Party such access for the 1968 election, in accordance with the injunctive order.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14863,"title":"Oral Argument - October 07, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14863"}],"citation":{"volume":"393","page":"23","year":"1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26511"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

During the rally, members of the organization made racist and derogatory speeches amplified over a public address system. Officials of Princess Anne and Somerset County obtained a restraining order to prevent the organization from reconvening the next day. The order was \u003cem\u003eex parte\u003c/em\u003e, so no notice was given to the organization. The order restrained the organization from holding rallies in the county for 10 days. At trial, the Circuit Court issued an injunction for another 10 months. On appeal the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed the 10 day order, but reversed the 10 month injunction because the period of time was unreasonable and arbitrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the case moot because the restraining order had already expired? Was the restraining order an improper prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Yes. In a unanimous decision, Justice Abe Fortas wrote the majority opinion. The Supreme Court held that the case was not moot because the 10-day order still plays a role in the white supremacist organization\u0027s continued efforts in the county. The order was set aside because there was no notice given to the organization and they were not given the opportunity to participate in the adversary proceeding. The Court did note that there may be a case where \u003cem\u003eex parte\u003c/em\u003e orders are allowed when one party can show that the other is unavailable or impossible to serve.

He was provided with court-appointed counsel and pled guilty on all five counts. The judge did not ask Boykin whether he entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily, nor does the record show that Boykin was aware of his rights to trial by jury and to confront his accusers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePursuant to Alabama law, a jury trial determined Boykin’s punishment. Boykin did not testify and offered no evidence regarding his character. There was no evidence of a prior criminal record. The jury sentenced the petitioner to death on all five counts. The Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed the death sentence, but three justices dissented on the grounds that the record did not show the petitioner entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the trial court commit a reversible error when it failed to confirm that the petitioner’s plea was voluntary and that he was aware of his rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the 6-2 majority. The Court held that a guilty plea is a confession, and the admissibility of a confession is contingent on the confirmation that it was made voluntarily. The waiver of several constitutional rights is involved in a guilty plea. A defendant’s silence is insufficient to show that he understood these rights and chose to waive them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that the Court wrongly and inconsistently followed a precedent that subjects state courts to a federal rule of evidence concerning guilty pleas; and that this rule has no basis in the Constitution. He also argued that the question was irrelevant, because the petitioner never claimed that his plea was made unknowingly or involuntarily. Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22365,"name":"E.

Alabama election officials denied the NDPA request under the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act. The NDPA then brought suit in a special three-judge U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama claiming constitutional violations. NDPA lost and appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the Court heard arguments on October 18 in support of a temporary restraining order which it had granted on October 14.

The local churches withdrew from the general church due to these conflicting views. In response, the general church took over the local churches’ property. Each of the local churches sued the general church for trespass on the disputed property. The general church argued that the civil courts don\u0027t have the power to determine whether the general church had departed from its faith and practice. The district court disagreed and concluded that, under Georgia law, the implied trust of local church property for the benefit of the general church was terminated because of the general church’s substantial departure from its doctrines. The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the judgment, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the decision by agreeing with the general church that the First Amendment prevents civil courts from ruling on church doctrine issues. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the civil courts have the ability to determine title to church property on the basis of the civil court’s interpretation of the church doctrine?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The court held that civil courts do not have the authority to award property on the basis of the interpretation and significance that the civil courts have assigned to aspects of the church doctrine. Therefore, the Court held that the Georgia courts have violated the First Amendment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M.

The Court reasoned that searches \"incident to arrest\" are limited to the area within the immediate control of the suspect. While police could reasonably search and seize evidence on or around the arrestee\u0027s person, they were prohibited from rummaging through the entire house without a search warrant.

Epperson, a public school teacher, sued, claiming the law violated her First Amendment right to free speech as well as the Establishment Clause. The State Chancery Court ruled that it violated her free speech rights; the State Supreme Court reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a law forbidding the teaching of evolution violate either the free speech rights of teachers or the Establishment clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Seven members of the Court held that the statute violated the Establishment clause. Writing for the Court, Justice Abe Fortas stated that the law had been based solely on the beliefs of fundamentalist Christians, who felt that evolutionary theories directly contradicted the biblical account of Creation. This use of state power to prohibit the teaching of material objectionable to a particular sect ammounted to an unconstitutional Establishment of religion. Justice Fortas wrote, \"The State\u0027s undoubted right to prescribe the curriculum for its public schools does not carry with it the right to prohibit, on pain of criminal penalty, the teaching of a scientific theory or doctrine where that prohibition is based upon reasons that violate the First Amendment.\" The two other members of the Court concurred in the result, writing that it violated either the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment (because it was unconstitutionally vague) or the Free Speech clause of the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15345,"title":"Oral Argument - October 16, 1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15345"}],"citation":{"volume":"393","page":"97","year":"1968","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/26566"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

William Johnson and Jonathan Klosek (husband of Julia Klosek) were employed by Nacirema Operating Company as longshoremen and Albert Avery was employed by Old Dominion Stevedoring Company. Johnson and Avery were injured and Klosek was killed during separate accidents that occurred while on the dock unloading a ship. The Deputy Commissioners of the United States Department of Labor denied claims by the men and their families under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Compensation Act (the Act) because the injuries did not occur “upon the navigable waters of the United States” as required under the Act. The district court upheld those decisions and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre injuries to longshoremen that occur on piers permanently affixed to shore compensable under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 5-3 majority, reversed the Fourth Circuit. The Act’s language determines coverage by the location of the injury, navigable waters, rather than rather than an individual’s status as a longshoreman performing maritime contracts. While the Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act extends admiralty tort jurisdiction to ship related injuries on a pier, it does not extend the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented, arguing that the Act was status oriented and covered all injuries sustained by longshoremen in the course of their employment. Justice Hugo L. Black and Justice William J.

The doctrine is composed of two primary requirements concerning personal attacks in the context of public issue debates and political editorializing. The FCC conditioned its renewal of broadcast licenses on compliance with its regulations. Red Lion Broadcasting challenged the application of the fairness doctrine with respect to a particular broadcast. In a companion case (United States v. Radio Television News Directors Association (RTNDA)), the fairness doctrine\u0027s requirements concerning any broadcast were challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the FCC\u0027s fairness doctrine regulations, concerning personal attacks made in the context of public issue debates and political editorializing, violate the First Amendment\u0027s freedom of speech guarantees?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, the Court held that the fairness doctrine was consistent with the First Amendment. Writing for the Court, Justice White argued that spectrum scarcity made it \"idle to posit an unabridgeable First Amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak, write, or publish.\" The Court held that the FCC\u0027s fairness doctrine regulations enhanced rather than infringed the freedoms of speech protected under the First Amendment. With respect to the regulation of personal attacks made in the context of public issue debates, the FCC\u0027s requirement that the subject of the attack be provided with a tape, transcript, or broadcast summary, as well as an opportunity to respond without having to prove an inability to pay for the \"air-time,\" insured a balanced and open discussion of contested issues. The requirement that political editorializing be presented for and against both sides of the debated issues also contributed to the balanced discussion of public concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15704,"name":"Archibald Cox","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/archibald_cox","view_count":0,"last_name":"Cox","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"archibald_cox"},"advocate_description":"for the respondents in US v.
