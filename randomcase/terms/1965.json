The mortgage securing the loan referred to Texas law. When the Yazzel\u0027s defaulted on the loan, the U.S. Government sued to collect the balance due. Mrs. Yazzel moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Texas law of coverture meant the contract was not enforceable against her personally. Under the law of coverture, a woman\u0027s legal rights are subsumed by her husband upon marriage. The Government argued that federal law, which would not recognize coverture, applied because there was an overwhelming federal interest. The district court granted summary judgment and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Federal or local Texas law apply to the loan?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eTexas law. In a 6-3 decision, Justice Abe Fortas wrote for the majority holding that there was no overwhelming federal interest. The Government had voluntarily negotiated the contract knowing of the references to Texas law. The Court also noted there was no federal law, regulation, or contractual provision that allowed for application of federal law in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a special concurrence stating that Texas law applied whether the contract referred to Texas law or not because the state interest in family property arrangement was greater than the federal interest. Justice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent stating that federal law should apply because the loan was from the federal government and is, therefore, a federal matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15376,"title":"Oral Argument - October 13, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15376"}],"citation":{"volume":"382","page":"341","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25776"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15099,"name":"Earl Warren","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/earl_warren","view_count":0,"last_name":"Warren","roles":[{"id":2743,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-512503200,"date_end":-16570800,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

Kent Jr., a 16-year-old boy, was detained and interrogated by the police in connection with several incidents involving robbery and rape. After Kent admitted some involvement, the juvenile court waived its jurisdiction. This allowed Kent to be tried as an adult. Kent was indicted in district court. Kent moved to dismiss the indictment because the juvenile court did not conduct a \"full investigation\" before waiving jurisdiction, as required by the Juvenile Court Act. A jury found Kent guilty and sentenced him to serve 30-90 years in prison. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, although it noted that the juvenile court judge provided no reason for the waiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the juvenile court\u0027s waiver of jurisdiction valid?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision, Justice Abe Fortas wrote for the majority. The Supreme Court determined there was not a sufficient investigation prior to the juvenile court waiver of jurisdiction. Kent did not receive a hearing, access to counsel, or access to his record prior to the waiver. The Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the waiver was proper. Because Kent was 21 years old at the time of this decision, the juvenile court no longer had jurisdiction if the waiver was proper. In light of this, the Court ordered that the conviction be vacated if the waiver was improper and sustained if proper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent stating he would vacate the judgment and remand the case for reconsideration in light of two recent decisions by the court of appeals. Justice Hugo L. Black, Justice John M. Harlan, and Justice Byron R.

John Deere Co. was a suit for the infringement of a patent that consisted of a combination of old mechanical elements for a device designed to absorb shock from plow shanks in rocky soil in order to prevent damage to the plow. In 1955, the Fifth Circuit held the patent valid, ruling that a combination is patentable when it produces an \"old result in a cheaper and otherwise more advantageous way.\" Subsequently, the Eighth Circuit held that, since there was no new result in the combination, the patent was invalid. The parties in Calmar, Inc. v. Cook Chemical Co. (No. 37) and Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. Cook Chemical Co. (No. 43) sought a declaration of invalidity and noninfringement of a patent on finger-operated sprayers with a \"hold-down\" cap issued to Cook Chemical. The District Court and the Court of Appeals sustained the patent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Patent Act of 1952 codify the judicial test of obviousness, adding it to the statutory requirements of novelty and utility for the patentability of an invention? Did the Act change the general level required for the patentability of an invention?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. In an opinion delivered by Justice Tom C. Clark, the Court held that the Patent Act of 1952 did not lower the standards required for the patentability of an invention by adding an inquiry into obviousness to the statutory requirements of novelty and utility. The Court found that section 103 of the 1952 Patent Act Congress added the statutory nonobvious subject matter requirement, the determination of which is made after establishing the scope and content of prior art, the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue, and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art. The Court concluded that the patents do not meet the test of the \"nonobvious\" nature of the \"subject matter sought to be patented\" to a person having ordinary skill in the pertinent art and were therefore invalid. This affirmed the decision in Graham v. John Deere Co. and reversed the other two.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15238,"title":"Oral Argument - October 14, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15238"},{"id":23649,"title":"Oral Argument - October 14, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/23649"}],"citation":{"volume":"383","page":"1","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25782"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Agents gained entrance to the grounds, smelled the distinctive odor of ground mash indicating the presence of a still, and visually confirmed the presence of a column still in building 9A. The federal agents then applied for a warrant, after noting that the Treasury Department had not registered the still in question. The warrant was granted on October 11th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn October 13th, federal agents entered building 9A by force after demanding entry and hearing no reply. They discovered an operating still inside, and found Frank Romano and John Ottiano standing nearby. Ottiano had the key to the facility on his person. Romano stated that he had been at the site for four days and claimed not to know how long the operation had existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSection 5601(b)(1) of the Excise Tax Technical Changes Act of 1958 (\"ETTCA\"), established a presumption of guilt for anyone shown to be at the place or site of an unregistered still. Section 5601(b)(1) was an amendment to Section 5601(a)(1), which defines the crime of possessing an unregistered still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States charged Romano and Ottiano with three counts: possession of an illegal still, the illegal production of distilled spirits, and conspiracy to produce distilled spirits. Judge T. Emmet Clarie instructed the jury with a verbatim reading of the relevant provisions of the ETTCA. The jury found both men guilty of all counts. The court sentenced Romano and Ottiano to concurrent sentences on all three counts and fined them for possession of the unregistered still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Judge J. Edward Lumbard of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, reversed the sentences for possession and illegal production of spirits. He held that the trial court\u0027s application of Section 5601(b)(1) was an unconstitutional violation of Romano and Ottiano\u0027s Fifth Amendment due process rights. He reasoned that the inference of possession did not necessarily follow from a defendant\u0027s presence, given that the defendant could be a purchaser of the product or simply a visitor to the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Romano and Ottiano\u0027s presence at the illegal operation in and of itself justify their convictions for possession? If jury instruction was invalid, is that sufficient to invalidate the charges for possession?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and yes. Writing for a unanimous court with three concurrences, Justice Byron White held that the jury could not simply infer possession from Romano and Ottiano\u0027s presence at the still. Romano and Ottiano\u0027s presence near the still created a rebuttable presumption; hence, the jury was improperly instructed that presence \u003cem\u003enecessarily\u003c/em\u003e required a finding of guilt. Justice White rejected the government\u0027s argument that the amendment signified Congress\u0027 intention to overrule Section 5601(a)(1), effectively equating presence with possession. He found no evidence of this intention in the legislative history and noted that the government presented no cases where possession of a substance was proven solely by a defendant\u0027s presence near that substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court did not rule on Romano and Ottiano\u0027s charge for production of distilled spirits because its sentence was concurrent with the conspiracy charge, which was not at issue. Justice Hugo Black concurred. Referring to his dissent in \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Gainey\u003c/em\u003e, he held that the statute itself was an unconstitutional violation of Romano and Ottiano\u0027s Fifth Amendment right to due process, right against self-incrimination, and Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury because the statute compels defendants to testify in order to rebut a presumption of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas also concurred. He referred to his own dissent in \u003cem\u003eGainey\u003c/em\u003e, where he interpreted Section 5601(b)(1) as a description of a rule of evidence allowing but not mandating a jury to infer possession from a defendant\u0027s presence near an unregistered still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abraham Fortas concurred without comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14937,"title":"Oral Argument - October 14, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14937"}],"citation":{"volume":"382","page":"136","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25806"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

After nineteen hours, the family was released unharmed. The convicts were later apprehended in a violent clash with police during which two of them were killed. In 1953, Joseph Hays\u0027 published a novel based on the Hill family\u0027s ordeal. When the novel was subsequently made into a play, Life Magazine (\"Life\") printed an article about the play that mirrored many of its inaccuracies concerning the Hill family\u0027s experience. Alleging that it deliberately misrepresented his story, Hill sought damages against Life. On appeal from an adverse ruling, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court remanded for a new trial where a reduced adverse ruling was imposed on Life.

In a 6-to-3 opinion, the Court set aside the Appellate ruling against Time because the lower court failed to instruct the jury that Time\u0027s liability was contingent upon a showing that it knowingly and recklessly published false statements about the Hill family. The Court explained that absent a finding of such malicious intent on the part of a publisher, press statements are protected under the First Amendment even if they are otherwise false or inaccurate. The Court remanded for retrial under the new jury instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27621,"name":"Harold R.

Dennis were indicted on federal narcotics charges in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The men pleaded guilty and were sentenced, but the court vacated the convictions based on an unrelated Seventh Circuit decision that held that an indictment that does not allege the drug purchasers name is invalid. A few months later Ewell and Dennis were rearrested and reindicted on new complaints. The complaints contained the same allegations from the original indictment, but named the drug purchasers. Ewell and Dennis moved to dismiss, arguing that their Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial and their Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy were violated. The district court rejected the double jeopardy argument, but granted dismissal based on the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Sixth Amendment’s right to a speedy trial require dismissal of the new indictments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White, writing for a 7-2 majority, reversed. The Supreme Court held that the new indictment was not barred by the Sixth or Fifth Amendment. The right to speedy trial depends on the circumstances of the case. The Court also held that Ewell and Dennis were not prejudiced by the new indictments. Justice William J. Brennan concurred in the result, but expressed his disapproval at the government’s actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abe Fortas dissented, arguing that due process prevents the government from indicting an individual after vacation of that individual’s conviction arising out of the same transaction.

The gasoline was commercially valuable and was discharged into the St. Johns River because a dockside shut-off valve had been accidentally left open. Standard Oil moved for dismissal by arguing that the word “refuse” meant “rejected matter,” which the accidentally discharged gasoline was not. The district court agreed and granted dismissal. The United States appealed directly to the Supreme Court. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Rivers and Harbors Act prohibiting the discharge of “any refuse matter of any kind or description” into navigable waters cover commercially valuable aviation gasoline?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William O. Douglas delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the statute was meant to prevent pollution, and therefore must be read in a broader sense. The effect of the oil on the waterway is the same whether it was useable or not, so it should be treated the same way under the statute. The Court also held that there was legislative precedent for not creating a distinction between valuable and valueless substances deposited in waterways. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a dissent where he argued that the determination of whether or not the statute should encompass all pollutants is a decision for Congress, not the courts. He argued that the majority’s opinion misconstrued the wording of the statute, which, based on legislative history, was meant to refer to obstructions to navigation rather than pollution. He further argued that when there is doubt as to the exact meaning of a statute, the courts should err on the side of a narrow reading. Justice Hugo L. Black and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37177,"name":"Nathan Lewin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/nathan_lewin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Lewin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"nathan_lewin"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21752"},{"advocate":{"ID":22495,"name":"Earl B.

The Court sustained this order in \u003ci\u003eCommunist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board\u003c/i\u003e. On May 31, 1962, the Attorney General separately required William Albertson and Roscoe Quincy Proctor, as alleged members of the Communist Party, to fill out two registration forms each. Neither registration form was specifically mandated by the SACA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbertson and Proctor did not provide personal information required by the forms, instead asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination before the board and denying that the Communist Party was a Communist-action organization. The Attorney General presented the testimony of paid Federal Bureau of Investigation informers that Albertson and Proctor participated in meetings of the Party and had been elected to Party offices. The board took official note of the proceedings and issued a final order stipulating that petitioners had not properly registered as members of the Communist Party. On appeal, the court held that Albertson and Proctor’s claims of privilege were premature in part because they had not yet been prosecuted for a criminal activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the member registration requirements of the Subversive Activities Control Act violate Albertson\u0027s and Proctor’s Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice William Brennan, the Court held both that the petitioners’ claim of self-incrimination was ripe for decision and that SACA’s registration requirement for individuals violated the Fifth Amendment. Justice Brennan noted that SACA clearly implied a duty to file registration, in this case the specific form crafted by the Attorney General. He rejected the government’s argument that individuals could choose to incompletely fill out the form, asserting privilege as to some of the questions but not others. Justice Brennan reasoned that such a possibility might be constitutionally adequate if the registration was neutral on its face, but here Albertson and Proctor would be admitting to an element of a crime. Justice Brennan also rejected the government’s assertion that SACA’s immunity provision protected Albertson and Proctor from self-incrimination. He noted that SACA only provided that registration shall not constitute per se evidence of criminal guilt; thus, registration could still be used as evidence of guilt. The Court reversed the lower court’s decision and set aside the Board’s orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron White concurred. He noted his previous objection to SACA’s registration provisions while serving as Attorney General. Justice White previously cautioned that SACA likely violated individuals’ freedom of speech, of assembly, and the privilege against self-incrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":28815,"name":"John J.

The article questioned the ways that Baer, and the County Commissioners to whom he reported, failed to develop the Area to its full potential. A jury in New Hampshire Superior Court awarded Baer damages. In the time between the outcome of the trial and Rosenblatt’s appeal, the Supreme Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan, where it held that a state cannot award damages to a public official for a defamatory falsehood unless the official proves that there was actual malice—knowledge that the statement was false or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statement. The New Hampshire Supreme affirmed the award and found that New York Times v. Sullivan had no impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a government official have to prove that defamatory statements were made in actual malice to succeed in a libel action?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 8-0 majority. The Court held that there must be evidence that the libelous statements are directed specifically at the public official in question, and not the governmental body in general. Since the trial judge permitted the jury to award damages based on the finding that Baer was one member of a governmental organization that was libeled, the Court held that the jury instructions were erroneous, and the judgment should be overturned. The Court also held that the public official must establish the statements were made with actual malice, according to the definition set out in New York Times v. Sullivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark concurred in the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas concurred and argued that the term “public official” is not one that appears in the Constitution and therefore does not need to be as narrowly defined as the Court makes it. He also argued that the First Amendment should bar Congress from enacting any federal libel laws, so the discussion should be surrounding public issues rather than public officials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurrence, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that the Constitution prevents state defamation laws from being converted into laws against seditious libel. He argued that the ruling protects a private individual’s reputation while upholding a high standard of proof for a public official’s defamation suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Black concurred in part and dissented in part. He argued that the First Amendment protects speech that is critical of the government and argued that the majority’s opinion in both New York Times v. Sullivan and this case did not go far enough in protecting that right. Justice William O. Douglas joined in the partial concurrence and partial dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice John M. Harlan argued that the majority opinion’s rule that the jury cannot convert “impersonal” libel to “personal” libel misconstrues tort law. Under conventional tort law, there may be recovery if the group is specific enough to be understood to apply to a specific individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abe Fortas wrote a jurisdictional dissent and argued that certiorari was improvidently granted. He wrote that, because the original trial and decision occurred before the Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan, that ruling should have no effect on this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16640,"name":"Arthur H.

Section 5(b) of the Clayton Act halted the running of the statute of limitations on pending claims arising from the act. It also specified a four-year statute of limitations for these causes of action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn September 28, 1956, Marc D Leh brought an action against General Petroleum Corportation and five other petroleum manufacturers alleging injury to his business caused by a conspiracy or combination to exclude Leh from engaging in wholesale distribution of gasoline in Southern California. He alleged that this conspiracy began in 1948; all parties agreed that Leh\u0027s right to initiate a cause of action began in February of 1954. Leh anticipated a statute of limitations problem under California law, as California\u0027s Code of Civil Procedure specified a one-year statute of limitations for penal causes of action, in contrast to the Clayton Act\u0027s four-year limit. Hence, Leh cited to \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Standard Oil\u003c/em\u003e, in which the United States alleged a conspiracy to control prices among a nearly identical set of defendants and successfully applied the Clayton Act\u0027s longer limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistrict court Judge William Mathes ruled in favor of General Petroleum, holding that the tripling of damages was a penalty, and was thus barred by the statute of limitations under California law. The court also held that the Clayton Act did not apply to the claim --distinguishing on the facts from \u003cem\u003eStandard Oil\u003c/em\u003e -- primarily because Leh did not allege that the defendants combined to control prices, did not name the same set of defendants, and did not allege a similar period of conspiracy. Judge Stanley Barnes of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, affirmed. Judge Barnes affirmed the lower court\u0027s interpretation of California law, and that the application of the Clayton Act used in \u003cem\u003eStandard Oil\u003c/em\u003e did not apply here because the facts were not similar enough to justify collateral estoppel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Leh\u0027s claim similar enough to that made by the government in \u003cem\u003eStandard Oil\u003c/em\u003e to justify his use of collateral estoppel? Was Leh\u0027s claim valid because the Clayton Act suspended the running of the statute of limitations?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. Justice Thomas White, writing for a unanimous Court, held that Leh is not required to allege equivalent means, objectives and conspiracy to rely on \u003cem\u003eStandard Oil\u003c/em\u003e. Relying on the Court\u0027s 1965 decision in \u003cem\u003eMinnesota Mining \u0026amp; Mfg. Co. v. New Jersey Wood Finishing Co.\u003c/em\u003e, Justice White emphasized giving effect to the broad terms of the Clayton Act and Congress\u0027 belief that antitrust litigation is one of the surest weapons for effective enforcement of antitrust laws. He noted that six of the seven defendants were named in both Leh\u0027s claim and the United States\u0027 in \u003cem\u003eStandard Oil\u003c/em\u003e, and that the United States similarly alleged an intention to eliminate the competition of independent refiners. Thus, Leh\u0027s pending case halted the tolling of the statute of limitations under the Clayton Act, and his claim was still valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices John Harlan and Abraham Fortas took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15086,"title":"Oral Argument - October 11, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15086"}],"citation":{"volume":"382","page":"54","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25842"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Blacks were not allowed to enter any of the branch libraries. The bookmobiles were segregated: a red one served only whites and a blue one served blacks. Brown was a black man who entered a library branch with four other blacks and requested a book, The Story of the Negro. The librarian informed Brown that the book was not available, but that she would request it through the state library, and he could pick it up or have it mailed to him. After the conversation, the men sat down (making no noise or disturbance) and refused to leave. They were arrested \"for not leaving a public building when asked to do so by an officer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the actions of the arresting officer infringe upon Brown\u0027s (and his companions\u0027) freedom of speech, assembly, and freedom to petition the Government for redress of grievances as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe divided Court found that the actions of the police violated the Constitution. Justice Fortas argued that states may only regulate the use of public facilities in a \"reasonably nondiscriminatory manner, equally applicable to all.\" Maintaining separate library facilities clearly violated this principle. Fortas also reasoned that the demonstration did not disturb the peace of other library patrons or disrupt the library\u0027s activities; the time and method of the sit-in were carefully chosen and executed. Justice Black dissented, joined by three other justices. He argued that the First Amendment \"does not guarantee to any person the right to use someone else\u0027s property, even that owned by government and dedicated to other purposes, as a stage to express dissident ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15533,"title":"Oral Argument - December 06, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15533"}],"citation":{"volume":"383","page":"131","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25845"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Ginzburg challenged his conviction as unconstitutional since the circulars themselves were not obscene. On appeal from an adverse ruling by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding an unfavorable lower court finding, the Supreme Court granted Ginzburg certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes conviction under the federal obscenity statute, for pandering advertisements for sexually explicit publications, violate of the First Amendment\u0027s free speech protections if the advertisements are not themselves obscene?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that although circulars themselves may not be obscene, their public mailing offends the federal obscenity statute if they advertise obscene materials. The Court reasoned that where the sole emphasis of an advertisement is the commercial exploitation of erotica for prurient appeal, it shall be deemed \"pornographic\" communication that lies beyond the scope of First Amendment speech protections. The Court cautioned, however, that the distribution of materials containing sexuality in the context of art, literature, or science is not per se prohibited under the obscenity statute if it can be shown to advance human knowledge or understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15134,"title":"Oral Argument - December 07, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15134"}],"citation":{"volume":"383","page":"463","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25848"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

She filed suit, alleging the poll tax deprived indigent Virginia residents of their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The federal district court dismissed her claim, based in part on a 1937 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that had ruled poll taxes to be within the powers of the states. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Virginia poll tax violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6–3 decision authored by Justice William Douglas, the Court held the poll tax violated the Equal Protection Clause. Overruling its own precedent in \u003cem\u003eBreedlove v. Suttles\u003c/em\u003e (1937), the majority reasoned that the eligibility to vote has no rational connection to the wealth of an individual. Thus, the poll tax could not meet the heightened standard of review applied to restrictions on voting, which is a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is important to note that there was no textual basis for this stark reversal, since the Twenty-fourth Amendment applied only to federal elections. This was an example of a situation in which the changing membership of the Court and changing attitudes in society propelled a change in the law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Marshall Harlan II dissented, arguing that the poll tax did pass the rational basis test. Harlan found that the state had a legitimate interest in collecting revenue. He felt that it was reasonable to think that people who were willing to pay to vote would have a greater interest in directing the course of state policy. According to Harlan, this type of classification was no less rational than the literacy test that the Court had upheld in \u003cem\u003eLassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections\u003c/em\u003e (1959). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo Black also dissented, arguing for a stricter adherence to precedent and the text of the Fourteenth Amendment. He articulated a more traditional understanding of the Constitution as susceptible to extension only by the legislative process. \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15271,"title":"Oral Argument - January 25, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15271"},{"id":15274,"title":"Oral Argument - January 26, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15274"}],"citation":{"volume":"383","page":"663","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25862"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

On January 12, 1960, the police raided the basement below a printing shop belonging to Norman Levenberg. The police discovered, through Levenberg, that a number of books were kept for Edward Mishkin in a storage room. Also that day, officers entered Midget Book Shop, where they seized an additional number of books and magazines. On February 10, 1960, the police confiscated three books from the Main Stern Book Store. Levenberg later testified that Mishkin controlled all of the books, and that he operated both the Publishers’ Outlet and the Main Stern Book Store; officers indeed encountered Mishkin at both stores. In all, the police seized fifty books allegedly possessed by Mishkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seized books were paper-bound “pulps,” and most had jackets with illustrations relating to the fictional subject matter within. The covers of nineteen of the books displayed illustrations of women being whipped, beaten, tortured or abused. Most of the book jackets depicted symbols associated with fetishism, such as leather boots, excessively tight clothing, black gloves, whips, masks and corsets. Some presented incidents of sexual seduction, transvestism, sodomy, rape and masturbation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state of New York charged Mishkin with multiple counts of  possessing obscene books, of hiring others to prepare obscene books, and of publishing obscene books. At trial, authors who worked under Mishkin for several years testified that he instructed them to fill the books with strong sexual material. Mishkin was convicted before a three-judge panel of the Court of Special Sessions. He was sentenced to a three-year prison term and ordered to pay $12,000 in fines. The appellate court affirmed Mishkin’s sentence, modifying the judgment to remove charges related to Mishkin’s failure to print the name and address of the publisher or printer on the books; the court held the statute requiring this action to be unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals of New York affirmed the judgment, holding that the New York law forbidding obscene material itself did not violate Mishkin’s constitutional rights and was not unconstitutionally vague.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWas New York’s anti-obscenity statute impermissibly vague?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWere Mishkin’s books properly found to be obscene?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMust the government show that Mishkin knew the books were obscene?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes, and yes. The Court upheld Mishkin’s conviction, in a 6-3 decision written by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. Justice Brennan rejected Mishkin’s argument that the New York statute’s use of the terms “sadistic” and “masochistic” was impermissibly vague, because the state’s definition was narrower than used by the Court in \u003ci\u003eRoth v. United States\u003c/i\u003e. The Court also rejected Mishkin’s argument that the material did not meet the Roth test’s prurient-appeal requirement in that it did not appeal to the prurient interests of the average person. The Court held that the Roth test is satisfied if the dominant theme of material appeals to the prurient interests of members of a sexual subgroup. It pointed to evidence that Mishkin instructed the books to be specifically conceived and marketed to appeal to “sexually deviant groups”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court also rejected Mishkin’s argument that there was insufficient proof that he knew the material was obscene. The Court noted Mishkin’s instructions to his artists and writers, his efforts to disguise his role in the enterprise by publishing the books anonymously, and the sheer volume of material. According to the Court, this evidence showed Mishkin was aware of the character of the material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo Black dissented, arguing that the Court and lower federal courts are without power to censor obscene material regardless of its subject matter. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart dissented, arguing that the material in question was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented, in a combined response to the majorities of \u003ci\u003eMishkin\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eGinzburg v. United States\u003c/i\u003e. He referenced testimony at trial indicating that several of the books in question have redeeming social value. He also questioned New York\u0027s right to limit publishers\u0027 ability to cater to nonconformist groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23029,"name":"Emanuel Redfield","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/emanuel_redfield","view_count":0,"last_name":"Redfield","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"emanuel_redfield"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22064"},{"advocate":{"ID":28282,"name":"H.

Sheppard, who maintained his innocence of the crime, alleged that the trial judge failed to protect him from the massive, widespread, and prejudicial publicity that attended his prosecution. On appeal from an Ohio district court ruling supporting his claim, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. When Sheppard appealed again, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhat threshold must be crossed before a trial is said to be so prejudicial, due to context and publicity, as to interfere with a defendant\u0027s Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an 8-to-1 decision the Court found that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial. Noting that although freedom of expression should be given great latitude, the Court held that it must not be so broad as to divert the trial away from its primary purpose: adjudicating both criminal and civil matters in an objective, calm, and solemn courtroom setting. The Cleveland television media\u0027s repeated broadcasts of Sheppard confessing in detail to crimes he was later charged with, the blatant and hostile trial coverage by Cleveland\u0027s radio and print media, and the physical arrangement of the courtroom itself - which facilitated collaboration between the prosecution and present media - all combined to so inflame the jurors\u0027 minds against Sheppard as to deny him a fair trial. The Court concluded that the trial judge should have either postponed the proceedings or transferred them to a different venue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14833,"title":"Oral Argument - February 28, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14833"}],"citation":{"volume":"384","page":"333","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25865"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

At about 10:30 A.M., Byars observed a group of four to six people including noted activist Fred L. Shuttlesworth walking toward the intersection of 19th Street and Second Avenue, the location of the front entrance of Newberry’s Department Store. Byars walked through Newberry’s and through the front entrance, where he observed a group of ten or twelve people congregated in one area. They were standing and talking with Shuttlesworth apparently at the center of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByars observed the group for a minute or so from inside Newberry’s, then left the store and told the group to move on and clear the sidewalk. Some of the group began to leave. Byars repeated his command, and Shuttlesworth asked, “You mean to say we can’t stand here on the sidewalk?” Three more officers arrived on the scene, and Byars told the group that they would have to clear the sidewalk or he would arrest them for obstructing its use. By this point, only Shuttlesworth remained at the scene. Shuttlesworth repeated his question, and Byars told him he was under arrest. Shuttlesworth then attempted to walk into Newberry’s, but Byars followed him in and arrested him. Shuttlesworth offered no resistence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn April 5, Shuttlesworth was tried in the recorder’s court of the city of Birmingham. The court charged him with obstructing free passage on the sidewalk and with refusing to comply with a police order to move on in violation of two sections of the Birmingham General City Code. He was sentenced to 180 days of hard labor and $100 fine and costs. He appealed for a trial de novo in the district court. Byars’ initially testified that the group’s presence impeded pedestrian traffic, but on cross-examination he testified that the group only blocked off about half the sidewalk. The court affirmed Shuttlesworth’s conviction, rejecting his assertions that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that the prosecution’s case was not supported by evidence, and that Shuttleworth’s conduct was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed Shuttlesworth’s conviction, holding the evidence sufficient to support the verdict. The Alabama Supreme Court denied Shuttlesworth’s applications for \u003ci\u003ecertiorari\u003c/i\u003e and rehearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is an ordinance making it an offense to stand, loiter or walk on any city sidewalk in a way that obstructs others’ free passage over that sidewalk unconstitutional as applied to Shuttlesworth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Is an ordinance making it an offense to stand or loiter on a city sidewalk after a request by a policeman to “move on” unconstitutional as applied to Shuttlesworth?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Potter Stewart held that while both portions of the statute were facially constitutional, the trial court unconstitutionally applied the “obstructing free passage” portion of the ordinance. Justice Stewart noted that in \u003ci\u003ePhifer v. City of Birmingham\u003c/i\u003e, the Alabama Court of Appeals later interpreted the statute to apply only when a person who obstructs free passage on a sidewalk also refuses to obey a request by an officer to move on. The trial court did not have this interpretation available to it, and it made no findings of fact and rendered no opinion. Justice Stewart inferred from this that the trial court may have applied an unconstitutionally literal interpretation of the statute, where either obstructing free passage on the sidewalk or disobeying a police order to move on would be sufficient for a finding of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stewart also held that the trial court unconstitutionally applied the \"move on\" portion of the ordinance to Shuttlesworth. Justice Stewart again referred to \u003ci\u003ePhifer\u003c/i\u003e, where the Court held that the police order in question must be related to directing vehicular traffic because that section of the Birmingham General City Code was related to regulating vehicular traffic. In contrast, the record for Shuttlesworth’s case did not contain any evidence that Patrolman Byars was directing vehicular traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas concurred. He reasoned that Shuttlesworth could not have been blocking traffic when he was arrested because all other members of his group had left by that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Abraham Fortas also concurred, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Justice Fortas would have finally reversed the conviction. While agreeing that the statute is constitutional on its face, he argued that there was no way the facts could be construed to show that Shuttlesworth and his group were actually obstructing the sidewalk. He accused Birmingham of using the statute as a pretext to lock up a notorious civil rights activist.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32207,"name":"James M.

They filed false affidavits between 1949 and 1955 to satisfy the stipulations of 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act, which required all union officers to submit non-Communist affidavits. The union officials retained their Communist Party affiliations, filed the affidavits, and enabled the union to use the services of the National Labor Relations Board. The union officers were indicted by the United States District Court for conspiracy to fraudulently obtain the services of the National Labor Relations Board.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes the indictment charge a conspiracy to defraud the United States Government consistent with 18 U.S.C. 371? 2. Is section 9(h) of the Taft- Hartley Act a bill of attainder in violation of Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution? 3. Did the trial court err in denying the defense\u0027s request for access to grand jury testimony of prosecution witnesses or in camera inspection of the testimony?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, not addressed, and yes. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that the indictment properly charged a conspiracy to defraud the United States Government under 18 U.S.C. 371. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Abe Fortas, argued that the conspiracy of filing the false affidavits was intentional and that the events of filing the affidavits and using the NLRB facilities together were a \"concert of action\" with the purpose of defrauding the Government. The Court refused to hear the question of the constitutionality of 9(h) as the union officers\u0027 attempt was to circumvent the law. The relevant standard, according to Fortas, is that the Court will not hear a constitutionality claim to supplant a \"voluntary, deliberate, and calculated course of fraud and deceit,\" as conspiracy to defraud is not an appropriate way to challenge acts of government. The Court also held that the defense should have been allowed access to the grand jury minutes containing the prosecution witnesses\u0027 testimonies with an opportunity to question the witnesses regarding their statements. The majority opinion maintained that the union officers exceeded the particularized need standard that is used to evaluate access to grand jury testimony, and thus access should have been granted to the defense, especially as an evaluation is best made by a defense advocate and not a trial judge during in-camera inspection. Justices William O. Douglas and Hugo L. Black joined this part of the majority opinion but dissented from the remainder. The Court reversed the district court\u0027s judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43387,"name":"Telford Taylor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/telford_taylor","view_count":0,"last_name":"Taylor","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"telford_taylor"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23154"},{"advocate":{"ID":37177,"name":"Nathan Lewin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/nathan_lewin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Lewin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"nathan_lewin"},"advocate_description":"For the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/23155"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15303,"title":"Oral Argument - April 20, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15303"}],"citation":{"volume":"384","page":"855","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25868"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

That night, Price released all three men from custody, and then drove his police cruiser to intercept them on Mississippi Highway 19. Price accosted the three men, placed them in his police car, and then drove them down an unpaved road. There Price and seventeen other men, including both local citizens and members of the Philadelphia, Mississippi Police Department, executed the three men and dumped their bodies in a construction site. All eighteen defendants were subsequently arrested and were indicted by a Grand Jury on January 15, 1965 for violating federal statutes. The first statute, 18 U.S.C.S. 241, dealt with criminal conspiracies. The second statute, 18 U.S.C.S. 242, criminalized anyone acting under the color of law from depriving any of the rights, privileges, or immunities guaranteed by the Constitution. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi dismissed the charges for violating 18 U.S.C.S. 242 against the non-police officer defendants, claiming that the indictment did not state an actual offense against the United States. This appeal followed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Price and the other defendants violate federal law when they murdered three men on June 21, 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous decision, Justice Abe Fortas reinstated the indictment against all defendants. First, Justice Fortas addressed 18 U.S. C.S. 242 as applied to the non-police officers. Here, he noted that private citizens can act under the color of law where they are joining state officials in engaging in prohibited actions, as they did in this case. Therefore, the “color of law” indictments should be reinstated against all of the defendants, not merely the police officers. Next, Justice Fortas addressed the alleged violation of 18 U.S.C.S. 241, the criminal conspiracy statute. Here, Justice Fortas stated that a criminal conspiracy, perpetrated in part by state officials, constitutes a state action and therefore falls under the United States’ authority granted by the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Fortas then addressed the history of this statute, and the Fourteenth Amendment. To him, this history, including the civil war, racial violence, Klu Klux Klan, and voter intimidation, solidified his conclusion that the conspiracy statute was designed to be read against the backdrop of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Hugo L. Black concurred in this decision, noting some disagreement with the majority’s use of the case of United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 58; United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70; and Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 70. This case also inspired the 1988 film, \u003cem\u003eMississippi Burning\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15104,"name":"Thurgood Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thurgood_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","roles":[{"id":2748,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-71002800,"date_end":686293200,"appointing_president":"Lyndon B.

Harris and the grand jury went before the District Court for the Southern District of New York where the judge told Harris he would receive immunity from prosecution that might arise from his statements. Harris again refused to answer, citing privilege. The judge then held Harris guilty of criminal contempt committed in the court\u0027s presence under rule 42(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Harris guilty of criminal contempt under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(a)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision, Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority and held that Harris\u0027 conduct did not rise to the level of contempt covered under 42(a). The rule is reserved for acts such as threatening the judge or disrupting a hearing. The Court also felt the \"real contempt\" occurred before the grand jury, not the district court. Because Harris\u0027 conduct was not covered, he should be given notice of and a separate hearing for criminal contempt as provided by Rule 42(b). With this decision the court overruled \u003cem\u003eBrown v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, 359 U.S. 41 (1959). Justice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent stating that the issue was resolved in \u003cem\u003eBrown\u003c/em\u003e and there is no reason to overrule that decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":14982,"title":"Oral Argument - October 11, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/14982"},{"id":15185,"title":"Oral Argument - October 12, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15185"}],"citation":{"volume":"382","page":"162","year":"1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25886"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

He intended the land to be used as a park that only whites could access. The city, as the named trustee, created a board of managers to operate the park, and it eventually allowed African Americans to use it. Trying to effectuate the Senator\u0027s will, individual managers of the park sued to remove the city as trustee because it was constitutionally unable to enforce the racially restrictive component of the will. After the city complied and resigned as trustee, private trustees appointed by a state court resumed excluding African Americans. A group of African Americans then brought an action on the grounds that the racial exclusion still violated equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The state courts upheld the appointment of the private trustees. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen private actors fulfill public or governmental duties, are they subject to constitutional restrictions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA private park operator is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment if the park is municipal in character. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting for the 6-3 majority, Justice William O. Douglas held that racial discrimination is prohibited under the Fourteenth Amendment in any state-sponsored situation. In this situation, the city maintained and managed the park, which had become an integral part of the city. This makes the operation of the park a public function, despite the fact that it was managed by private trustees. A park provides municipal services, such as mass recreation, so equal protection should apply. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Byron R. White wrote that the city’s resignation was based on the false understanding that the city cannot enforce the dictates of the trust but that the private trustees can. Since racial discrimination regarding the use of public property is unconstitutional, the private trustees could not enforce the will any more than the city could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the Court unnecessarily overstepped its bounds by hearing a case that should be decided solely according to interpretation of state law by the state courts. Since there is no constitutional reason to prevent a municipality from resigning a trusteeship, the issue is one for the states to decide individually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissenting opinion, Justice John M. Harlan argued that the Court should have dismissed the writ of certiorari because the case had no federal implications. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30616,"name":"Jack Greenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_greenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_greenberg"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21830"},{"advocate":{"ID":19309,"name":"C.

Col. Lemuel Penn was shot and killed by three members of the Ku Klux Klan while driving home from Washington, D.C. The alleged shooters, James Lackey, Cecil Myers, and Howard Sims, were indicted but acquitted by an all-white jury. Following the acquittal, the three defendants were indicted on charges of conspiracy to threaten, abuse, and kill African Americans. Three alleged co-conspirators, Denver Phillips, George Turner, and Herbert Guest, were also charged. The U.S. Code defines criminal conspiracy as two or more individuals conspiring to \"injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\" The indictment filed against the six alleged conspirators accused them of acting to deny African Americans full and equal enjoyment and utilization of goods and services, including access to state highways and free travel to and from Georgia on public streets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that it did not allege a specific denial of rights under U.S. law. The district court agreed, and dismissed the indictment. The prosecution appealed, arguing that the indictment alleged, in part, a denial of rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the federal indictment based on an offense under the laws of the United States?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIf a state participates at all in a conspiracy it has violated the Fourteenth Amendment with regard to any individuals whose rights are infringed, based on the constitutional right to travel. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an 8-1 opinion authored by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court held that a criminal conspiracy affecting an individual\u0027s right of free interstate passage violated the law. The Court reasoned that the indictment contained an express allegation of state involvement sufficient at least to require denial of a motion to dismiss. If the predominate purpose of the conspiracy is to prevent the exercise of the right of travel, or to oppress a person of that right, as was the case here, then whether or not motivated by racial discrimination, the conspiracy becomes a proper object of federal law under which the indictment was brought. Therefore, the federal indictment was based on an offense under the laws of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clark, joined by Justices Black and Fortas, concurred.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harlan dissented in part and concurred in part.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Brannan, joined by Justices Warrant and Douglas, dissented in part and concurred in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15131,"title":"Oral Argument - November 09, 1965","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15131"}],"citation":{"volume":"383","page":"745","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25894"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

While in negotiations for a new collecting bargaining agreement, several Hanna marine engineers expressed that they no longer wanted their union to represent them. Negotiations broke down, and the union picketed one of Hanna\u0027s ships. This made it impossible for workers to unload the ship. Hanna petitioned the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to stop the picketing. The NLRB dismissed the petition because the engineers were \"supervisors\" as defined by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and could therefore not be \"employees.\" The NLRA does not protect supervisors. Hanna then filed charges with the NLRB under the NLRA, alleging that the union induced a work stoppage through improper secondary pressure and engaged in improper organizational picketing. The NLRB dismissed the charges because the NLRA did not apply to unions that represent supervisors, and the union\u0027s conduct did not exceed the bounds of lawful picketing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna sybsequently filed suit in the Wisconsin Circuit Court for Douglas County, requesting injunctive relief against further picketing and against any attempts by the union to force representation on Hanna\u0027s engineers. The Circuit Court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the decision because that while the picketing was illegal under Wisconsin State law, it arguably violated the NLRA and so fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the NLRA preempt the state\u0027s authority to enjoin a marine engineer union\u0027s picketing where the marine engineers are defined as supervisors and not employees?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 9-0 decision Justice John M. Harlan wrote for the majority. While a state may not regulate conduct arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA, the Supreme Court found that Hanna\u0027s engineers were supervisors, not employees, and were not covered under the Act. The NLRA did not preempt Wisconsin\u0027s authority in this situation.

The written confession was admitted into evidence at trial despite the objection of the defense attorney and the fact that the police officers admitted that they had not advised Miranda of his right to have an attorney present during the interrogation. The jury found Miranda guilty. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed and held that Miranda’s constitutional rights were not violated because he did not specifically request counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination extend to the police interrogation of a suspect?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Fifth Amendment requires that law enforcement officials advise suspects of their right to remain silent and to obtain an attorney during interrogations while in police custody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority, concluding that defendant’s interrogation violated the Fifth Amendment. To protect the privilege, the Court reasoned, procedural safeguards were required. A defendant was required to be warned before questioning that he had the right to remain silent, and that anything he said can be used against him in a court of law. A defendant was required to be told that he had the right to an attorney, and if he could not afford an attorney, one was to be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desired. After these warnings were given, a defendant could knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. Evidence obtained as a result of interrogation was not to be used against a defendant at trial unless the prosecution demonstrated the warnings were given, and knowingly and intelligently waived. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the majority’s opinion created an unnecessarily strict interpretation of the Fifth Amendment that curtails the ability of the police to effectively execute their duties. He wrote that the state should have the burden to prove that the suspect was aware of his rights during the interrogation, but that statements resulting from interrogation should not be automatically excluded if the suspect was not explicitly informed of his rights. In his separate dissenting opinion, Justice John M. Harlan wrote that the judicial precedent and legislative history surrounding the Fifth Amendment does not support the view that the Fifth Amendment prohibits all pressure on the suspect. He also argued that there was no legal precedent to support the requirement to specifically inform suspects of their rights. Justices Potter Stewart and Byron R. White joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice White wrote a separate dissent in which he argued that the Fifth Amendment only protects defendants from giving self-incriminating testimony if explicitly compelled to do so. He argued that custodial interrogation was not inherently coercive and did not require such a broad interpretation of the protections of the Fifth Amendment. Such an interpretation harms the criminal process by destroying the credibility of confessions. Justices Harlan and Stewart joined in the dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30219,"name":"John J.

That section provided that no person who successfully completed the sixth grade in a school accredited by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the language of instruction was other than English shall be denied the right to vote in any election because of his inability to read or write English. The plaintiffs argued that Section 4(e) prevented the enforcement of New York election laws which required an ability to read and write English as a condition of voting. A three-judge panel of the district court granted declaratory judgment and prevented enforcement of Section 4(e). It held that Congress exceeded its constitutionally designated powers in enacting Section 4(e) and usurped the powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 exceed the scope of Congress\u0027 powers to enact legislation because it infringes on powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court held that Section 4(e) is a proper exercise of the powers granted to Congress. With Justice William J. Brennan writing for the majority, the Court reasoned that Congress exercised its powers consistent with those afforded it by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court then concluded that the Supremacy Clause prevented the enforcement of the New York English literacy requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15555,"title":"Oral Argument - April 18, 1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15555"}],"citation":{"volume":"384","page":"641","year":"1966","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/25921"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.
