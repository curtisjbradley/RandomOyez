Rowoldt admitted to joining the Party for about a year and working at a Communist bookstore. However, he contended that he should not be deported because he joined the Party to \"fight for his daily needs\" and get \"something to eat and something to crawl into.\" The Internal Security Act contained an exception for those who joined the Party to obtain food, employment, or other necessities of living. Rowolt also indicated that he was not aware that anyone in the Party supported violent overthrow of the government. Rowoldt sought a writ of habeas corpus from the District Court for the District of Minnesota, but his writ was denied because there was enough evidence to support his membership in the Party. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u0027s judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Rowoldt a member of the Communist Party within the definition of Internal Security Act of 1950?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision, Felix Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the court, holding that Rowoldt did not have a \"meaningful relationship\" with the Communist Party as required by the Internal Security Act. The record was insufficient to support the order of deportation and the Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision. Justice John Marshall Harlan II dissented stating that he believed the record indicated that Rowoldt joined the Party knowing of its active political nature, regardless of whether he believed in violent overthrow of the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21463,"name":"David Rein","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/david_rein","view_count":0,"last_name":"Rein","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"david_rein"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20962"},{"advocate":{"ID":30227,"name":"Joseph Forer","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/joseph_forer","view_count":0,"last_name":"Forer","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"joseph_forer"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner on reargument","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20963"},{"advocate":{"ID":19265,"name":"Carl H.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the conviction because the district court had denied Shotwell’s motion to suppress evidence of certain disclosures.  Shotwell allegedly made these disclosures in good faith, thinking they would shield them from liability.  After the government petitioned for certiorari, they moved to remand the case to the district court in light of new evidence.

In a 6-3 decision, Justice John M. Harlan wrote for the majority, vacating the court of appeals\u0027 decision and remanding the case to the district court.  The Supreme Court would not review the case with a record challenged as being “tainted with perjury and fraud”.  Because Shotwell, et al. were found guilty, there was no double jeopardy issue.  The district court was the proper venue for the remand because there were questions about the integrity of the record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissent, stating that the Court should have denied certiorari and let the case take its regular course back to the district court for a new trial based on the decision by the court of appeals.

The state of Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission, and the Milwaukee Road Commuters’ Association sued the ICC in district court and sought to enjoin the enforcement of the order. The district court held that the ICC had failed to show that the fares authorized by the state commission caused undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate commerce, and therefore the order was not justified. The ICC appealed the case directly to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court correctly find that the ICC lacked the necessary evidence to support the imposition of the order raising intrastate commerce fares?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Supreme Court held that there must be clear justification for an agency of the federal government to interfere in states’ interests. In this case, the ICC interfered based on a single line of a commuter train system running at a deficit, which does not provide justification to require alteration of the rates throughout the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39873,"name":"R.

By the time Cicenia saw his attorney, he had made and signed a written confession to the murder. Cicenia moved the state trial court for an order requiring the state to produce his written confession. The trial court denied the motion and the state supreme court affirmed the decision. Cicenia commenced a federal habeas corpus proceeding and the lower court discharged the writ, holding that Cicenia had failed to establish the involuntariness of his confession and that the state\u0027s refusal to permit petitioner to communicate with counsel during the inquiry did not deprive him of due process. The appellate court affirmed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the state’s refusal to permit Cicenia to communicate with counsel during the policy interrogation deprive him of due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice John M. Harlan II, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision. The Court reasoned that Cicenia had failed to substantiate the charge that his confession was coerced. The Court also found that Cicenia did not have a constitutional right to confer with counsel during police questioning and, therefore, there was no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. The Court also found that in the absence of a showing of prejudice to Cicenia, it was not a due process violation for the state to deny counsel the opportunity to inspect the confession before trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Douglas, joined by Justices Warren and Black, dissented, arguing that the majority ruling was out of line with the constitutional requirement of fair criminal proceedings against a citizen.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13415,"title":"Oral Argument - April 02, 1958 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13415"},{"id":13426,"title":"Oral Argument - April 02, 1958 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13426"}],"citation":{"volume":"357","page":"504","year":"1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24293"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

For the next fourteen hours, Crooker was sporadically questioned and interrogated in his home and in the West Los Angeles Police Station; he repeatedly asked to meet with an attorney and was told that he could call only after the investigation was over. After fourteen hours of detainment and periodic interrogation, Crooker wrote a full confession to the murder. The next morning, Crooker was asked to orally repeat his confession, but he refused and again asked to speak with an attorney. Crooker was permitted to call his attorney at that point, and from then forward, he was represented by his counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Crooker argued that his confession was obtained in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process because his confession was coerced by state authorities, and even if it was given voluntarily, he was denied the right to counsel. The issue of whether Crooker’s confession was voluntary was presented to the jury, which resolved the question against Crooker and convicted him. The Supreme Court of California affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a confession obtained during an interrogation in which the suspect asked for and was denied access to counsel obtained in violation of the suspect’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Tom C. Clark delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the coercion that might occur from a denial of a specific request for counsel can be negated by factors such as the defendant’s age, intelligence, and education. In this case, Crooker had knowledge of his rights based on the fact that he was a law student and that he refused to answer some questions during interrogation. Additionally, Crooker was informed by the police officer that he didn’t have to answer anything he didn’t want to. Therefore, Crooker’s confession was not coerced. The Court also held that, although Crooker’s confession was made without counsel being present, his awareness of his rights meant that the absence of counsel did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the repeated denial of counsel to Crooker was a violation of his Due Process right. Justice Black also argued that the preservation of Due Process should also be applied to pre-trial investigation and therefore that the accused who wants counsel should have one at any time after the arrest.

Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e. On February 20, 1958, five months after the integration crisis involving the Little Rock Nine, members of the school board (along with the Superintendent of Schools) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, urging suspension of its plan of desegregation. The relief the plaintiffs requested was for the African American children to be returned to segregated schools and for the implementation of the desegregation plan to be postponed for two and a half years. The district court granted the school board\u0027s request, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWere Arkansas officials bound by federal court orders mandating desegregation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a signed, unanimous per curiam opinion, the Court held that the Arkansas officials were bound by federal court orders that rested on the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in \u003cem\u003eBrown v. Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e. While the Court noted that the school board had acted in good faith, that most of the problems stemmed from the official opposition of the Arkansas state government to racial integration in both word and deed, it was constitutionally impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause to maintain law and order by depriving the black students of their equal rights under the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, the Court held that since the Supremacy Clause of Article VI made the U.S. Constitution the supreme law of the land, and \u003cem\u003eMarbury v. Madison\u003c/em\u003e made the Supreme Court the final interpreter of the Constitution, the precedent set forth in \u003cem\u003eBrown v. Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e was the supreme law of the land and was therefore binding on all the states, regardless of any state laws contradicting it. The Court therefore rejected the contention that the Arkansas legislature and Governor were not bound by the \u003cem\u003eBrown\u003c/em\u003e decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Frankfurter wrote a concurring opinion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15571,"title":"Oral Argument - August 28, 1958 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15571"},{"id":15580,"title":"Oral Argument - August 28, 1958 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15580"},{"id":13538,"title":"Oral Argument - September 11, 1958 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13538"},{"id":13495,"title":"Oral Argument - September 11, 1958 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13495"}],"citation":{"volume":"358","page":"1","year":"1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24300"},"decisions":[{"description":"The governor and legislature of Arkansas are bound by federal court orders mandating desegregation.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

As a result of this strike, Mr. Paul Russell, a non-union employee at the plant, was prevented from working when members of the picket line made violent threats against him and physically blocked the only entrance into the plant.  The strike lasted until August 22, 1951.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussell sued the union in Alabama state court, claiming that the union unlawfully invaded his right to engage in a lawful occupation free from unlawful interference.  The Union argued that the Labor Management Act of 1947 removed jurisdiction from the state court to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  When the trial court decided for the union, Russell appealed. The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the lower court’s decision and remanded the case for trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, a jury returned a $10,000.00 verdict for Russell.  The union appealed, arguing that the jury verdict was excessive and reiterating its argument that the state court had no jurisdiction to hear this case.  The Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed the trial court’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does a state court have jurisdiction over an action by a non-union employee against a union and its agent, for malicious interference with the employee’s lawful occupation during a strike?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was the jury’s $10,000.00 verdict excessive?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no.  Justice Harold Burton, writing for a 6-2 majority, reiterated the Supreme Court’s decision in \u003ci\u003eUnited Construction Workers v. Laburnum Corp.\u003c/i\u003e, which held that Congress did not give the National Labor Relations Board exclusive jurisdiction over a common-law tort for damages.  Justice Burton noted that, although the National Labor Relations Board had the authority to award back pay to Russell, that authority did not remove Russell’s right to sue the union for damages in state court.  The Court held that cutting off an employee’s right to sue a union would, in effect, grant unions substantial immunity from any consequences resulting from mass picketing or coercion.  Finally, the Court held that the $10,000.00 verdict was not excessive in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren dissented, stating that, when Congress passed the Labor Management Act, it was attempting to balance the competing interests of employees, unions, and management.  By allowing additional remedies, Justice Warren argued that the Supreme Court upset that balance.  Justice William O. Douglas joined in this dissent.  Justice Hugo Black did not participate in this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30662,"name":"J. R.

The California Constitution requires denial of tax exemption to any person or organization who advocates the overthrow of the U.S. Government or the State of California by violent or unlawful means.  To enforce this, a provision of the CRTC requires those applying for tax exemption to sign an oath declaring that they do not engage in that prohibited activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn both cases, the Los Angeles assessor denied tax exemption because the churches refused to agree to the oath.  The churches paid their taxes under protest and sued the County of Los Angeles for a refund.  The churches argued that requiring them to agree to the oath violated the U.S. Constitution.  In 382, the trial court upheld the oath and the Supreme Court of California affirmed.  In 385, the court upheld the oath under the U.S. Constitution, but held that it violated the California Constitution because it excluded householders from the requirement.  The Supreme Court of California reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the CRTC and California Constitution provisions requiring those applying for tax exemption to agree to an oath promising not to overthrow the government by violent means violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  The Supreme Court reversed the lower court judgments.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., writing for a four justice plurality, followed the same reasoning from his opinion in \u003ci\u003eSpeiser v. Randall\u003c/i\u003e, a companion case.  In that opinion he held that the oath provision denied freedom of speech without due process because it placed the burden of proof of eligibility for tax exemption on the taxpayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black concurred, using his opinion from \u003ci\u003eSpeiser\u003c/i\u003e where he argued that the First Amendment barred California for imposing what he saw as a tax on belief and expression.  Justice William O. Douglas joined in the concurrence.  Justice Douglas concurred separately, following his opinion from \u003ci\u003eSpeiser\u003c/i\u003e, and adding that the oath provision violated the First Amendment freedom of religion.  Justice Black joined in the concurrence.  Justice Harold Burton concurred in the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark dissented, arguing that signing the oath or not does not alone decide tax exempt eligibility, so the burden of proof is not on the tax payer.  Chief Justice Earl Warren did not participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17198,"name":"A. L.

She violated an ordinance in the neighboring town of Baxley, where many of the Manufacturing Co. workers lived.  That ordinance required anyone soliciting members for a union to apply for a permit from the mayor and city council.  The mayor and city council had unlimited discretion to grant or deny the permits for any reason.  Staub argued that the ordinance violated her constitutional right to free speech.  The Court of Appeals of Georgia affirmed the conviction, but did not consider the constitutional question because Staub did not attempt to comply with the ordinance.  The Supreme Court of Georgia denied certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an ordinance requiring union organizers to obtain a permit before recruiting violate free speech?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a 7-2 decision, Justice Charles E. Whittaker wrote the majority opinion reversing the conviction.  The Supreme Court held that the ordinance violated free speech because it made the enjoyment of speech contingent on the will of the mayor and city council.  The mayor and city council had too much discretion in granting or denying permits. Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote a dissent, stating that case should be left to the Georgia Courts.  Justice Tom C.

In addition to informing him that his application refusal rested on his Communist Party affiliations, the Passport Office Director told Kent that in order for a passport to be issued a hearing would be necessary. The Director instructed Kent to submit an affidavit as to whether he was a current or past Communist. Upon the advice of counsel, Kent refused to sign the affidavit but did participate in a hearing at which he was once more asked to sign an affidavit concerning his Communist affiliations. When he refused the affidavit, the Passport Department advised Kent that no further action would be taken on his passport request until he satisfied the affidavit requirement. On appeal from consecutive adverse rulings in both district and appellate court, the Supreme Court granted Kent certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCould the Executive\u0027s Passport Department defer or refuse the issuance of passports to individuals suspected of being Communists or of traveling abroad to further Communist causes?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that the right to travel is an inherent element of \"liberty\" that cannot be denied to American citizens.

Wiener was confirmed as a member of the Commission by President Truman in 1950. In 1953, when President Eisenhower requested Wiener\u0027s resignation, Wiener refused. Eisenhower subsequently appointed a substitute to Wiener\u0027s post.

When he was hurt during his work on power lines, Byrd sued Blue Ridge for negligence in a federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Blue Ridge defended against his claim based on a South Carolina law providing that employees of sub-contractors should be considered employees of contractors for which the sub-contractor provided work. South Carolina law further provided that the immunity defense needed to be determined by a judge rather than a jury. Byrd contended that his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial should trump that provision of the state law. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Byrd’s Seventh Amendment right to jury trial trump South Carolina’s law limiting recovery?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn diversity cases where the Erie doctrine applies, federal courts must balance their respect for the substance of state laws with the need to preserve the essential characteristics and functions of the federal courts. The Seventh Amendment jury function is one of those essential functions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Willian Brennan, the Court held that South Carolina law was essentially a procedural rule because it determined how immunity should be enforced, rather than affecting the substantive rights and obligations created by the state. The federal court should typically follow this type of rule. In the instant case, however, the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial was an essential factor in the federal court process, and therefore the amendment prevailed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13476,"title":"Oral Argument - January 28, 1958 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13476"},{"id":13410,"title":"Oral Argument - January 28, 1958 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13410"},{"id":13390,"title":"Oral Reargument - April 28, 1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13390"},{"id":13463,"title":"Oral Reargument - April 29, 1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13463"}],"citation":{"volume":"356","page":"525","year":"1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24391"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The certificate limited motor operations to service to or from points on the Rock Island Railroad, subject to any restrictions the commission might impose under the Interstate Commerce Act to insure that the service was auxiliary or supplementary to train service. The Act authorized consolidation, merger, acquisition, or lease of common carriers if the commission deemed it to be “consistent with the public interest.” In a separate section, Congress directed the commission not to certify a railroad corporation seeking to operate motor carriers unless it also found that the railroad would use motor vehicle service to public advantage in its operations and would not unduly restrain competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1944, Rock Island purchased the Frederickson Lines, covering routes between Atlantic, Iowa and Omaha, Nebraska. Rock Island filed for permission to provide motor service to points along the Frederickson Lines. The commission granted Rock Island permission, but placed five conditions on motor service for both the White and Frederickson routes. Rock Island challenged the conditions in district court and won, but on appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the commission’s power to impose the conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock Island then filed for permission to provide unrestricted motor service to points along the White and Frederickson lines. In 1954, the application was substantially granted. American Trucking Associations, Inc., nine other motor carriers, a group of railway trade unions, and several other organizations intervened, arguing that 1) the commission was required to limit motor service by a rail-owned motor carrier to auxiliary or supplementary service, and 2) the evidence was not sufficient to support the commission’s certification order. The district court upheld the certificate as granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1. Did the Interstate Commerce Act preclude the Interstate Commerce Commission from issuing a certificate authorizing motor-carrier operations to a subsidiary of Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company because the parent company was a railroad corporation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Was the Interstate Commerce Commission’s conclusion that public interest required the continuation of service by Rock Island Motor Transit Company supported by substantial evidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and yes. In an 8-1 decision written by Justice Thomas Clark, the Court held that the “public interest” section of the Act did not prohibit the commission from allowing Rock Island to operate unrestricted motor service along the White and Frederickson lines. Justice Clark noted that Rock Island applied for its broader application under the public interest section of the Act, which did not contain 1) statutory language limiting the provision of motor service by railroad companies or 2) language suggesting that service must be auxiliary or supplementary. He looked to the legislative history of the act, and determined that while congress considered adding an absolute “auxiliary or supplemental” requirement to the public interest section, it did not do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clark then held that there was sufficient evidence to show that Rock Island’s motor transit service along the approved routes served the public interest. Although the evidence did not suggest that allowing Rock Island to provide motor service was the only way to serve public convenience and necessity, Justice Clark reasoned that the generally more profitable motor service helped to pay for the costlier rail service, securing the public’s access to both. He also noted that the commission could impose restrictions or conditions if Rock Island’s unrestricted motor operations became clearly destructive of competition in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas dissented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37705,"name":"Peter T.

Beilan, a teacher in the Philadelphia school system for the previous 22 years, presented himself in the Superintendent’s office at the latter’s request. The Superintendent asked if Beilan had been the Press Director of the Professional Section of the Communist Political Association in 1944. Beilan requested to speak with counsel before answering, and he was allowed to do so. After speaking with counsel, Beilan informed the Superintendent that he would not answer that question or other similar ones. The Superintendent informed Beilan that refusal to answer such questions could lead to his dismissal. On November 25, 1953, the Board of Public Education initiated dismissal proceedings against Beilan and cited Beilan’s failure to answer the Superintendent’s question regarding his 1944 activities as evidence of “incompetency.” There was a formal hearing, at which Beilan did not testify. The charge of incompetency was sustained and Beilan was fired. The administrative appeal upheld the decision of the local Board. Beilan appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, which set aside Beilan’s discharge. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the removal of a teacher for “incompetency” based on the teacher’s refusal to confirm or deny involvement in various subversive organizations violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harold Burton delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Supreme Court held that public officials such as teachers can be questioned about issues that are relevant to their fitness and suitability for public service. There is no requirement that states that a teacher’s fitness is solely determined by performance in the classroom. By refusing to answer the question, Beilan showed himself to be insubordinate and lacking in frankness, which gave the Board grounds to fire him for incompetency. The Court also held that Beilan was not denied due process because he was given sufficient warning of the consequences of his refusal to answer the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote that it is not a denial of due process when a state appropriately acts in a way that could be seen as unwise. He argued that the Fourteenth Amendment protects against improper state action, and it is not the role of the Supreme Court to censor state action that falls within the bounds of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the Board’s decision to dismiss Beilan was the result of Beilan being called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and therefore invalid. In his separate dissent, Justice William O. Douglas argued that the only evidence against Beilan was his refusal to answer a question regarding his membership in an organization that espouses certain ideals. To punish him without any evidence of wrongdoing runs counter to the entire basis of American jurisprudence. Justice Hugo L. Black joined in the dissent. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. also wrote a separate dissent in which he argued that the state action in this case essentially branded a citizen as disloyal, which could have enormously detrimental effects on his life. Because this charge was not properly addressed by a court of law, Justice Brennan argued that Beilan was denied his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29625,"name":"John Rogers Carroll","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/john_rogers_carroll","view_count":0,"last_name":"Carroll","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"john_rogers_carroll"},"advocate_description":"For the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21711"},{"advocate":{"ID":19955,"name":"C.

The petitioners were indicted and testified before a grand jury without being warned of their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. For this reason, the district court dismissed the indictment.  The appeals court affirmed the dismissal.  While the appeal was pending, the United States initiated a new grand jury proceeding and, at a trial by jury, the petitioners were found guilty.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  The petitioners suspected that prosecutors used privileged information gained in the first indictment to aid in the second proceeding, violating the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court abuse its discretion by denying the petitioners a hearing to determine whether information gathered at the first indictment was used in the second proceeding?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 6-3 decision, Justice Charles E. Whittaker wrote the majority opinion, affirming the convictions.  The Supreme Court rejected the petitioners\u0027 Due Process claims because they laid no foundation for holding a hearing on the issue.  The Court also held that a copy of a cancelled check obtained at the first indictment did not violate Due Process when prosecutors introduced it into evidence at the second proceeding.  The petitioner’s counsel had explicitly waived any objection to that evidence at trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M.

Harlan II, a unanimous Court decided in favor of the petitioners, holding that \"Immunity from state scrutiny of petitioner\u0027s membership lists is here so related to the right of petitioner\u0027s members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in doing so as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Further, the Court held that freedom to associate with organizations dedicated to the \"advancement of beliefs and ideas\" is an inseparable part of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Harlan concluded that the state\u0027s obtaining the names of the Association\u0027s membership would likely interfere with the free association of its members, so the state\u0027s interest in obtaining the records was superseded by the constitutional rights of the petitioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13364,"title":"Oral Argument - January 15, 1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13364"},{"id":13442,"title":"Oral Argument - January 16, 1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13442"}],"citation":{"volume":"357","page":"449","year":"1958","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24448"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.
