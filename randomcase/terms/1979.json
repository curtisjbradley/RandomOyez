Before trial, he moved to suppress incriminating statements he made to police and FBI officers.  The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge for an evidentiary hearing as authorized by the Federal Magistrates Act (FMA).  The Magistrate made findings of fact and recommended dismissal of the motion to suppress.  The district court accepted the recommendation and denied Raddatz’s motion to suppress.  A jury found Raddatz guilty and sentenced him to six months in prison and four and half years of probation.  On appeal, Raddatz argued that the FMA violates Article III of the Constitution, and the district court denied him due process by not personally hearing disputed testimony.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the referral provisions of the FMA do not violate Constitution because the district court makes the final determination.  The court reversed, however, because Raddatz was denied due process when the district court failed to hear the disputed testimony where credibility is crucial to the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the statute allowing the district court to decide a suppression motion based on a record and finding of facts developed by a magistrate judge violate the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  Chief Justice Warren Burger, in a 5-4 decision, wrote the majority opinion reversing the Seventh Circuit.  The Supreme Court held that the FMA did not did not require the district court to independently review disputed testimony.  Also, the FMA did not violate the Constitution.  Justice Harry A. Blackmun concurred, writing that the statute in question does not threaten judicial power or independence in judicial decision making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell wrote a partial dissent, stating that a district court must rehear evidence when credibility is at issue.  Justice Potter Stewart dissented, writing that the FMA clearly requires a district court to rehear evidence when a party objects to a magistrate’s recommendation.  Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.  Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a separate dissent, expressing that use of the the FMA was impermissible in this case under the Fifth Amendment and Article III.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30548,"name":"Joan B.

Beginning in 1976, Congress passed a number of versions of the \"Hyde Amendment\" that severely limited the use of federal funds to reimburse the cost of abortions under the Medicaid program. Cora McRae, a pregnant Medicaid recipient, challenged the Amendment and took action against Patricia R. Harris, Secretary of Health and Human Services.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Hyde Amendment violate the right to privacy, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, or the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court held that states participating in the Medicaid program were not obligated to fund medically necessary abortions under Title XIX. The Court found that a woman\u0027s freedom of choice did not carry with it \"a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices.\" The Court ruled that because the Equal Protection Clause was not a source of substantive rights and because poverty did not qualify as a \"suspect classification,\" the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Fifth Amendment. Finally, the Court held that the coincidence of the funding restrictions of the statute with tenets of the Roman Catholic Church did not constitute an establishment of religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38887,"name":"Rhonda Copelon","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/rhonda_copelon","view_count":0,"last_name":"Copelon","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"rhonda_copelon"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11454"},{"advocate":{"ID":45410,"name":"Wade H.

An acquiring corporation hired Pandick to produce announcements of corporate takeover bids. Although the identities of the acquiring and target corporations were concealed, Chiarella was able to deduce the names of the target companies. Without disclosing his knowledge, Chiarella purchased stock in the target companies and sold the shares immediately after the takeover bids were made public. Chiarella realized slightly more than $30,000 in profits from his trading activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) then investigated Chiarella\u0027s trading activities. Chiarella entered into a consent decree with the SEC in which he agreed to return the profits he made to the sellers of the shares. A few months later, Chiarella was indicted on seventeen counts of violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) and SEC Rule 10b-5. Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act prohibits the use \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security\" of \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe.\" Rule 10b-5, promulgated under Section 10(b), makes it unlawful for any person to \"employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud . . . in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\" Chiarella was convicted at trial and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Chiarella violate Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act by failing to disclose the impending takeover before trading in the target company\u0027s securities?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. A duty to disclose information arises if there is a relationship of trust and confidence between parties to the transaction. Chiarella had no such duty. He was not a corporate insider in the acquiring corporation and he did not receive confidential information from the target company. He also had no fiduciary relationship with the shareholders of the target company: he was not their agent; they placed no trust or confidence in him; indeed, they had no prior dealings with him. A duty to disclose under Section 10(b) does not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42002,"name":"Stephen M.

The mills were granted permits by the California State Water Resources Control Board with variances from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for effluent discharge.  The EPA, however, denied the variances.  The mill companies sought review directly in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.    The Act allows direct appeal of EPA actions either “issuing or denying any permit”.  The court of appeals dismissed the review, holding that because the State granted the permits and the EPA merely objected the variances, this case did not fall under the Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the court of appeals have jurisdiction over the permit review where the State of California was in charge of granting the permit?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case to the court of appeals.  The Supreme Court held that the EPA’s action in denying the variances was effectively the same as denying a permit under the Act.

The passenger, Savchuk, was injured in the crash. In June 1973, Savchuk moved to Minnesota with his parents. He sued Rush in Minnesota district court and attempted to obtain quasi in rem jurisdiction based on the fact that State Farm, the agency that insured Rush’s car, operates in Minnesota. Rush and State Farm moved to dismiss, but the trial court denied the petition and allowed Savchuk to proceed. The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed. Rush appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which vacated the judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration. The Minnesota Supreme Court again found in favor of Savchuk.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a state have jurisdiction over a defendant with no connections in the state by attaching the contractual obligation of an insurer licensed in the state?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that there must be a certain amount of minimum contacts between the defendant and the state in which the suit occurs. The fact that Rush’s insurance company does business in Minnesota is not a sufficient link between him and the state, especially since he owns no property there and has no other connection. Rush had no reason to suspect that having an insurance contract with State Farm would subject him to the possibility of a lawsuit in all states where State Farm does business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that the insurance company could be sued in Minnesota under Rush’s policy. As long as it is understood that the Minnesota court has jurisdiction over the policy and State Farm, rather than the defendant, Justice Stevens argued that the suit could be continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21847,"name":"Edward H.

In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court explained that while natural laws, physical phenomena, abstract ideas, or newly discovered minerals are not patentable, a live artificially-engineered microorganism is. The creation of a bacterium that is not found anywhere in nature, constitutes a patentable \"manufacture\" or \"composition of matter\" under Section 101.

Congress reneged in 1877, passing an act that reclaimed the Black Hills. The Sioux Nation requested compensation in 1920. The United States Court of Claims ruled against the Sioux Nation in 1942. Congress then established the Indian Claims Commission in 1946. The Commission ruled that the Sioux Nation was not barred by the Court of Claims decision and ruled that Congress used its powers of eminent domain in 1877 and the Sioux were therefore entitled to compensation. The Court of Claims maintained that the Sioux were barred by their first case. Congress amended the Indian Claims Commission Act in 1978, removing the judicial bar. The Court of Claims then held that the Sioux were entitled to $17.1 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Was Congress\u0027 1978 amendment a violation of separation of powers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was the reclamation of land in 1877 a taking of property requiring compensation under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and yes. In an 8-1 decision, the Court held that Congress did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers and affirmed the Court of Claims decision. Writing for the majority, Justice Harry A. Blackmun noted a similar situation in \u003cem\u003eNock v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, where a congressional exemption from a judicial bar was ruled not to be in violation of separation of powers and upheld by the Court. Additionally, since Congress \"had not made a good-faith effort to give the Sioux the full value of the Black Hills,\" Congress\u0027 1877 action qualified as use of its eminent domain power under \u003cem\u003eThree Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. United States\u003c/em\u003e. Therefore, the Sioux were entitled to compensation under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Justice Byron R.

On a drive to Arizona, the residents got in a car accident while driving through Oklahoma.  A defective gas tank in the car allegedly caused the accident.  The residents sued the retailer and its New York based wholesale distributor in Oklahoma state court.  The retailer and distributor asserted that Oklahoma could not properly have jurisdiction.  The trial court rejected this claim.  The retailer and distributor then sought a writ of prohibition from the Supreme Court of Oklahoma to prevent the trial court from exercising in personam jurisdiction.  The court denied the writ because jurisdiction was authorized by Oklahoma’s long-arm statute, which allowed jurisdiction over defendants who caused tortious injury within the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a state court exercise in personam jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant in a products liability action where the defendant’s only connection to the state is the accident in question?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-3 decision, Justice Byron R. White wrote the majority opinion reversing the lower court judgment.  The Supreme Court held that a state court could only exercise in personam jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant when that defendant has “minimum contacts” with the state.  In this case, the only contact with Oklahoma was the accident.  The Volkswagen retailer and distributor had taken advantage of none of the benefits of Oklahoma law, had not solicited business in Oklahoma, and did not regularly sell cars that reached Oklahoma directly or indirectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan wrote a dissent expressing the view that the retailer and distributor had purposely entered their goods into the stream of commerce and had gained benefits from other states through the nature of their product.  Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent, stating that a local car retailer makes itself a part of a national network of retailers and can reasonably expect that its product may cause injury in other states.  Justice Harry A.

Permits were only granted to organizations that could demonstrate that 75 percent of their receipts were applied towards \"charitable purposes.\" Citizens for Better Environment, a nonprofit tax-exempt organization, was denied a permit because it did not satisfy the 75-percent requirement. CBE sued in federal district court, which ruled in their favor. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed this ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Schaumburg\u0027s ordinance \"overbroad\" and therefore in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 opinion, the Court held that charitable solicitation is not purely commercial speech and is closely related to forms of protected speech such as advocacy. Justice Byron R. White, who authored the majority opinion, argued that \"it is clear\" that charitable solicitations are protected. While Schaumburg had an interest in preventing fraud, the ordinance did not fully serve that interest, which could be accomplished through alternate means. The ordinance in question also barred legitimate organizations from soliciting contributions. Schaumburg\u0027s interest did not justify the ordinance\u0027s \"interference with protected speech,\",which was therefore unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32994,"name":"Jack M.

Innis was arrested by police in Providence, Rhode Island. Innis was unarmed when arrested. Innis was advised of his Miranda rights and subsequently requested to speak with a lawyer. While escorting Innis to the station in a police car, three officers began discussing the shotgun involved in the robbery. One of the officers commented that there was a school for handicapped children in the area and that if one of the students found the weapon he might injure himself. Innis then interrupted and told the officers to turn the car around so he could show them where the gun was located.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the police \"interrogation\" en route to the station violate Innis\u0027s Miranda rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that the Miranda safeguards came into play \"whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent,\" noting that the term \"interrogation\" under Miranda included \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the subject.\" The Court then found that the officers\u0027 conversation did not qualify as words or actions that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit such a response from Innis.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31805,"name":"John A.

Though addressed to Leggs, Inc., the boxes were mistakenly delivered to the address of L’Eggs Products, Inc. Employees of L’Eggs Products opened the boxes and found the boxes of films, which contained suggestive drawings on one side and descriptions on the other. One of the employees opened one of the boxes of films and unsuccessfully attempted to view portions of the film. The FBI became involved on October 1, 1975 and, without making any effort to obtain a warrant, projected and viewed the films.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn April 6, 1977, William Walter, Arthur Randall Sanders, Jr., and Gulf Coast News Agency, Inc. were indicted on obscenity charges relating to the interstate transportation of the boxes of films. Petitioners filed a motion to suppress use of the films as evidence. The motion was denied, and the petitioners were convicted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the warrantless projection of films a violation of the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that projection and viewing of the films constituted a search, and there were no exigent circumstances to justify the lack of a warrant. The fact that the FBI was lawfully in possession of the boxes did not grant them the authority to view the films without a warrant. The Court also held that the fact that the boxes had been opened by a third party, which placed information about the content of the films in plain view, did not alter the owner’s legitimate expectation of privacy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall concurred in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote an opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment. He argued that even if the films had been viewed by a third party before the FBI viewed them, the government could not consider the films to be in plain view and warrants unnecessary. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the partial concurrence and partial dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a dissent and argued that the Fourth Amendment only prevented unlawful searches and seizures by the government. Because the FBI received the films after the boxes had been opened to the point that the suggestive material was visible, the FBI’s viewing of the films did not violate Fourth Amendment rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26354,"name":"Glenn Zell","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/glenn_zell","view_count":0,"last_name":"Zell","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"glenn_zell"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners Arthur Randall Sanders, and others","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11559"},{"advocate":{"ID":23151,"name":"Elliott Schulder","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/elliott_schulder","view_count":0,"last_name":"Schulder","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"elliott_schulder"},"advocate_description":"for respondent in both cases","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11561"},{"advocate":{"ID":45640,"name":"W.

Williams and Eugene F. Diamond, doctors who perform medically necessary abortions, a welfare rights organization, and Jane Doe, a woman in poverty who needed an abortion for medical reasons but not to save her life, brought a class action suit against the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid in federal district court. The appellants challenged an Illinois statute that prohibited state medical assistance from paying for abortions that were not necessary to save the life of the mother. The appellants alleged that the Medicaid Act required the state to cover the cost of all medically necessary abortions.  They also alleged that the denial of funding for certain abortions is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the district court refused to consider the case until the state courts had reached a decision on the statute. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the decision and remanded the case to the district court to for consideration on the merits. The district court held that the Medicaid Act required a state to provide funding for all medically necessary abortions. The district court also held that the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for certain abortions, does not exempt the state from fulfilling the Medicaid requirements. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision and held that the Hyde Amendment allows a state to limit funding to the type of abortions the Amendment specifies. The case was remanded to the district court with instructions to consider the constitutional issues. The district court held that both the Illinois statute and the Hyde Amendment were unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the district court have the jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does the Hyde Amendment allow a state to limit its Medicaid funding of abortions to those specified by the Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Yes. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the district court lacked the jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, since none of the parties to the case challenged the Amendment. The opinion referenced \u003ci\u003eHarris v. McCrae\u003c/i\u003e, another opinion filed the same day, which upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment. The Court also held that a state is not obligated to pay for abortions through Medicaid when there will be no federal reimbursement because of the restrictions of the Hyde Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. dissented and argued that a state’s interest in protecting the life of a fetus could not come at the cost of denying poor women medically necessary abortions. He also argued that, in upholding the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, the Court allowed a state to yield undue influence over a woman’s decision whether or not to go through with a pregnancy; this influence disproportionally affects poor women. Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall dissented and argued that the Hyde Amendment essentially denies women in poverty the ability to have a legal abortion that protects their health but not their lives. Because the burden falls exclusively on poor women who cannot afford an abortion, he disagreed with the Court’s finding that the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun expressed that the Court refused to recognize the realities of poverty. He argued that such actions by the government wrongfully punish those living in poverty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice John Paul Stevens also wrote a dissenting opinion. He argued that, since the government provides Medicaid on the basis of expressed financial and medical need, it could not deny assistance when both of those needs have been shown. If a woman has a constitutional right to choose to protect her own health rather than the potential life of the fetus, the government cannot deny her assistance to which she would otherwise be entitled.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":46509,"name":"William A.

The parole officials released him after five months. Five months after his release on parole, he murdered Mary Ellen Martinez, a fifteen-year-old girl. Her family, sued the parole official for negligence, but the district court dismissed the case because a California statute states that a parole officer cannot be liable for injury resulting from the decision to revoke parole or release a parolee. The California Supreme Court also dismissed the case and the Martinez family appealed by arguing the statute of immunization of parole officials violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a statute immunizing parole officials from injuries resulting from parole decisions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Court held that a state statute immunizing parole officials from injuries resulting from parole decisions does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute does not condone the killing of a human being, but rather it protects parole officials who are required to make a difficult decision. There is always a risk involved in releasing a prisoner, and the parole officer must use his discretion in making the decision. The state has a parole program to promote rehabilitation and it is the duty of the state legislature, not the courts, to decide if that program is rational. Therefore, the suit against the parole officials by the family of a parolee’s murder victim is not actionable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31863,"name":"Jeffrey T.

These items were intended for sale both in and out of the State of California.  Sears sued for a refund of the tax in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.  The court granted Sears’ motion for summary judgment and awarded the refund.

The PSC\u0027s regulation distinguished promotional advertising from informational advertising, which was permitted. Central Hudson Gas and Electric challenged the regulation in a New York State Supreme Court, which upheld the regulation. The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court affirmed the decision, as did the New York Court of Appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the PSC\u0027s ban on advertising violate the freedom of speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 opinion, the Court overruled the Court of Appeals of New York and held that the New York\u0027s ban violated the right to commercial speech. Writing for the majority, Justice Lewis F. Powell cited the protections for \"commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation\" set forth in \u003cem\u003eVirginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council\u003c/em\u003e. The Court recognized New York\u0027s interest in promoting energy conservation and accepted that the PSC\u0027s regulation would directly further that interest. However, since the regulation restricted all promotional advertising regardless of its effect on electricity use, it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment under \u003cem\u003eFirst National Bank of Boston v.

Additionally, there are 15 piers on the coastline. The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 granted to California all land and resources within three miles of the coastline. California and the United States disputed over whether the island and piers were included in this coastline. A special master was appointed to resolve this dispute. The Special Master found that the island and piers did not affect the shoreline, and were therefore not extensions of the coastline. California filed an exception to the Master\u0027s finding.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo man-made piers and islands qualify as \"coast line\" under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous 8-0 decision, the Court held that the special master\u0027s determination was correct. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger acknowledged the ambiguity in the Submerged Lands Act. However, since the piers and island in dispute did not provide protection, they did not qualify as \"harbor works\" that would have extended the coastline.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42002,"name":"Stephen M.

The Court found that Congress could pursue the objectives of the minority business enterprise program under the Spending Power.

Aaron was in charge of supervising sales of securities made by other employees and maintaining files on the companies that issued the securities sold by the firm. In the fall of 1974, two of Aaron’s employees began telling prospective investors that they should buy shares of the Lawn-A-Mat Chemical \u0026amp; Equipment Corporation (Lawn-A-Mat) because the company planned to manufacture a new type of small car within the next six weeks. An attorney for Lawn-A-Mat contacted Aaron twice and informed him that the company had no plans to manufacture a car, but Aaron did not ensure that the employees would stop making those statements in promoting the Lawn-A-Mat stock. In 1976, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against Aaron in district court and alleged that he had violated, and aided and abetted violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), Section 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”), and Rule 10b-5, which is a rule promulgated by the SEC to implement Section 10(b). The district court found that Aaron had violated the securities laws in question through his “intentional failure” to stop the fraudulent practices of the employees working under him. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment but declined to reach the question of whether Aaron’s conduct amounted to an intent to “deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Instead the Court of Appeals held that proof of negligence is sufficient to establish a violation of Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, and Rule 10b-5.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust the SEC prove that that the defendant intended to “deceive, manipulate, or defraud” in an action that alleges violations of Section 17(a) of the ’33 Act and Section 10(b) of the ’34 Act and Rule 10b-5?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that plain language and the legislative history of the statutes required the SEC to establish defendant’s intent to “deceive, manipulate, or defraud” for violations of Section 10(b) and the part of Section 17(a) that specifically refers to the use of a device, scheme, or artifice with intent to defraud. Employing the same textual and legislative history analysis, the Court further held that the parts Section 17(a) that deal with false statements, omissions of fact, and transactions or practices that operate as fraud do not contain an intent requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a concurring opinion in which he urged those critical of the public policy implications to voice their complaints to Congress. He also argued that the Court of Appeals should have affirmed the ruling on the ground that Aaron “intentionally failed” to terminate the fraudulent statements about Lawn-A-Mat stock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he argued that the SEC should not be required to prove the defendants intent to establish a violation of Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, or Section 17(a). Justice William J.

Roberts was charged with forgery of a check in the name of Bernard Isaacs and of possessing stolen credit cards belonging to Amy Isaacs. At the preliminary hearing on January 10, Roberts’ lawyer called the Isaacs’ daughter, Anita, as a witness to testify that she knew Roberts and allowed him to use her apartment while she was away. The attorney attempted to elicit testimony from Anita that she gave Roberts the checks and credit cards without telling him that she did not have permission to do so. Ms. Isaacs would not admit to these actions, and Roberts’ attorney did not ask the court to declare her a hostile witness or place her on cross-examination. When Ms. Isaacs failed to respond to five subpoenas to appear at Roberts’ subsequent criminal trial, the state entered the transcript of her earlier testimony into evidence, as allowed by an Ohio Statute. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being convicted by the trial court, Roberts appealed on the grounds that the admission of the prior testimony violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the conviction and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the introduction into evidence of prior testimony of a witness who had not been cross-examined violate the Sixth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to restrict the admission of unreliable hearsay into evidence. Generally, face-to-face confrontation is preferred as it allows the accused to probe the memory of the witness and allows the jury to take the demeanor of the witness into account when assessing the reliability of the testimony. The Court held that the opportunity for face-to-face interaction with, and cross-examination of, the witness at the previous hearing satisfied the requirements of the Confrontation Clause for the later trial. Although Ms. Isaacs was not officially cross-examined, the questions she answered had the proper form and intent to satisfy the purpose of cross-examination and establish the reliability of the testimony. The Court also held that a witness may be declared officially unavailable if a good-faith effort was made to locate her, as was the case with Ms. Isaacs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that the state did not meet its burden to show a diligent effort to locate Ms. Isaacs. The state sent subpoenas to the home of Ms. Isaacs’ parents, although there was evidence that she no longer resided there, and made no further effort to locate her new residence. Without evidence of a diligent effort to locate the witness, the requirements of the Confrontation Clause could not be circumvented. Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice John Paul Stevens joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36495,"name":"Marvin R.

He was moonlighting for Joseph Vinal Ship Maintenance, Inc. as a harbor worker on the SS \u003ci\u003eExport Builder\u003c/i\u003e, a vessel owned by American Export Lines, Inc (“AELI”). On October 13, 1972, while the SS \u003ci\u003eExport Builder\u003c/i\u003e was in New York waters, the handle of a defective tension jack struck Alvez in the eye. He completely lost his right eye in the accident. He also suffered from depression as a result of the accident and his injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvez sued AELI in New York, claiming damages resulting from AELI’s negligence and the unseaworthiness of their ship. Alvez then moved to add his wife, Juanita Alvez, as a party plaintiff, claiming that his injuries deprived her of the benefits of their marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (“Jones Act”) created several classes of sea workers, allowing a wider breadth of causes of action for those injured within the United States’ territorial waters. It did not, however, specifically provide a cause of action for loss of consortium for spouses. Similarly, the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 (“DOHSA”) did not create a specific right to a cause of action for loss of consortium. The district court denied the claim for loss of consortium. The appellate court reversed, noting that while such motions were not available in some maritime law cases, the Supreme Court in \u003ci\u003eSea-Land Servs. v. Gaudet\u003c/i\u003e allowed a decedent’s dependents to recover for loss of society in a wrongful death maritime law claim. Thus, there is no clear precedent prohibiting claims of loss of consortium from nonfatal injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew York’s Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. It rejected AELI’s use of \u003ci\u003eIgneri v. Cie. De Transports Oceaniques\u003c/i\u003e, a U.S. Court of Appeals Second Circuit decision holding that the spouse of an injured longshoreman had no cause of action for loss of consortium. It noted that most states now allowed a spouse to state a cause of action for loss of consortium. It also reasoned that the heavy burden now placed on Juanita Alvez as a marriage partner justified allowing her to sue for damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay Alvez’s wife sue American Export Lines, Inc. for loss of consortium, as a result of AELI’s negligence and the unseaworthiness of the USS \u003ci\u003eExport Builder\u003c/i\u003e, under federal maritime law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 decision with two concurrences, Justice William Brennan held that maritime law authorizes Juanita Alvez to maintain an action for damages against AELI resulting from the loss of her husband’s society. He rejected AELI’s argument that the Jones Act and DOHSA represented Congress’ intention to preclude actions for loss of consortium or society. He noted that DOHSA centered on relief for fatal injuries on the high seas, not nonfatal injuries within terrestrial waters, and that the Jones Act does not exhaustively regulate the claims of longshoremen or seamen. Justice Brennan agreed with the lower courts that the Court’s recent maritime law decisions eroded the justification for denying claims used in \u003ci\u003eIgneri\u003c/i\u003e. He also pointed to the contemporary state of the law, where a clear majority of states permitted a wife to recover damages for loss of consortium from personal injuries to her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis Powell concurred, writing that there was no rational basis for drawing a distinction between fatal and nonfatal injuries in loss of consortium cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justices Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist, dissented. He questioned the majority’s assumption that the federal question at hand would necessarily survive AELI’s appeals in state court. He warned against the practice of granting review to non-final lower court orders, and recommended denying certiorari to such cases in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41150,"name":"Stephen K.

Under this authority, the Virginia court promulgated the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility (Bar Code), and the content makes it clear that the Virginia court holds all legislative and regulatory power over the legal profession in the state. The court also adjudicates alleged violations of the Bar Code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1974, Consumers Union of the United States sought to prepare a legal directory designed to assist consumers in making informed decisions about legal representation. Consumers Union attempted to canvass all of the attorneys of Arlington County, Virginia, for the information for their directory. Many attorneys refused to provide the requested information for fear of violating the Bar Code’s prohibition against attorney advertising and providing the type of information the Consumers Union sought to publish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 27, 1975, Consumers Union and the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council sued the Virginia Supreme Court, the Virginia State Bar, the American Bar Association, and other individuals. The plaintiffs alleged violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to gather, publish, and receive factual information concerning attorneys practicing in Arlington County. The plaintiffs sought a declaration and an injunction against the enforcement of the relevant section of the Bar Code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court held that the section of the Bar Code unconstitutionally restricted access to information concerning the attorneys’ initial consultation fees, but did not enjoin the enforcement of the code as it relates to advertising. Consumers Union appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that the prohibition of attorney advertising violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case. On remand, the district court held that the section of the Bar Code was unconstitutional in its entirety and enjoined its enforcement. Consumers Union moved for the awarding of attorneys fees, which the Virginia Court objected to on the grounds that it had judicial immunity. The district court awarded attorneys fees against the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Supreme Court of Virginia immune from a suit brought under the Civil Rights Code of 1983?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan the Supreme Court of Virginia be liable for attorney’s fees?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, no. Justice Byron R. White delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the Supreme Court of Virginia was immune to suits in its legislative capacity, just as any other legislative body would be. However, the Supreme Court of Virginia has the power to enforce the Code, and this suit was brought against it in its enforcement capacity. The Court held that suits for declaratory and injunctive relief can be brought against the Supreme Court of Virginia in its enforcement capacity. The Court also held that the Supreme Court of Virginia cannot be liable for attorney’s fees because it has legislative immunity. The legislative history surrounding the issue of legislative immunity shows that Congress intended agencies that have legislative immunity to also be immune from attorney’s fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F.

When officers arrived to conduct the search, they also conducted a cursory pat down for weapons on all of the patrons in the bar, pursuant to an Illinois state statute that allows officers to search persons on the premises during the execution of a valid search warrant. During the pat down, an officer found and retrieved a cigarette pouch from the pocket of one of the patrons, Ventura Ybarra, that contained tin foil packets of a substance later confirmed to be heroin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYbarra was subsequently indicted for possession of a controlled substance. He filed a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence of the contraband that had been seized from his person during the search at the bar. The trial court denied the motion. Ybarra was found guilty. On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the statute as it applied to the facts of this case because it was obvious that there was a connection between Ybarra and the premises being searched. The Illinois Supreme Court denied Ybarra’s petition for appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Illinois state statute that allows authorities to search persons on the premises during the execution of a valid search warrant violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Supreme Court held that there was no probable cause to suspect any of the patrons of committing a crime simply because they are on the premises during a search. Without any particular indication that a person is connected to the premises for the reasons the search is being conducted, a police search of the person violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also held that even an initial pat-down search is unconstitutional without a reasonable belief that the person is armed and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the majority’s opinion creates an unnecessarily broad reading of the exclusionary rule and ignores the practical needs of law enforcement. He also argued that it was perfectly reasonable for the police to search persons found on the premises of a bar known as a place for the procurement of drugs and that the law must account for the safety of officers in performing their duty. Justices Harry A. Blackmun and William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Rehnquist wrote that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment calls for specificity regarding the location to be searched and the person or things to be seized, not the persons from whom items will be taken. He argued that it was not practical to prohibit law enforcement from flexibility in the performance of their duty. The courts may consider the reasonableness of an individual search based on the scope of the intrusion and the justification to determine whether it violated the defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights. Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36413,"name":"Melbourne A.

After Godfrey consumed a number of beers, threatened his wife with a knife, and tore her clothes, she threatened to leave him and then left to stay with relatives. Within a few days, she had secured a warrant against Godfrey for aggravated assault and filed for divorce. On September 20, they argued again, and Godfrey’s wife told him that reconciliation was impossible. Godfrey went to his mother-in-law’s trailer with his shotgun. He shot his wife through the window, struck his daughter with the butt of the gun, and shot his mother-in-law. Godfrey then called the police, explained what had happened, and asked them to come and pick him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodfrey was indicted on two counts of murder, and one count of aggravated assault. He pled not guilty, and argued the defense of temporary insanity. Godfrey was found guilty, and at the sentencing phase of the trial, the same jury sentenced him to the death penalty on both counts of murder. Georgia law states that a person my be convicted of murder and sentenced to the death penalty if it was beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense committed was “outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of the mind, or an aggressive battery to the victim.” The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Georgia law governing the death penalty “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the Eighth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart delivered the opinion of the 6-3 plurality. The Supreme Court held that the Georgia law was unconstitutionally vague and failed to properly distinguish between those cases that would be eligible for the death penalty and those that wouldn’t. Even accepting the law, the Court found no evidence that Godfrey’s crimes contained the elements described in the law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a concurring opinion where he argued not only that the law was unconstitutional, but also that a death penalty sentencing requires much more restrictive sentencing guidelines. He also argued that the death penalty itself was unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that the plurality’s decision leads to death penalty sentences being imposed on a case-by-case basis, which is more arbitrary than the current Georgia law. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Byron R. White argued that the Georgia law provided strict enough requirements to ensure that the imposition of the death penalty was not disproportionate to the crime. He also argued that the Supreme Court should not interfere with the decisions of the Georgia Supreme Court when they are “responsibly and consistently interpreting state law.” Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30883,"name":"J.

The standard reduced the allowable amount from 10 parts per million (ppm) to one ppm. This case was decided together with Marshall v.

The Court agreed with the Court of Appeals that the Secretary had acted without knowledge that the new standard was necessary to \"provide safe and healthful employment\" as mandated by the Act. Nothing in OSHA\u0027s administrative record indicated that exposure to benzene at 10 ppm would cause leukemia and that exposure to one ppm would not. Since the Secretary had not made a threshold finding that exposure to 10 ppm posed significant health risks, he was powerless to promulgate the new standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25102,"name":"George H.

Before his trial, he advised the court that the Government would call his wife as a witness against him. The indictment named Mrs. Trammel as an unindicted co-conspirator and the Government granted her immunity in exchange for her testimony. Otis moved to assert a privilege against adverse spousal testimony to prevent her from testifying against him. The district court denied the motion, and allowed Mrs. Trammel to testify to any act she observed during the marriage and any communication made in the presence of a third party. Only confidential communications between Mr. and Mrs. Trammel remained privileged and inadmissible. Otis was tried and convicted. On appeal, Otis argued that the district court’s ruling violated \u003cem\u003eHawkins v. United States\u003c/em\u003e where the U.S. Supreme Court held that one spouse may not testify against the other unless both consent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit affirmed, holding that the \u003cem\u003eHawkins\u003c/em\u003e did not prevent voluntary testimony of a spouse who appears as an unindicted co-conspirator under grant of immunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs it a reversible error to permit a wife to be called as a witness against her husband over his objection and without his consent?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for eight members of the court, affirmed the 10th Circuit. The Supreme Court held that the rule from \u003cem\u003eHawkins\u003c/em\u003e was modified so that the privilege against adverse spousal testimony vested in the witness spouse alone. A witness may not be compelled to testify or foreclosed from testifying. Information disclosed privately between a husband and wife is still privileged under a separate rule protecting confidential marital communications. Justice Potter Stewart concurred in the judgment, writing that the foundations for the privilege against adverse spousal testimony disappeared long before \u003cem\u003eHawkins\u003c/em\u003e was ever decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33458,"name":"J.
