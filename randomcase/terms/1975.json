Officers then arrested the third party and returned to Santana\u0027s house where they identified themselves as police officers, entered the house after Santana fled into it from the porch, and, after ordering her to empty her pockets, discovered some of the marked money.

Relying on the the Court\u0027s decision in United States v. Watson (1976), Justice Rehnquist argued that by standing on her porch when the officers arrived, Santana was \"not in an area where she had any expectation of privacy.\" Since the police had probable cause to arrest and search her at that point, their behavior was consistent with the Court\u0027s Watson precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23867,"name":"Frank H.

At the end of every fiscal year, the institution that received the aid must report all financial transactions and identify the nonsectarian expenditures within those transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour Maryland taxpayers sued to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and argued that the statute benefited certain church-affiliated institutions that are constitutionally ineligible for this form of aid under the First Amendment. The district court applied the three-part test from \u003cem\u003eLemon v. Kurtzman \u003c/em\u003e― which asks whether the state aid has a secular purpose, a primary effect other than the advancement of religion, and doesn’t excessively entangle the state in church affairs ― and determined that the statute was constitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid a 1971 statute that allocated Maryland taxpayer money to private religiously-affiliated schools for “nonsectarian” purposes violate the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA 1971 statute that allocated Maryland taxpayer money to private religiously-affiliated schools for “nonsectarian” purposes did not violate the First Amendment. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the 5-4 majority opinion. The Court held that the law passed the “Lemon Test” from the Court’s decision in \u003cem\u003eLemon v. Kurtzman\u003c/em\u003e. The majority concluded that funds given to private, religiously-affiliated schools would not become wrapped up in religious uses simply because they were presented to a religious school. As such, there was no violation of the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he argued that the three-part test the Court established in \u003cem\u003eLemon v. Kurtzman\u003c/em\u003e was unnecessary to determine whether a statute violates the First Amendment. As long as there was a secular legislative purpose and the primary effect of the statute was not to advance or inhibit religion, there was no need to examine whether the statute would lead to an excessive entanglement of the state with religion. In this case, everyone agreed that the purpose of the legislation was secular and that the primary effect was not to promote religion, so the statute was constitutional. Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the concurrence in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissent, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote that, because the funds were not “ear-marked” at payment, they were essentially general subsidies of public funds to religious institutions, which was precisely the type of entanglement between religion and the state that the First Amendment was enacted the prevent. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissent in which he argued that government funds provided to religious institutions could incentivize such institutions to alter their missions and therefore act as a deterrent to the goals of the religious institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25848,"name":"George A.

This scheme mandated the death penalty\u0027s imposition, regardless of any mercy recommendation, whenever the jury found that the defendant demonstrated a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm while in the commission of at least one of five different narrowly defined types of homicide. The sentencing scheme also required juries, in all first-degree murder cases, to be instructed on the lesser charges of manslaughter and second degree murder even if no evidence existed to support such verdicts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis case is one of the five \"Death Penalty Cases\" along with \u003cem\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"/cases/1975/74_6257/\"\u003eGregg v.

By mandating the death penalty\u0027s imposition for certain crimes, Louisiana\u0027s sentencing scheme fails to afford juries the constitutionally required opportunity to consider any mitigating factors presented either by the circumstances of the crime or the individual offender\u0027s character. The Supreme Court also held that by requiring jurors to be instructed on the lesser charges of manslaughter and second-degree murder, even if no evidence exits to support such verdicts, Louisiana\u0027s sentencing scheme encourages them to disregard their oaths by recommending a verdict for a lesser offense whenever they feel that the death penalty is inappropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38778,"name":"Robert H.

The County levied a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on the goods (a percent of the property\u0027s value). MTC claimed that the contents of the warehouse were constitutionally free from state taxation because they were in their original containers. The county declared that the products were subject to the tax because they had been sorted and arranged for sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Gwinnett County tax violate the Import-Export Clause by taxing goods that maintained the character of imports?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court affirmed the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court, finding the tax to be valid. The Court stated that the Framers of the Constitution had adopted the Import-Export Clause to give the federal government a source of revenue and the superior position to regulate such foreign trade. This was to overcome the problems under the Articles of Confederation where states lacked uniformity in import regulation, burdening inter-state trade. The property tax was consistent with the Import-Export Clause because it did not (1) interfere with the Federal Government\u0027s regulation of foreign commerce (2) deprive the Federal Government of its exclusive right to revenues from imposts and duties on imports (3) interfere with the free flow of goods between the states. It taxed the use of the property and was not based on the origin of the goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22794,"name":"Earle B.

The informant had provided the inspector with reliable information in the past, and, later that day, provided the inspector with a stolen card. The inspector asked the informant to arrange another meeting with Watson to deliver more stolen cards. At the meeting on August 23, when the informant gave the signal, officers revealed themselves and arrested Watson. The officers read Watson his Miranda warning and searched him but did not find the cards on his person. They asked to search his car, and Watson gave them permission. In the car, officers found two stolen cards. Watson was then charged with four counts of possessing stolen mail. Prior to the trial, Watson moved to suppress the cards by claiming his arrest was illegal because there was no warrant, and that the search of his car was involuntary because he was not informed that he could withhold consent. The motion was denied and Watson was convicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and held that the arrest was unconstitutional because the postal inspector had sufficient time to obtain a warrant but failed to do so. The Court of Appeals also held that the subsequent search was coerced and hence unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the arrest and following search of the respondent’s car violate his Fourth Amendment rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the 6-2 majority. The Court held that postal inspectors have the power to execute an arrest without a warrant when there is probable cause. Congress has granted this power to several federal agencies, not just the postal service. Because Watson’s arrest was constitutional, the search of his car was not the product of an illegal arrest. The Court held that there was no evidence that Watson was coerced into agreeing to the car search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote that there was established historical precedent for warrantless arrests. He also argued that interpreting the Fourth Amendment as always requiring a warrant prior to arrest would severely and negatively impact effective law enforcement. Justice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion where he argued that the arrest occurred with probable cause, in broad daylight, in a public place and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment. He also held that the majority’s decision in this case does not set any precedent regarding under what circumstances an officer may make a warrantless arrest in a private place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent and argued that the majority’s opinion grants police broad powers to make warrantless arrests and breaks with precedents already set regarding the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment. He argued that the majority’s opinion goes beyond the bounds of the case in question and misinterprets common law history. He wrote that the Fourth Amendment was intended to protect people, not places, and that the interests of the people would be best served with a warrant requirement. The warrant requirement would not unduly burden the police because there is no reason to assume that it would cause any delay in an arrest, unless exigent circumstances are present, in which case the arrest may be made without a warrant. He also argued that the government did not meet its burden to show that Watson’s consent was not coerced. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens took no part in the discussion or decision in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36417,"name":"Michael D.

The banks complied with the subpoenas, and the evidence was used during Miller\u0027s trial in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.

He counterclaimed alleging “extreme cruelty and adultery”.  The court granted the divorce with an ambiguous decree that did not specify the grounds.  Time Magazine printed an article reporting that Firestone’s extreme cruelty and adultery caused the divorce.  Firestone requested a retraction, but Time refused.  Firestone sued Time, Inc. for libel in Florida state court.  The circuit court entered a judgment in favor of Firestone for $100,000.  The Florida District Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Florida court’s judgment violate Time’s First Amendment protections?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 6-2 vote, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion vacating the lower judgment and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that the actual malice standard for media reports on public figures did not apply.  Firestone was not a public figure as defined by prior precedent.  The Court also held the Florida judgment invalid because the court awarded damages without determining fault.  Justice Lewis Powell wrote a concurrence, stating that the ultimate question is whether Time exercised reasonably prudent care in light of the ambiguous divorce decree.

Among other things, the law set limits on the amount of money an individual could contribute to a single campaign and it required reporting of contributions above a certain threshold amount. The Federal Election Commission was created to enforce the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the limits placed on electoral expenditures by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, violate the First Amendment\u0027s freedom of speech and association clauses?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn this complicated case, the Court arrived at two important conclusions. First, it held that restrictions on individual contributions to political campaigns and candidates did not violate the First Amendment since the limitations of the FECA enhance the \"integrity of our system of representative democracy\" by guarding against unscrupulous practices. Second, the Court found that governmental restriction of independent expenditures in campaigns, the limitation on expenditures by candidates from their own personal or family resources, and the limitation on total campaign expenditures did violate the First Amendment. Since these practices do not necessarily enhance the potential for corruption that individual contributions to candidates do, the Court found that restricting them did not serve a government interest great enough to warrant a curtailment on free speech and association.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17533,"name":"Brice M.

On appeal from an adverse ruling by a three-judge District Court panel, the Supreme Court granted the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a statutory ban on advertising prescription drug prices by licensed pharmacists a violation of \"commercial speech\" under the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-to-1 opinion, the Court held that the First Amendment protects willing speakers and willing listeners equally. The Court noted that in cases of commercial speech, such as price advertising, freedom of speech protections apply just as they would to noncommercial speech. Even speech that is sold for profit, or involves financial solicitations, is protected. The Court concluded that although the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy has a legitimate interest in preserving professionalism among its members, it may not do so at the expense of public knowledge about lawful competitive pricing terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16500,"name":"Alan B.

William Baird, on behalf of an abortion counseling organization, Parents Aid Society, filed a class action under the Fourteenth Amendment challenging the statute against state Attorney General Frances Bellotti and all district attorneys within the state. Baird argued that the statute created a parental veto. Parental vetoes were ruled unconstitutional in \u003cem\u003ePlanned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth\u003c/em\u003e. The federal District Court struck down the law. Bellotti appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, contending that the District Court should have abstained until a decision on the statute by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the federal District Court have abstained from rendering a judgment until a decision from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the Court held that the District Court should have abstained and vacated the judgment. There was ambiguity in whether the Massachusetts statute created a \"parental veto,\" which under \u003cem\u003ePlanned Parenthood v. Danforth\u003c/em\u003e affected the constitutionality of the statute. Since the Supreme Judicial Court\u0027s ruling would have resolved the ambiguity, the District Court should have abstained.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41951,"name":"S.

(Brada Miller) agreed to lease a tractor and trailer operated by its employee-driver, H. L. Hardrick, to fellow licensed motor carrier Transamerican Freight Lines, Inc. (Transamerican) for a shipment from Detroit, Michigan, to Kansas City, Missouri. The agreement stated that Transamerican assumed control and responsibility for the operation of the equipment during the lease and that Brada Miller agreed to indemnify Transamerican from any and all claims related to any negligence on the part of Brada Miller or its employees. On the way to Kansas City, the truck collided with another car in Illinois. The injured driver sued both Brada Miller and Transamerican in federal district court and alleged that the accident was caused by Hardrick’s negligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransamerican settled with the driver for $80,000 and then sued Brada Miller seeking indemnification for the settlement amount and costs of litigation. The district court held that the indemnity clause was unenforceable because it was contrary to public policy and granted summary judgment in favor of Brada Miller. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed and held that the indemnification clause was an attempt to circumvent regulations promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that required carriers to exert actual control and responsibility over leased equipment and borrowed drivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the “control-and-responsibility” provisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission’s regulations on equipment leasing prohibit an agreement between carriers in which the lessor indemnifies the lessee for a loss caused by the negligence of the lessor?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 9-0 majority. The Court held that the indemnification provision did not contravene ICC regulations designed to prevent motor carriers from sharing operating authority in order to evade safety requirements and limit each carrier’s liability to the public. The Court noted that the indemnity clause likely increases public safety as it holds the lessor accountable for its own negligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas concurred in the judgment, but declined to write separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17180,"name":"Alphonso H.

The Court held that the death penalty was not a \"cruel and unusual\" punishment per se, and that Florida\u0027s capital-sentencing procedure was not unconstitutionally arbitrary and/or capricious. Although empowering trial judges with sole sentencing authority, the statutory procedure tightly prescribed their relevant decision-making process. The procedure requires sentencing judges to focus on both the crime\u0027s circumstances and the defendant\u0027s character by weighing eight statutory aggravating factors against seven statutory mitigating factors. Furthermore, sentencing judges are required to submit a written explanation of their death-sentence finding for the purpose of automatic review by Florida\u0027s Supreme Court. Such strict requirements sufficiently safeguard against the presence of any constitutional deficiencies arising from an arbitrary and/or capricious imposition of the death penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18585,"name":"Clinton A.

Under the plan, customers who used over the system-wide average would have to pay extra, and those who used less would receive a rebate.  The Federal Power Commission (FPC) rejected the plan, stating it violated the Natural Gas Act, which prohibits discrimination among customers.  The TGPL sought review of the FPC decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  The court directed the FPC to conduct a review of TGPL’s records to determine the extent of the gas shortage.  The FPC refused, arguing that the court overstepped its bounds by interfering with an independent administrative agency.  The FPC also argued that the extent of the gas shortage was not material to the issues in the litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the U.S. Court of Appeals have the power to direct the FPC to conduct a review of TGPL’s gas shortage?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals order.  The Supreme Court held that the appeals court overstepped its bounds by not reviewing the FPC’s decision based on the information given.  The Court remanded the case so the FPC could use its discretion to decide how to best develop their evidence going forward.  Justices Lewis F.

Gonzales was also denied admission to Fairfax- Brewster School. McCrary and Gonzales\u0027s parents filed a class action against the schools, suspecting the denials were due to their children\u0027s race. A federal district court ruled for McCrary and Gonzales, finding that the school\u0027s admission policies were racially discriminatory.

Two city ordinances enacted in 1972 prohibited the opening of adult theaters within 1,000 feet of other buildings with \"regulated uses\" or within 500 feet of any residential district. American Mini sued city officials challenging the ordinances on two grounds: that the ordinances imposed an undue burden on First Amendment rights and that ordinances violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause. A federal district court ruled in favor of the city, a decision that was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The appeals court concluded that the ordinances posed a prior restraint based on content and that the ordinances ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1): Did Detroit\u0027s 1972 ordinances violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2): Did the ordinances qualify as a restriction on free speech in violation of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a 5-4 opinion, the court reversed the Sixth Circuit and held that Detroit\u0027s ordinances were reasonable, and although erotic material could not be completely suppressed, Detroit had adequate reasons to restrict the distribution of such material. Justice John Paul Stevens doubted that Voltaire\u0027s observation – \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\" – applied to pornographic films. This prompted a stinging rebuke from Justice Potter Stewart who maintained that the free expression is neither defined nor circumscribed by popular opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36593,"name":"Maureen P.

According to the government, Hampton told Hutton that he could acquire heroin and was willing to sell it. Hutton replied that he would find a buyer and orchestrate a sale. Hampton and Hutton arranged two appointments with DEA agents posing as buyers. At the second appointment, Hampton was arrested. According to Hampton, he was unaware that he was selling heroin. He claimed that Hutton provided him with the drugs and that Hutton had told him they were counterfeit. Since the government, through Hutton, had provided him with the drugs, he had been entrapped and was therefore not guilty. Hampton was convicted after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, alleging entrapment and a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Hampton\u0027s conviction a result of entrapment and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-3 decision, the Court affirmed the judgment of the Eighth Circuit.

He received two parking tickets from local police officers, and as a result, his vehicle was subsequently inspected and impounded. At the impound lot, a police officer observed personal items in the dashboard of the car and unlocked the door to inventory the items using standard procedures. In the unlocked glove compartment, the officer found marijuana in a plastic bag. Opperman was arrested later that day and charged with possession of marijuana. He was convicted but the Supreme Court of South Dakota reversed on appeal and concluded the search was in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause prohibit police from inventorying a vehicle that is lawfully impounded for traffic violations, without first obtaining a warrant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Mr. Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger delivered opinion for the 6-3 majority. The Court held that police can inventory a vehicle that has been lawfully impounded, even without a warrant. Inventory procedures for impounded vehicles are taken in order to protect the owner’s property and to protect police from claims of stolen items as well as potential danger. Therefore, the search of an impounded vehicle is considered reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Louis F. Powell, Jr. wrote a concurring opinion agreeing that the Constitution allows inventory searches, as long as the search is not done in order to find evidence that could lead to criminal charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall, with whom Justice William J. Brennan Jr. and Justice Potter Stewart join, wrote a dissent arguing that the search of an automobile without a warrant clearly violates the Fourth Amendment. A routine inventory is no excuse to violate the privacy of the automobile’s owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45112,"name":"William J.

The Court found three problems with the law: First, the law \"depart[ed] markedly from contemporary standards\" concerning death sentences. The historical record indicated that the public had rejected mandatory death sentences. Second, the law provided no standards to guide juries in their exercise of \"the power to determine which first-degree murderers shall live and which shall die.\" Third, the statute failed to allow consideration of the character and record of individual defendants before inflicting the death penalty. The Court noted that \"the fundamental respect for humanity\" underlying the Eighth Amendment required such considerations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41278,"name":"Sidney S.

Furthermore, the capital sentencing procedure in Texas was not unconstitutional on the theory that it would result in arbitrary and freakish impositions of the death penalty. While death penalty sentencing systems which permit juries to consider only aggravating, and no mitigating, circumstances are unconstitutional, Texas\u0027 sentencing system is not like this. Under its sentencing scheme, Texas juries may consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances there may be - thus allowing them to ponder not only why the death penalty should be imposed, but also why it should not. These options sufficiently focus the juries\u0027 attention on the defendant\u0027s unique circumstances and character, thus meeting constitutional requirements of particularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15391,"name":"Anthony G.

Paul Imbler was convicted of the murder after three eyewitnesses identified him as the gunman. After the trial, the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Richard Pachtman, wrote to the Governor of California and described newly discovered evidence that undermined the testimony of one of the eyewitnesses. In light of the letter, Imbler challenged his incarceration in state court, where his petition was denied, and later in federal court. The federal district court found that Pachtman had knowingly used false testimony during the trial and suppressed evidence favorable to Imbler, so the district court ordered Imbler released from prison. Imbler then filed an action against Pachtman in federal court under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which allows a party to recover damages from any person who acts “under color of state law” to deprive another of a constitutional right. The district court held that Pachtman was immune for civil liability for acts done in his capacity as prosecutor and dismissed the complaint. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal on appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a prosecutor have absolute immunity from civil liability for actions taken within the scope of his duties in bringing and pursuing a criminal prosecution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority. The Court held that prosecutors have the same absolute immunity under Section 1983 that they had under common law in malicious prosecution suits. In both situations, there are similar public policy concerns related to the need for prosecutorial independence. The Court declined to consider whether a prosecutor was entitled to similar level of immunity for actions taken in the role of an administrator or investigator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he agreed that a prosecutor is absolutely immune for the knowing or reckless presentation of false testimony, but that absolute immunity should not shield claims against a prosecutor for the unconstitutional suppression of evidence. Justice White argued that the denial of immunity would encourage prosecutors to turn over more information than necessary, which would be beneficial to the judicial process overall. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined the opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39544,"name":"Roger S.

Wisconsin law prohibited strikes by public employees. The School District invited the teachers to return to work several times, and a few teachers accepted the offer. After about two weeks of striking, the school board set disciplinary hearings for the teachers who continued to strike. An attorney for the teachers indicated that the teachers wished to be treated as a group and argued that the school board was not sufficiently impartial to be able to exercise discipline over the teachers. The attorney argued that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required an independent, unbiased decision maker. The school board still voted to terminate the teachers, but invited them to reapply for their jobs. One teacher did so and returned to work. The remaining teachers were replaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fired teachers sued the school district in Wisconsin state court alleging that their termination violated their due process. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the school district, holding that due process was not violated because the teachers admitted to being on strike in violation of state law after receiving adequate notice and a hearing. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Due Process Clause required the teachers\u0027 conduct and the school board’s decision to be evaluated by an impartial decision maker.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Due Process prevent a school district from firing teachers engaged in an illegal strike, even though they have exclusive authority to do so under state law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed the Wisconsin Supreme Court and remanded. The Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause did not guarantee the teachers an independent review of the decision to terminate them. The fact that the school district had negotiated with the teachers earlier and had knowledge of the events surrounding the strike did not make them incapable of giving the teachers due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart dissented, arguing that the case should be remanded for a determination of whether the school board must consider the reasonableness of the strike considering its own actions, or whether it is free to exercise its discretion when deciding to terminated teachers. Justice William J. Brennan and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33704,"name":"Jack D.

The Court found that the right of governmental employment was not per se fundamental, and that uniformed state police officers over 50 did not constitute a suspect class under the Clause. Applying a rational relationship test, the Court reasoned that the statute was sufficiently justified as a means of protecting the public \"by assuring physical preparedness of [the] uniformed police.\" The Court noted that while the law may not have been the best means to accomplish this purpose, it did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment merely because of its imperfections.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39020,"name":"Robert D.

Mosley was taken to police headquarters, where he was informed of his Miranda rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present. After Mosley signed the police department’s constitutional rights notification certificate, Detective James Cowie began to question Mosley, but he immediately stopped when Mosley said that he did not wish to speak about the robberies. A few hours later, Detective Hill brought Mosley out from his cell to question him about the recent murder of a man named Leroy Williams, and Mosley was again informed of his Miranda rights. At first Mosley denied any involvement, but after being informed that another man had named him as the shooter, he made statements implicating himself in the murder. During the second interrogation, he never asked for a lawyer or refused to answer questions. Mosley was subsequently charged with first-degree murder. Mosley moved to suppress his incriminating statement and argued that Detective Hill’s interrogation and eventual use of his incriminating comment violated his Miranda rights. The trial court denied his motion, and he was found guilty and given the mandatory sentence of life in prison. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and held that the trial court’s failure to suppress Mosley’s statement was a per se violation of Mosley’s Miranda rights. The Michigan Supreme Court denied further review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the re-initiation of interrogation after a suspect has invoked his right to silence under \u003cem\u003eMiranda v. Arizona\u003c/em\u003e violate the suspect’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to silence and the presence of counsel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe re-initiation of interrogation after a suspect has invoked his right to silence is not a per se violation of Miranda rights, as long as the suspect’s invocation of his rights is honored. Justice Potter Stewart delivered the decision for the 6-2 majority. The Court held that the Miranda rule, which requires an immediate cessation of questioning if the individual in custody wishes not to speak, does not clearly establish the circumstances under which questioning may be resumed. The Miranda rule could bar the police from questioning the individual again in regards to any subject, or it could require a complete break from any current questioning but allow for re-initiation of another round of questioning at a later time. The Court held that Miranda only required that the suspect’s right to refuse to answer questions be honored. In this case, the Court held that Mosley’s invocation of his right to silence had been honored because the interrogation ceased as soon as he stated he did not wish to continue, he was read his rights again before interrogation was re-initiated, and a significant amount of time passed between the two interrogations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Byron R. White wrote that, to keep from unnecessarily hindering the fact-finding process, only confessions made as “the result of involuntary waivers” of judgment should be excluded in regards to a trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent in which he argued that the majority’s ruling degraded the protection of self-incrimination rights that the Miranda decision represented because it allowed for police officials to sidestep the Miranda protections. Justice Brennan also noted that individual states have the power to establish greater protections of the Miranda rights than those set by the majority opinion. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20441,"name":"Carl Ziemba","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/carl_ziemba","view_count":0,"last_name":"Ziemba","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"carl_ziemba"},"advocate_description":"for respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10281"},{"advocate":{"ID":42897,"name":"Thomas Khalil","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/thomas_khalil","view_count":0,"last_name":"Khalil","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"thomas_khalil"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10282"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15835,"title":"Oral Argument - October 06, 1975","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15835"}],"citation":{"volume":"423","page":"96","year":"1975","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/15401"},"decisions":[{"description":"Moseley\u0027s Miranda rights were not violated because he was read his rights again and significant amount of time passed between interrogations.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15043,"name":"Potter Stewart","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/potter_stewart","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stewart","roles":[{"id":2687,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-353962800,"date_end":362984400,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

The respondents, a class of female employees of General Electric Company, sued their employer for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court held that the plan violated the Act, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the exclusion of pregnancy-related benefits from the company disability plan violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that employers have the right to exclude any condition from a disability plan with a reasonable basis. The Court referred to a previous decision, Geduldig v. Aniello, which dealt with a similar case under the Equal Protection Clause. In that case, the Court held that the pregnancy exclusion divided the employees into two groups, one that was solely female and the other that contained both sexes, so the distinction is not primarily sex-based. The Court applied the same analysis to this case. Because the disability plan was not worth more to men than it was to women, it did not discriminate based on sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that this particular case had no impact on the general evidence necessary to prove a discrimination case under Title VII.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A. Blackmun wrote an opinion concurring in part where he argued that he agreed with the majority’s opinion on the merits of this case but did not agree in any inference that this case would affect overall Title VII decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion where he argued that the majority examined the policy in isolation, when it should have considered the policy in light of General Electric Co.’s history of downgrading the role of women in the workforce. Under that framework, the policy was clearly not gender-neutral. He also argued that the political background for this issue indicated that pregnancy exclusions in disability pay drastically affected women’s abilities to remain in the workforce. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the Geduldig case should not be the basis for this decision, because the Equal Protection Clause did not contain the word “discrimination.” He found that the language of Title VII required a different analysis than the one the majority used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42933,"name":"Theophil C.

The defendants argued that two sets of documents, the Adult Authority files and the Prisoners’ files, which contained personal information, were irrelevant, confidential, and privileged information that should not be admissible into evidence. The district court ordered the production of the documents; however, the court limited the number of people associated with the prisoners who could examine those documents and only allowed access to the counsel and no more than two investigators designated by the counsel. The defendants filed a writ of mandamus requesting that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacate the decision to compel discovery, but the appellate court denied the petition because the prisoners had no absolute privilege that would allow them to avoid production of the documents at issue. However, the petitioners were allowed to have their request for in camera review, or private review, considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a writ of mandamus be issued when prisoners suing the district court wish to have the petition for discovery vacated?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion for the 8-0 majority. The Court held that since less extreme alternatives for modification of the challenged discovery orders were available, the writ of mandamus was inappropriate. A writ of mandamus should only be issued in extraordinary circumstances when there are no other adequate means to secure relief. In this case, adequate alternatives existed, such as the prison officials’ opportunity to assert a separate privilege more specifically and have their request for in camera review considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33925,"name":"Karl S.

Wade\u003c/em\u003e, the State of Missouri passed a law regulating abortions in the state. Planned Parenthood of Missouri and two doctors who supervised abortions at Planned Parenthood sued to prevent enforcement of certain parts of the law. The challenged parts of the law: (1) define “viability” as the “stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life support systems”; (2) require a women submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to sign a consent form certifying that she was not coerced; (3) require written consent from the woman’s spouse during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unless the abortion will save the mother’s life; (4)require parental consent if the woman is younger than 18; (5) require physicians to exercise professional care in preserving a fetus life or risk being charged with manslaughter; (6) declare an infant who survives an abortion attempt as a ward of the state, depriving mother and father of parental rights; (7) prohibit saline amniocenteses after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy; and (8) require reporting and record keeping for facilities and physicians that perform abortions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court upheld all of the provisions except 4, holding that it was overbroad because it did not exclude the stage of pregnancy before the fetus is viable. The Supreme Court head this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre the challenged provisions of the Missouri law regulating abortion unconstitutional?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes in part. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the majority opinion, reversing in part and remanding. The Court followed the three-trimester framework laid out in \u003cem\u003eRoe v. Wade\u003c/em\u003e. The Supreme Court held that provisions 1, 2 and 8 were constitutional. Provisions 3 and 4 were unconstitutional because the state cannot delegate the authority to prevent an abortion to anyone but the physician and the woman during the first trimester of pregnancy. Provision 5 was unconstitutional because it required physicians to preserve the life of the fetus at any stage of pregnancy. Provision 7 was unconstitutional because it failed to regulate in reference to the mother’s health, and instead was designed to prohibit most abortions after 12 weeks. The Court refused to consider provision 6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart concurred, expressing that the mother’s consent provision was constitutional because not prevents a state from ensuring that the abortion decision is made knowingly and voluntarily. The parental consent provision was unconstitutional places a potential prohibition on abortion for women under 18. The spousal consent provision was also unconstitutional because the woman’s right to make the decision outweighed a father’s right to associate with his offspring. Justice Lewis F. Powell joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White concurred in part and dissented in part, arguing that the physician care provision was constitutional because the state can require a physician to preserve the life of a fetus once it is viable. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in Justice White’s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Paul Stevens concurred in part and dissented in part, arguing that prohibiting saline amniocenteses was unconstitutional because it essentially prohibited abortions after the first trimester. The parental consent provision was constitutional because the state has an interest in protecting the welfare of its young citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24566,"name":"Frank Susman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/frank_susman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Susman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"frank_susman"},"advocate_description":"","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/10326"},{"advocate":{"ID":30074,"name":"John C.

In extreme criminal cases, such as when a defendant has been convicted of deliberately killing another, the careful and judicious use of the death penalty may be appropriate if carefully employed. Georgia\u0027s death penalty statute assures the judicious and careful use of the death penalty by requiring a bifurcated proceeding where the trial and sentencing are conducted separately, specific jury findings as to the severity of the crime and the nature of the defendant, and a comparison of each capital sentence\u0027s circumstances with other similar cases. Moreover, the Court was not prepared to overrule the Georgia legislature\u0027s finding that capital punishment serves as a useful deterrent to future capital crimes and an appropriate means of social retribution against its most serious offenders.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38778,"name":"Robert H.
