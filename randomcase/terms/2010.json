Under the Federal Employers\u0027 Liability Act, a rail carrier is liable for worker injuries that result from negligence by the carrier. A trial judge instructed the jury that CSX caused or contributed to McBride\u0027s injury if its negligence \"played a part, no matter how small, in bringing about the injury.\" The jury found for McBride and awarded him $184,250.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCSX argued that McBride should have been required to prove that the company\u0027s alleged negligence was a cause of the injury. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit disagreed, affirming the verdict.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Federal Employers\u0027 Liability Act require proof of proximate causation?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"The charge proper in FELA cases, we hold, simply tracks the language Congress employed, informing juries that a defendant railroad caused or contributed to a plaintiff employee\u0027s injury if the railroad\u0027s negligence played any part in bringing about the injury,\" Ginsburg wrote for the majority. Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito. \"The Court is wrong to dispense with that familiar element of an action seeking recovery for negligence, an element \u0027generally thought to be a necessary limitation on liability,\u0027\" Roberts wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19917,"name":"Charles A.

Hannah has continued to suffer from residual seizure disorder that requires her to receive constant care, according to her parents. When their daughter was three-years-old, Russell and Robalee Bruesewitz filed a petition seeking compensation for her injuries. One month prior to the petition, new regulations eliminated Hannah\u0027s seizure disorder from the list of compensable injuries. The family\u0027s petition was denied. Three years later, in 1998, the drug company Wyeth withdrew the type of vaccine used in Hannah\u0027s inoculation from the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bruesewitzes filed a lawsuit against Wyeth in state court in Pennsylvania. They claimed the drug company failed to develop a safer vaccine and should be held accountable for preventable injuries caused by the vaccine\u0027s defective design. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act protected Wyeth from lawsuits over vaccine injury claims. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a federal law shield vaccine manufacturers from certain product liability lawsuits in state court that seek damages for serious health problems suffered by children?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court decision in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia. The majority reasoned that Congress had set up a special vaccine court as a way to provide compensation to injured children without driving drug manufacturers from the vaccine market. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a concurring opinion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20869,"name":"David C.

A grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania charged Bond with two counts of possessing and using a chemical weapon, in violation of a criminal statute implementing the treaty obligations of the United States under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. The grand jury also charged Bond with two counts of mail theft. Bond\u0027s attorneys argue that the statute was intended to deal with rogue states and terrorists and that their client should have been prosecuted under state law instead. Bond, a laboratory technician, stole the chemical potassium dichromate from the company where she worked. Haynes was not injured. Bond\u0027s husband had a child with Haynes while married to Bond. Haynes had contacted police and postal authorities after finding the chemicals at her home. In September 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that Bond lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the basis of the Tenth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a criminal defendant, who has been convicted under a federal statute, have standing to challenge the conviction on grounds that the statute is beyond the federal government\u0027s enumerated powers and inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court order in a unanimous opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy. \"Bond has standing to challenge the federal statute on grounds that the measure interferes with the powers reserved to States,\" Kennedy wrote. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer in which she argued: \"I join the Court\u0027s opinion and write separately to make the following observation. Bond, like any other defendant, has a personal right not to be convicted under a constitutionally invalid law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

Mr. Thompson served fourteen years on death row for a crime he did not commit because prosecutors failed to turn over blood work in a related case. The jury awarded Mr. Thompson $14 million against Mr. Connick in his official capacity. On appeal, an en banc U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered a tie vote and; thus by rule, affirmed the district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a prosecutor\u0027s office be held liable for the illegal conduct of one of its prosecutors, on the theory that the office failed to adequately train its employees, when there has been only one violation resulting from that deficient training?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. A divided Supreme Court held that a prosecutor\u0027s office could not be held liable for the illegal conduct of one of its prosecutors when there has been only one violation resulting from that deficient training. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion for the court. In a dissent read from the bench, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, argued that the \"what happened here, the Court\u0027s opinion obscures, was no momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone officer\u0027s misconduct.\" Instead, Ginsburg contended, evidence \"established persistent, deliberately indifferent conduct for which the District Attorney\u0027s Office bears responsibility under §1983.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia joined the majority opinion but filed a separate concurrence, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, which responded to the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41250,"name":"S.

In the latest of a long-running series of appeals and remands, a newly assigned Iowa federal district court sentenced Mr. Pepper to 77 months imprisonment and 12 months supervised release – a 20% downward departure from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines advisory range. Thereafter, the district court granted the government\u0027s motion to reduce Mr. Pepper\u0027s sentence further to 65 months imprisonment because of the assistance Mr. Pepper provided after he was initially sentenced. Mr. Pepper appealed arguing in part that the district court should consider evidence of his post-sentence rehabilitation to reduce his sentence further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Mr. Pepper\u0027s sentence, holding in part that evidence of a defendant\u0027s post-sentence rehabilitation was not relevant at resentencing. The court reasoned that Eighth Circuit precedent was clear that such evidence was not relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e1) Can a federal district judge consider a defendant\u0027s post-sentencing rehabilitation as a permissible factor supporting a sentencing variance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2) As a sentencing consideration, should post-sentencing rehabilitation be treated the same as post-offense rehabilitation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3) When a federal district judge is removed from resentencing a defendant after remand and a new judge is assigned, is the new judge obligated to follow sentencing findings issued by the original judge?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and no. The Supreme Court reversed in part, affirmed in part and remanded the case back to the lower court in a majority opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The Court held that when the defendant\u0027s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant\u0027s rehabilitation after the initial sentences; and, that evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the sentencing guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stephen J. Breyer filed a concurrence in which he agreed with the majority that the \"law does not require a sentencing court to follow a Guideline policy statement that forbids taking account of post-sentencing rehabilitation.\" He went on, however, to suggest: \"this conclusion does not leave a sentencing court free to disregard the Guidelines at will.\" Meanwhile, Justice Samuel Alito filed a partial concurrence and partial dissent, contending that \"requiring judges to give significant weight to the Commission\u0027s policy decisions does not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment right that the mandatory Guidelines system was found to violate, i.e., the right to have a jury make certain factual findings that are relevant to sentencing.\" Justice Clarence Thomas dissented in full, writing that he would have affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision and upheld Pepper\u0027s sentence. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16689,"name":"Alfredo Parrish","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/alfredo_parrish","view_count":0,"last_name":"Parrish","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"alfredo_parrish"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner (appointed by the Court)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20063"},{"advocate":{"ID":39939,"name":"Roy W.

Following the jury trial, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California sentenced Tapia to 51 months in prison, noting that one factor in giving her a longer sentence was to make sure she remained confined long enough to take part in a drug rehab program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTapia appealed the sentence, arguing that the district court committed plain error by basing her sentence on speculation about whether and when she could enter and complete the Bureau of Prison\u0027s 500-hour drug abuse treatment program.

Beginning in 1978, he worked at Millar Elevator Industries, which was later absorbed by Schindler Elevator in 2002. Although he had been promoted within the company on past occasions, in 2003, he was demoted from a managerial position to a non-managerial slot. He then resigned. Kirk filed a complaint with the Department of Labor in 2004 claiming his demotion was in violation of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act. After his claim was denied by the department, he filed suit in the Southern District of New York in 2005 under the False Claims Act. Kirk claimed the company was shirking its obligation to take affirmative steps to employ and promote veterans, invite eligible veterans to identify themselves to employers and file annual reports detailing the hiring and placement of veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing documentation supplied by FOIA requests submitted by his wife and his own knowledge of company operations, he claimed the company failed to file reports from 1998 until late 2004 and filed false reports in 2004, 2005 and 2006, alleging that each claim for payment on the hundreds of government contracts submitted by Schindler was a violation of the False Claims Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the complaint in March 2009 for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In April 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the lower court order and remanded the case for further proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a whistleblower use information obtained through FOIA to allege violations of the federal False Claims Act by a government contractor?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court order in a decision by Justice Clarence Thomas. A written response to a FOIA request for records is a report within the meaning of the False Claims Act\u0027s disclosure bar, according to the majority. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored a dissent, which was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Ginsburg wrote that she would \"affirm the Second Circuit\u0027s judgment as faithful to the text, context, purpose, and history of the FCA\u0027s public disclosure bar.\" Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41976,"name":"Steven Alan Reiss","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/steven_alan_reiss","view_count":0,"last_name":"Reiss","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"steven_alan_reiss"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20070"},{"advocate":{"ID":33664,"name":"Jonathan A.

After exhausting his post-conviction state court remedies, Mr. Moore petitioned for habeas corpus relief in an Oregon federal district court. Mr. Moore argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to recognize that his taped confession was obtained unconstitutionally. The district court denied the petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and granted the petition. The court held that Mr. Moore\u0027s counsel\u0027s failure to suppress Mr. Moore\u0027s confession was both constitutionally deficient and prejudicial under the standard set forth in \u003cem\u003eStrickland v. Washington\u003c/em\u003e. The court was careful to note that even the state conceded the means by which the state elicited Mr. Moore\u0027s confession were unconstitutional because Mr. Moore\u0027s request for counsel had been ignored by the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a lawyer provide inadequate representation by failing to seek suppression of a client\u0027s confession before he pleads no contest to murder?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The court reversed the appeals court decision, holding that defense counsel was not ineffective and that Moore was not in any event prejudiced by his counsel\u0027s actions.

Subsequently, Mr. Martin filed a round of habeas petitions in state court – all of which were denied. He then raised several new claims in petitions for federal habeas relief in a California federal district court. The court denied to examine the claims because they were not yet exhausted in state court. After Mr. Martin exhausted these last claims in state court, he returned to federal court for federal habeas corpus relief. The district court again denied the petition relying on California\u0027s statute of limitations for filing state habeas corpus petitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that California\u0027s statute of limitations could not operate as an independent and adequate state ground to bar federal habeas corpus review. The court reasoned that California\u0027s statute of limitations was not sufficiently defined, nor consistently applied such that it could bar Mr. Martin\u0027s petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn a federal habeas corpus proceeding, is a state law barring a prisoner from attacking his conviction an insufficient procedural bar because the federal court thinks the rule is (1) vague and (2) the state failed to prove that the bar is consistently applied?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision in a unanimous opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Court held that the California rule requiring state habeas petitions to be filed \"as promptly as the circumstances allow\" constitutes an independent state ground that is adequate to bar habeas relief in federal court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43114,"name":"Todd Marshall","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/todd_marshall","view_count":0,"last_name":"Marshall","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"todd_marshall"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20082"},{"advocate":{"ID":35489,"name":"Michael B.

During the police shoot-out that followed, Mitts shot and killed one police officer and wounded two others before being apprehended. At trial, Mitts did not contest the evidence proving that he had killed two men, but he instead attempted to establish that he was too intoxicated to form the required intent to kill.

The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed Mitts\u0027 convictions and sentences, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentences and denied rehearing, ruling that the trial court should have instructed the jury to merge duplicative death penalty specifications, but holding that the error did not influence the jury and was resolved by re-weighing on appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitts filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

They were charged with child abuse and felony torture, but the charges were dismissed once it became clear the allegations were not true. Despite the fact that the charges were dismissed, the Humphries were placed on California\u0027s Child Abuse Central Index (\"CACI\") – a database for known and suspected child abusers. The Humphries subsequently filed suit against Los Angeles County and various County officials in a California federal district court. The Humphries argued that California\u0027s maintenance of the CACI violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because identified individuals are not given fair opportunity to challenge the allegations against them. The district court dismissed their claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed holding that the erroneous listing of the Humphries on the CACI violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Humphries, as the prevailing party, then moved for attorneys\u0027 fees. The Ninth Circuit awarded the fees, reasoning that the limitations to liability established in \u003cem\u003eMonell v. Department of Social Services\u003c/em\u003e do not apply to claims for declaratory relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre claims for declaratory relief against a local public entity subject to the requirement of \u003cem\u003eMonell\u003c/em\u003e that the plaintiff must demonstrate that the constitutional violation was the result of the policy, custom, or practice attributable to the local public entity; or are such claims exempt as determined by the Ninth Circuit?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court reversed and remanded the Ninth Circuit decision, holding that Los Angeles County does not have to pay attorneys\u0027 fees in the case. Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote the 8-0 opinion for the court, reasoned that the court\u0027s ruling in \u003cem\u003eMonell\u003c/em\u003e applies to claims against municipalities for prospective relief as well as to claims for damages. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the consideration and decision of the case because she worked on it while in the Solicitor General\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42553,"name":"Timothy T.

He was held for 16 days as a material witness in the terrorism trial of Sami Omar al-Hussayen. Al-Kidd has since argued the government classified him as a material witness because it lacked enough evidence to hold him as a suspect. He filed a lawsuit against then-Attorney General John Ashcroft personally, claiming that he created and authorized a program that allegedly misused the material witness statute to detain suspected terrorists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawsuit did not go to trial and in September 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected Ashcroft\u0027s bid for absolute immunity, holding that it didn\u0027t apply because the government\u0027s motive for arresting Al-Kidd allegedly had nothing to do with the al-Hussayen prosecution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the former government official entitled to qualified immunity from the pretext claim based on the conclusions that (a) the Fourth Amendment prohibits an officer from executing a valid material witness warrant with the intent of conducting further investigation or preventively detaining the subject; and (b) this Fourth Amendment rule was clearly established at the time of Al-Kidd\u0027s arrest?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia. \"Efficient and even-handed application of the law demands that we look to whether the arrest is objectively justified, rather than to the motive of the arresting officer,\" Scalia wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion, in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor joined as to Part I.

Subsequently, they sued Mazda Motor of America for strict products liability, negligence, deceit, and wrongful death in a California state court. The court dismissed the claims, holding that federal law precluded a state court tort action \"to the extent the theory of liability [was rooted in] the lap-only seat belt.\" On appeal, a California appellate court affirmed, holding that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") regulation allowing minivan rear seats to have either lap-only or lap/shoulder seat belts preempted state court wrongful death actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the NHTSA regulation allowing vehicle manufacturers to install either lap-only or lap/shoulder seatbelts in certain seating positions impliedly preempt a state-law claim alleging that the manufacturer should have installed lap/should seatbelts in one of its seating positions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision in a unanimous opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer.

They argued that federal law preempted LAWA, which requires Arizona employers to use the federal E-Verify employment verification system and revokes business licenses of those who hire unauthorized workers. The district court upheld the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that LAWA was not preempted explicitly or impliedly by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (\"IRCA\"). The court reasoned that IRCA although IRCA expressly preempts all state and local laws imposing sanctions for hiring or recruiting unauthorized aliens, it excepts licensing laws – like LAWA – from preemptive reach. The court also reasoned that mandating the use of E-Verify is not impliedly preempted by IRCA because Congress could have, but did not, expressly forbid states form requiring E-Verify participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAn Arizona law requires state employers to check the immigration status of job applicants through a federal computer database, although the federal law creating the database makes its use voluntary. Arizona also revokes the business license of state companies that hire undocumented workers. Are these provisions pre-empted by federal immigration laws?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court holding in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts. \"Arizona\u0027s licensing law falls well within the confines of the authority Congress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not expressly preempted.\" All five members of the majority did not join the chief justice\u0027s opinion in full. Meanwhile, Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"Congress did not intend its \u0027licensing\u0027 language to create so broad an exemption, for doing so would permit States to eviscerate the federal Act\u0027s preemption provision,\" Breyer wrote. Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored a separate dissent in which she contended that she \"would also hold that federal law pre-empts the provision of the Arizona Act making mandatory the use of E-Verify, the federal electronic verification system.\" The Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19760,"name":"Carter G.

(\"CSX\") brought suit against the Alabama Department of Revenue in an Alabama federal district court seeking an injunction to prevent the imposition of the state\u0027s sales and use tax on diesel fuel. CSX argued that the tax discriminates against railroad companies in violate of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (\"RRRR\"). The district court had granted a preliminary injunction, but of its own accord, dissolved the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that the district court appropriately dismissed the action.

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer.

Justice Antonin Scalia filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas joined. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case. \" I agree with the judgment of the Court in Part II that a pretrial motion need not actually postpone a trial, or create an expectation of postponement, in order for its pendency to be excluded under the Speedy Trial Act….

The charges stemmed from the alleged molestation of his two step-daughters. A judge on the state superior court sentenced Kholi to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment, and the state supreme court affirmed the conviction in February 1996. Kholi did not file a federal writ of habeas corpus at that time. Instead, he filed a motion seeking sentence reduction as a form of post-conviction relief, which was denied. Kholi exhausted his procedural options regarding sentence reduction in 2007, at which time he began his appeal for federal writ of habeas corpus, which was well beyond the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u0027s standard one-year limitation on filing. In September 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and remanded the district court\u0027s judgment that a petition for leniency is different from an appeal to correct legal errors and therefore does not result in a tolling of the statute of limitations under AEDPA. A circuit split exists on the issue. The First Circuit\u0027s decision was in line with a Tenth Circuit ruling on the same issue, but the Third, Fourth and Eleventh Circuits have previously ruled that a petition for leniency does not toll the statute of limitations under AEDPA.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eInmates have one year to file a habeas challenge to their sentence in federal court after conviction. The running of that time is delayed while the conviction is under review in state court. Is the time also tolled while a state court considers an inmate\u0027s request for a sentence reduction?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court decision in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito. \"Because the parties agree that a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the direct review process, we hold that respondent\u0027s motion tolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal habeas petition was therefore timely,\" Alito wrote for the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Antonin Scalia wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment but disagreeing with \"Footnote 3 of the Court\u0027s opinion, which declines to decide whether a Rule 35 motion seeks direct review.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17286,"name":"Aaron L.

VOPA alleged that the officials violated two federal statutes when the officials refused VOPA access to state records which VOPA argued it was entitled. The officials moved to dismiss the case arguing that they were immune to suit under the Eleventh Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the state officials were immune to suit under the Eleventh Amendment. The court reasoned that: (1) Congress did not abrogate state immunity under the statutes which VOPA sued under and (2) the mere receipt of federal funds by Virginia under the two statutes did not mean that the state had consented to suit. The court declined to extend the Eleventh Amendment exception established in \u003cem\u003eEx parte Young\u003c/em\u003e, where a private party may seek prospective injunctive relief against state officials, noting that VOPA was not a private party but rather a state agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Eleventh Amendment categorically preclude an independent state agency from bringing an action in federal court against state officials for prospective injunctive relief to remedy a violation of federal law under the doctrine of \u003cem\u003eEx Parte Young\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. \" \u003cem\u003eEx parte Young\u003c/em\u003e allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for prospective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the same state,\" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the 6-2 majority. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Roberts wrote that he disagreed with the majority\u0027s \"substantial and novel expansion of what we have also called a \u0027narrow exception\u0027 to a State\u0027s sovereign immunity.\" Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion, which was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41355,"name":"Seth M.

In the controlling opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted: \"In my view, the term of imprisonment imposed by a district court pursuant to an agreement authorized by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) is \u0027based on\u0027 the agreement itself, not on the judge\u0027s calculation of the Sentencing Guidelines.\" Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. \"I agree with the concurrence that the sentence imposed under a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is based on the agreement, not the Sentencing Guidelines,\" Roberts wrote. \"I would, however, adhere to that logic regardless whether the agreement could be said to \u0027use\u0027 or \u0027employ\u0027 a Guidelines range in arriving at the particular sentence specified in the agreement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":24092,"name":"Frank W.

Three years later, the Navy and then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney declared the company in default and canceled the contract. The government has argued that the companies weren\u0027t able to produce the aircraft as designed on schedule and is seeking repayment of $1.35 billion, plus more than $2.5 billion in accumulated interest, arguing that the companies failed to meet the terms of the contract. Meanwhile, General Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Co., which inherited the litigation through its purchase of McDonnell Douglas, contend that the delay was caused by the government\u0027s refusal to share essential stealth technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has argued that the companies couldn\u0027t press that argument because litigating the issue would require the disclosure of military secrets and jeopardize national security. Two lower courts agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eThe \"state secrets\" doctrine prevents disclosure of important state secrets in litigation. Can the government sue a federal contractor for breach of contract then use the state secrets doctrine to prevent the contractor from raising a defense that would require the contractor to disclose secret information?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court order in a unanimous decision by Justice Antonin Scalia. The court held that neither the government nor the defense contractors could pursue the long-running dispute because of the possibility that state secrets might be revealed. \"Suit on the contract, or for performance rendered or funds paid under the contract, will not lie, and the parties will be left where they are,\" Scalia wrote. \"Both parties—the government no less than petitioners—must have assumed the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication of claims of inadequate performance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19760,"name":"Carter G.

Washington\u003c/em\u003e the defendant must show that \"counsel\u0027s performance was deficient.\" And, the defendant must show that \"the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\" Here, the requirements of \u003cem\u003eStrickland\u003c/em\u003e were met when Mr. Richter\u0027s counsel failed to conduct sufficient pre-trial investigation to determine what forensic evidence or experts would be useful to the defense\u0027s theory when it was foreseeable what evidence the state would introduce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a defense lawyer deficient for failing to consult blood evidence when planning strategy for trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Reversing the lower court order, the court held that the defense lawyer was not deficient in failing to consult blood evidence when planning strategy for trial. Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the opinion, which was joined by eight of the justices with Justice Elena Kagan taking no part in the consideration of the case. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26690,"name":"Harry Joseph Colombo","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/harry_j_colombo","view_count":0,"last_name":"Colombo","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"harry_j_colombo"},"advocate_description":"Deputy Attorney General of California, for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20125"},{"advocate":{"ID":18968,"name":"Clifford Gardner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/clifford_gardner","view_count":0,"last_name":"Gardner","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"clifford_gardner"},"advocate_description":"for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20126"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":22706,"title":"Oral Argument - October 12, 2010","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/22706"}],"citation":{"volume":"562","page":"86","year":"2011","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/19674"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15086,"name":"John G.

After CIGNA converted its traditional defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan, it issued a summary plan description to plan participants. In 2001, Janice Amara, one of the participants, filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming that CIGNA failed to comply with ERISA\u0027s notice requirements and SPD provisions. The U.S. District Court for the District Connecticut found for Amara, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, finding that the SPD misrepresented the terms of the plan itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court have authority under Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA to reform CIGNA\u0027s pension plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the lower court order, finding that while the district court did not have authority under Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA to reform CIGNA\u0027s pension plan, it did have authority to do so under another provision, Section 502(a)(3). In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Court noted that \"although §502(a)(1)(B) did not give the District Court authority to reform CIGNA\u0027s plan, relief is authorized by §502(a)(3), which allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary \u0027to obtain other appropriate equitable relief\u0027 to redress violations of ERISA \u0027or the [plan\u0027s] terms.\u0027\" Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas concurred only in the judgment.

The police had learned that the boy was in possession of a digital camera that had been reported stolen.The boy was escorted to a school conference room, where he was interrogated in the presence of school officials. J.D.B.\u0027s parents were not contacted, and he was not given any warnings about his rights under the 1966 decision in \u003cem\u003eMiranda v. Arizona\u003c/em\u003e, such as the right to remain silent or to have access to a lawyer. J.D.B. confessed to the crimes, but later sought to have his confession suppressed on the basis that he was never read his Miranda rights. He argued that because he was effectively in police custody when he incriminated himself, he was entitled to Miranda protections. In December 2009, the North Carolina Supreme Court held that it could not consider the boy\u0027s age or special education status in determining whether he was in custody, and because he was not in custody, he was not entitled to Miranda warnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould courts consider the age of a juvenile suspect in deciding whether he or she is in custody for \u003cem\u003eMiranda\u003c/em\u003e purposes?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. A divided Supreme Court reversed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the state court to determine whether the youth was in custody when he was interrogated. (1966). \"It is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel free to leave. Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a child\u0027s age properly informs the \u003cem\u003eMiranda\u003c/em\u003e custody analysis,\" Sotomayor wrote for the majority. Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. \"The Court\u0027s decision in this case may seem on first consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it is neither, Alito writes. \"It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main justifications for the \u003cem\u003eMiranda\u003c/em\u003e rule: the perceived need for a clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases. And today\u0027s holding is not needed to protect the constitutional rights of minors who are questioned by the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17489,"name":"Barbara S.

While Ms. Ortiz served her sentence, she was sexually abused by a corrections officer on two consecutive nights. Prior to the second incident, Ms. Ortiz complained to prison officials, but was told \"that the man was leaving,\" \"this was his nature,\" and he \"is just an old dirty man.\" The corrections officer assaulted her on the following night. At trial, the jury found in favor of Ms. Ortiz against two of the prison officials – Paula Jordan and Rebecca Bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity and dismissed the case. The court noted that while courts do not normally review the denial of summary judgment after a trial on the merits, a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to the general rule. The court reasoned that Ms. Jordan\u0027s conduct did not violate Ms. Ortiz\u0027s Eight Amendment right to humane conditions because Ms. Jordan was not \"deliberately indifferent\" to Ms. Ortiz\u0027s plight.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a party appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits if the party chose not to appeal the order before trial?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court order in a unanimous opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which held that a party may not appeal a denial of summary judgment after a district court has conducted a full trial on the merits.

The chapter 13 trustee and two creditors objected to confirmation of the plan, arguing that $500 per month was not Ransom\u0027s projected disposable income as defined in the Bankruptcy Code. They argued that Ransom improperly included a deduction against income for \"vehicle ownership expense\" of $471. The trustee and creditors claimed that the deduction should be disallowed and that the monthly payment should be increased. The Bankruptcy Court agreed with the trustee and refused to confirm the plan. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, agreeing to hear the appeal on this interlocutory issue, affirmed the Bankruptcy Court.

Stanford School of Medicine professor Mark Holodniy developed the technology behind the kits. As a researcher at the university, patents from his work would normally be automatically assigned to Stanford. The 1980 Bayh-Dole Act allows universities to retain the rights to research funded by federal grants. But Holodniy also signed a contract with Cetus Corp., a company that later sold its line of business to Roche, that give the company the patent to anything that resulted from their collaboration. In February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the university lacked standing to maintain patent infringement claims against Roche.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust patents on inventions that arise from federally-funded research go to the university where the inventor worked?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order in a decision by Chief Justice John Roberts. \"The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions,\" Roberts wrote for the majority. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion, noting that while she agrees with them majority that \"the appropriate disposition is to affirm. Like the dissent, however, I understand the majority opinion to permit consideration of these arguments in a future case.\" Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Mr. Flores-Villar argued that the relevant provisions of the INA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the basis of age and gender. The provisions impose a five-year residency requirement, after age fourteen, on United States citizen fathers but not mothers, whose residency requirement is merely one year. The Ninth Circuit applied the Supreme Court\u0027s holding in \u003cem\u003eNguyen v. INS\u003c/em\u003e which did not deal precisely with the provisions before the court, but held that other more onerous residency requirements for fathers but not mothers in the INA did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court concluded that the provisions challenged by Mr. Flores-Villar also did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and affirmed the judgment of the district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes \u003cem\u003eNguyen v.

SEB owns a patent for a type of deep fryer with an inexpensive plastic outer shell. The improvement of the patent was to separate the shell from the fryer pan to allow for the less expensive material. Hong Kong-based Pentalpha Enterprises, a subsidiary of Global-Tech Appliances, a British Virgin Islands corporation, began selling its deep fryers to Sunbeam Products Inc. in 1997. The company developed the product after purchasing an SEB deep fryer and copying its features. Though Pentalpha solicited and received a \"right-to-use study\" from a U.S. attorney citing no infringement of any patent, the company had failed to notify the attorney of the copying. SEB filed a lawsuit against Sunbeam and the companies settled. Though Pentalpha was aware of that litigation, it subsequently sold the same deep fryers to Fingerhut Corp. and Montgomery Ward \u0026amp; Co. In 1999, SEB sued Montgomery Ward, Global-Tech, and Pentalpha for infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which ruled against Pentalpha. In February 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court decision and further held that \"deliberate indifference\" to potential patent rights satisfies the knowledge requirement for induced infringement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes induced infringement under the patent clause require knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court holding in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito. \"Induced infringement under §271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement,\" Alito wrote for the majority. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented, contending that the majority is \"incorrect in the definition it now adopts; but even on its own terms the Court should remand to the Court of Appeals to consider in the first instance whether there is sufficient evidence of knowledge to support the jury\u0027s finding of inducement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44523,"name":"William Dunnegan","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/william_dunnegan","view_count":0,"last_name":"Dunnegan","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"william_dunnegan"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20164"},{"advocate":{"ID":38986,"name":"R.

The State introduced a blood alcohol test (blood draw) that was taken from Bullcoming under a search warrant issued following his refusal of the breath alcohol test. Bullcoming argued that the laboratory report of his blood draw results was testimonial evidence subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New Mexico Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, and upheld the trial court\u0027s ruling that the forensic report was a business record. The court ruled that a blood alcohol report is admissible as a public record and that it presented no issue under the Confrontation Clause because the report was non-testimonial. The New Mexico Supreme Court granted discretionary review, but while the case was pending, this U.S. Supreme Court issued its 2009 decision in \u003cem\u003eMelendez-Diaz v.Massachusetts\u003c/em\u003e, clarifying that forensic laboratory reports are testimonial and therefore the Sixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to prove its case via ex parte out-of-court affidavits. In applying the \u003cem\u003eMelendez-Diaz\u003c/em\u003e ruling, the New Mexico Supreme Court held that the blood alcohol report was testimonial evidence, but it was admissible even though the forensic analyst who performed the test did not testify.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a blood-alcohol test admitted without the actual testimony of the person who prepared the results violate a criminal defendant\u0027s Sixth Amendment rights under the Confrontation Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"The Confrontation Clause does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification,\" Ginsburg wrote, adding: \"The accused\u0027s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification.\" Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined all but Part 4 of the opinion; Justice Clarence Thomas joined all but Part 4 and Footnote 6. Sotomayor concurred in part, writing: \"I agree with the Court that the trial court erred by admitting the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) report. I write separately first to highlight why I view the report at issue to be testimonial—specifically because its \u0027primary purpose\u0027 is evidentiary—and second to emphasize the limited reach of the Court\u0027s opinion.\" Meanwhile, Anthony Kennedy dissented, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito. \"Far from replacing live testimony with \u0027systematic\u0027 and \u0027extrajudicial\u0027 examinations, these procedures are fully consistent with the Confrontation Clause and with well-established principles for ensuring that criminal trials are conducted in full accord with requirements of fairness and reliability and with the confrontation guarantee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30283,"name":"Jeffrey L.

The girl\u0027s father, Nimrod Greene, was arrested for allegedly molesting a 7-year-old boy. The boy\u0027s mother told police that Sarah Greene had complained that she \"doesn\u0027t like the way Nimrod makes (his daughters) sleep in his bed when he is intoxicated and she doesn\u0027t like the way he acts when they are sitting in his lap.\" After interviewing one of the girls, Camreta concluded that she had been sexually abused and had the girls removed from the home. Nimrod was charged with sexually assaulting the boy and one of his own daughters. After a mistrial, he accepted a plea bargain in which he maintained his innocence but admitted there was enough evidence to convict him. Greene insisted the allegations were lies, and the daughter who was interviewed later recanted her statements. District Court Judge Ann Aiken of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed the lawsuit. In December 2009, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partially reversed, allowing Greene to pursue her Fourth Amendment claims against both defendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment require a warrant, a court order or parental consent before law enforcement and child welfare officials may conduct a temporary seizure and interview at a public school of a child whom they reasonably suspect was being sexually abused?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court declined to address the Fourth Amendment question in the case. \"We conclude that this Court generally may review a lower court\u0027s constitutional ruling at the behest of a government official granted immunity. But we may not do so in this case for reasons peculiar to it. The case has become moot because the child has grown up and moved across the country, and so will never again be subject to the Oregon in-school interviewing practices whose constitutionality is at issue,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the majority. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a concurring opinion and Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Stephen Breyer joined. \"I agree with the Court\u0027s conclusion that this case is moot and that vacatur is the appropriate disposition; unlike the majority, however, I would go no further,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"The majority suggests that we must decide whether Camreta has a \u0027right to appeal\u0027 in order to vacate the judgment below. But that view does not accord with our past practice.\" Meanwhile, Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Clarence Thomas joined. \"The correct solution is not to override jurisdictional rules that are basic to the functioning of the Court and to the necessity of avoiding advisory opinions,\" Kennedy argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31312,"name":"John R.

He was also found guilty of distributing more than 50 grams of cocaine base, which carries a 10-year minimum sentence. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release. In March 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the sentence, citing its past precedent. The opinion also notes that the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Circuits also interpret the statute the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the term \"cocaine base\" encompass every form of cocaine that is classified chemically as a base, or is the term \"cocaine base\" limited to \"crack\" cocaine?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.

The officers lost sight of the suspect and mistakenly assumed he entered an apartment from which they could detect the odor of marijuana. After police knocked on the door and identified themselves, they heard movements, which they believed indicated evidence was about to be destroyed. Police forcibly entered the apartment and found Hollis King and others smoking marijuana. They also found cash, drugs and paraphernalia. King entered a conditional guilty plea; reserving his right to appeal denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from what he argued was an illegal search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that exigent circumstances supporting the warrantless search were not of the police\u0027s making and that police did not engage in deliberate and intentional conduct to evade the warrant requirement. In January 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the lower court order, finding that the entry was improper. The court held that the police were not in pursuit of a fleeing suspect when they entered the apartment, since there was no evidence that the original suspect even knew he was being followed by police.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the exclusionary rule, which forbids the use of illegally seized evidence except in emergency situations, apply when the emergency is created by lawful police actions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court order in a decision by Justice Samuel Alito. \"The exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment,\" Alito wrote for the majority. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, contending that \"the Court today arms the police with a way routinely to dishonor the Fourth Amendment\u0027s warrant requirement in drug cases. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30348,"name":"Joshua D.

A British company manufactured the machine and sold it through its exclusive U.S. distributor. Nicastro sued J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd., the British company, and its U.S. distributor, McIntyre Machinery America, Ltd., in New Jersey state court for product liability.

But this case does not present any of those issues. So I think it unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without full consideration of the modern-day consequences.\" Meanwhile, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. \"Inconceivable as it may have seemed yesterday, the splintered majority today \u0027turn[s] the clock back to the days before modern long-arm statutes when a manufacturer, to avoid being haled into court where a user is injured, need only Pilate-like wash its hands of a product by having independent distributors market it.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":15968,"name":"Arthur F.

The investors alleged that Matrixx failed to disclose that one of its products, Zicam nasal spray/gel, caused anosmia (the loss of the sense of smell) in numerous customers. The district court dismissed the case holding that the investors failed to alleged \"materiality\" in their claim because their evidence was not \"statistically significant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the investors had pled sufficient facts going to the issue of materiality in order to avoid dismissal. The court reasoned that whether facts are statistically significant, and thus, material, is a question of fact that should ordinarily be left to the trier of fact – usually the jury.

In 2007, Montana sued Wyoming, alleging farmers and other water users along the Powder and Tongue rivers were being harmed by Wyoming\u0027s excessive water use. Attorneys for Wyoming argued that much of the water used by the state\u0027s residents and businesses was not covered by the 1950 agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial Master Barton Thompson issued an interim report, finding that Montana had grounds to sue over Wyoming\u0027s expanded use of water since 1950. However, Thompson rejected Montana\u0027s claim that Wyoming should be held liable for increased water use due to irrigation improvements. Meanwhile, North Dakota, also a member of the Yellowstone compact, was named as a second defendant in the original lawsuit.

A month later, someone accused Fox of uttering a racial slur and, at Vice\u0027s instigation, filed a false police report regarding Fox\u0027s alleged use of the term. Fox brought a civil rights suit against Vice and the town in state court in December 2005, asserting both state and federal claims, and the case was removed to federal court in January 2006. Separately, in April 2007, Vice was tried and found guilty of extortion in state criminal court for the anonymous letter. In 2007, in response to a motion filed by the defendants, Fox admitted that he had failed to properly present any federal cause of action, so the district court dismissed Fox\u0027s federal claims with prejudice and remanded the remaining state law claims to state court. The district court then granted the defendants\u0027 motion for attorneys\u0027 fees, finding that Fox\u0027s federal claims were frivolous, unreasonable and without foundation. Fox appealed the fee award to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and in a split decision the appeals court affirmed the district court\u0027s order.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a court award attorneys\u0027 fees to civil rights defendants based on a dismissal of a claim when the plaintiff has asserted other nonfrivolous claims?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the lower court order in a unanimous opinion by Justice Elena Kagan. \"When a plaintiff\u0027s suit involves both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant, but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims,\" Kagan wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23018,"name":"E.

Regalado filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in September 2002, alleging that her supervisors discriminated against her based on her gender. On February 13, 2003, the EEOC notified North American Stainless of the charge. Slightly more than three weeks later, North American Stainless terminated Thompson\u0027s employment. Thompson filed a complaint, which alleged that he was fired in retaliation for Regalado\u0027s EEOC charge. Retaliating in that way, Thompson asserted, violated section 704(a) of Title VII, which forbids an employer to \"discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has... made a charge ... under this title.\" The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky dismissed Thompson\u0027s complaint, holding that Title VII \"does not permit third party retaliation claims.\" A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the lower court order. But the court of appeals granted the employer\u0027s petition for rehearing en banc. A splintered en banc court upheld the dismissal of Thompson\u0027s complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an employer violate an anti-retaliation provision of a federal civil rights statute by firing the fiancée of the employee who complained about discrimination? Can the fired employee sue, or only the employee who filed the complaint?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court order in a unanimous opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, which held that Title VII\u0027s anti-retaliation provision must be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct, including Thompson\u0027s cause of action. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion, which was joined by Justice Stephen Breyer. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23226,"name":"Eric Schnapper","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/eric_schnapper","view_count":0,"last_name":"Schnapper","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"eric_schnapper"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20198"},{"advocate":{"ID":34700,"name":"Leondra R.

Mr. Kasten filed suit under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") in a Wisconsin federal district court alleging that he was retaliated against for filing complaints about the legality of the location of Saint- Gobain\u0027s time clocks. Mr. Kasten alleges that the location of the time clocks prevented employees from being paid for time spent donning and doffing their required protective gear. Saint-Gobain motioned for summary judgment arguing that purely verbal complaints, like those made by Mr. Kasten, were not protected activity under the FLSA. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the case. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that unwritten, purely verbal complaints are not protected activity under the FLSA.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eThe Fair Labor Standards Act protects employees from retaliation for complaining about violations of the statute. Does the protection apply only if the complaint is in writing?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court decision in an opinion by Justice Stephen G. Breyer. The majority held that the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to a complaint, whether oral or written. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. \"The retaliation provision contemplates an official grievance filed with a court or an agency, not oral complaints—or even formal, written complaints — from an employee to an employer,\" Scalia argued. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31260,"name":"James H.

The lawsuit also alleged \"gross mismanagement\" by the federal government. One day later, the tribe filed a similar complaint against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages for the earnings shortfall in its trust accounts. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the lawsuit because a similar claim was being heard by a different court in violation of 28 U.S.C. § 1500. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the CFC\u0027s dismissal of the case, concluding, \"the Nation\u0027s complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeks relief that is different from the relief sought in its earlier-filed district court action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eA federal statute provides that the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction to hear a suit against the federal government raising a claim that is already being litigated against the government in another court. Does this provision apply when the plaintiff brings a lawsuit in both the Court of Federal Claims and another court based on the same set of facts, but seeks different forms of relief in the two cases?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court order in a decision by Justice Anthony Kennedy. \"The Court of Appeals was wrong to allow its precedent to suppress the statute\u0027s aims,\" Kennedy wrote for the majority. \"The conclusion that two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are based on substantially the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve its aim.\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which she argued: \"To avoid both duplication and the running of the statute of limitations, the CFC suit could be stayed while the companion District Court action proceeds.\" Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17293,"name":"Anthony A.

The lawsuit alleged that the utility companies, which operate facilities in 21 states, are a public nuisance because their carbon-dioxide emissions contribute to global warming. American Electric Power Co. and the other utilities argued that the courts should not get involved in the issue. The companies contended that only the Environmental Protection Agency can set emissions standards. A federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York initially threw out the case, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said it could continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe states in the lawsuit are: California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.

The certified class, which in 2001 was estimated to comprise more than 1.5 million women, includes all women employed by Wal-Mart nationwide at any time after December 26, 1998, making this the largest class action lawsuit in U.S. history. Wal-Mart has argued that the court should require employees to file on an individual basis, contending that class actions of this size – formed under Rule 23(b) of the federal rules of civil procedure — are inherently unmanageable and unduly costly. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has three times upheld the class certification.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the small group of women who began the case represent a gigantic class of women?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court order in a unanimous opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia. \"Here, proof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents\u0027 merits contention that Wal-Mart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination. The crux of a Title VII inquiry is \u0027the reason for a particular employment decision,\u0027 and respondents wish to sue for millions of employment decisions at once,\" Scalia wrote. \"Without some glue holding together the alleged reasons for those decisions, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members\u0027 claims will produce a common answer to the crucial discrimination question.\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred in part and dissented in part, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. \"Whether the class the plaintiffs describe meets the specific requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) is not before the Court, and I would reserve that matter for consideration and decision on remand,\" Ginsburg wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42418,"name":"Theodore J.

Staub was also a lab technician at Proctor Hospital in Peoria, Ill. He was fired in 2004 and later filed a lawsuit claiming that his supervisor was out to get him as a result of disapproval of his military service. He won $57,640 in damages at trial. But a more senior executive, not the supervisor, ultimately decided to fire Staub. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that there was no evidence that the decision-maker shared the supervisor\u0027s anti-military bias.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan an employer be found liable for the discriminatory acts of supervisors, who do not themselves make employment decisions but do influence the employment decision-makers?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision in a unanimous decision announced by Justice Antonin Scalia. \"If a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable,\" wrote Scalia. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, concurred in the judgment but wrote that he would hold employers liable if the person making the firing decision \"merely rubberstamps\" a biased supervisor\u0027s recommendation or when the decision-maker is \"put on notice that adverse information about an employee may be based on antimilitary animus but does not undertake an independent investigation of the matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23226,"name":"Eric Schnapper","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/eric_schnapper","view_count":0,"last_name":"Schnapper","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"eric_schnapper"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/20215"},{"advocate":{"ID":22857,"name":"Eric D.

Under early interpretations of the law, incumbent-constructed entrance facilities had to provide at-cost access to the competitors. In AT\u0026amp;T Inc. unit Michigan Bell Telephone Co.\u0027s interpretation, the FCC\u0027s Triennial Review Remand Order in 2005 created a means to charge for the use of the facilities, and the company announced plans to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompetitor carriers complained to the Michigan Public Service Commission, and it ruled that the entrance facilities should still be provided at cost. Michigan Bell sued in federal court and won. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes federal law require local telephone companies, already established, to allow new competitors in their markets to link to the existing networks through connecting wires at low, government-regulated rates?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed the opinion of the lower court in a decision by Justice Clarence Thomas. \"The FCC has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regulations — i.e., that to satisfy its duty under §251(c)(2), an incumbent LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competitors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnection — and this Court defers to the FCC\u0027s views,\" Thomas wrote. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a concurring opinion, noting: \"I would reach the same result even without benefit of the rule that we will defer to an agency\u0027s interpretation of its own regulations.\" Meanwhile, Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29018,"name":"John J.

J. Howard Marshall\u0027s will left nearly all his money to his son, E. Pierce Marshall, and nothing to (now deceased wife) Anna Nicole Smith, aka Vickie Lynn Marshall. The younger Marshall died in 2006 and Smith died of a drug overdose in 2007. Smith had previously fought the will, claiming that her husband promised to leave her more than $300 million. Howard K. Stern, Smith\u0027s former attorney and boyfriend, has continued the legal battle on behalf of Smith\u0027s estate. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Marshall was mentally fit and under no undue pressure when he wrote a will leaving nearly all of his $1.6 billion estate to his son and nothing to Smith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court will revisit the estate battle four years after the justices sent the case back to lower courts for further review. In the earlier case, the court only addressed whether or not federal courts can rule on Smith\u0027s claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a creditor files a claim in bankruptcy court, the debtor is sometimes required to file any counterclaim she may have or lose the right to assert that claim later or in another court. Can a bankruptcy judge conclusively resolve such compulsory counterclaims?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eConclusion: No. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts. \"Although the Bankruptcy Court had the statutory authority to enter judgment on Vickie\u0027s counterclaim, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so,\" the chief justice wrote. Meanwhile, Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The majority \"fails to follow the analysis that this Court more recently has held applicable to the evaluation of claims of a kind before us here, namely, claims that a congressional delegation of adjudicatory authority violates separation-of-powers principles derived from Article III,\" Breyer wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33948,"name":"Kent L.

The law, passed in 1998, gives an initial sum to candidates for state office who accept public financing and then provides additional matching funds based on the amounts spent by privately financed opponents and by independent groups. In 2008, some Republican candidates and a political action committee, the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, filed suit arguing that to avoid triggering matching funds for their opponents, they had to limit their spending and, in essence, their freedom of speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. District Court for District of Arizona found the matching-funds provision unconstitutional. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the case, saying it found \"minimal\" impact on freedom of speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment prohibit linking the funds participating candidates receive in an election to the amount of money raised by or spent on behalf of their opponents?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court order in a decision by Chief Justice John Roberts. \"Arizona\u0027s matching funds scheme substantially burdens political speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to survive First Amendment scrutiny,\" the chief justice writing for the majority, noted that the holding does not contend that the First Amendment forbids all public financing. Meanwhile, Justice Elena Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. \"The First Amendment\u0027s core purpose is to foster a healthy, vibrant political system full of robust discussion and debate,\" Kagan argued, adding: \"Nothing in Arizona\u0027s anti-corruption statute, the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act, violates this constitutional protection. To the contrary, the Act promotes the values underlying both the First Amendment and our entire Constitution by enhancing the \u0027opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45529,"name":"William R.

Guarnieri had challenged his firing through arbitration and was reinstated to his position as chief in 2005. His suit alleged that council then issued 11 employment directives, which he claimed placed humiliating restrictions on him, to retaliate against him. He further alleged the borough improperly withheld overtime pay from him and had improperly delayed issuing health insurance benefits. A jury heard the case in April 2008 and awarded Guarnieri $45,358 in compensatory damages and $52,000 in punitive damages. The borough appealed, arguing the evidence did not support the verdict. In February 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the overall verdict entered by a federal jury, but it overturned the panel\u0027s award of $52,000 in punitive damages. The ruling differs from decisions by all 10 other federal circuits and four state supreme courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay state and local government employees sue their employers for retaliation under the First Amendment\u0027s Petition Clause when they petition the government on matters of private concern?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Court vacated and remanded the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy. \"A government employer\u0027s allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employee\u0027s petition relates to a matter of public concern,\" Kennedy wrote. \"The Third Circuit\u0027s conclusion that the public concern test does not limit public employees\u0027 Petition Clause claims is incorrect.\" Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the judgment, writing: \"Even where a public employee petitions the government in its capacity as sovereign, I would balance the employee\u0027s right to petition the sovereign against the government\u0027s interest as an employer in the effective and efficient management of its internal affairs.\" Meanwhile, Justice Antonin Scalia dissented in part: \"I find the proposition that a lawsuit is a constitutionally protected \u0027Petition\u0027 quite doubtful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21319,"name":"Daniel R.

The plaintiffs brought the claim under the First and Fourteenth Amendments seeking to invalidate a newly-enacted law that imposed restrictions and labeling requirements on the sale or rental of \"violent video games\" to minors. The district court found in favor of the plaintiffs and prevented the enforcement of the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that: (1) violent video games did not constitute \"obscenity\" under the First Amendment, (2) the state did not not have a compelling interest in preventing psychological or neurological harm to minors allegedly caused by video games, and (3) even if the state had a compelling interest, the law was not narrowly tailored enough to meet that objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment bar a state from restricting the sale of violent video games to minors?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia. \"Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player\u0027s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.\" Justice Samuel Alito concurred in judgment, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts. Alito noted that he disagreed \"with the approach taken in the Court\u0027s opinion. In considering the application of unchanging constitutional principles to new and rapidly evolving technology, this Court should proceed with caution. We should make every effort to understand the new technology.\" Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer filed separate dissents. Adhering to his strict understanding of the Framers\u0027 intent with the Constitution, Thomas wrote: \"The Court\u0027s decision today does not comport with the original public understanding of the First Amendment.\" Breyer argued that the California statute met current constitutional standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":46705,"name":"Zackery P.

The court ordered the release of enough prisoners so the inmate population would come within 137.5 percent of the prisons\u0027 total design capacity.

Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, in which he admonished the majority for affirming \"what is perhaps the most radical injunction issued by a court in our Nation\u0027s history: an order requiring California to release the staggering number of 46,000 convicted criminals.\" Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, in which he wrote that the \"Constitution does not give federal judges the authority to run state penal systems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19760,"name":"Carter G.

After discovering his real name, the officers arrested him, handcuffed him and put him in the police car for giving false information to a police officer. Then they searched the vehicle and found a gun in his jacket. He was charged and convicted for possession of an illegal weapon. Following a jury trial, Davis was convicted and sentenced to 220 months in prison.

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito. \"Searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule,\" Alito wrote. Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined in the judgment only. Meanwhile, Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"The Court finds a new \u0027good faith\u0027 exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a Fourth Amendment violation, namely, suppression of the illegally seized evidence,\" Breyer notes, adding: \"At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.

This activity continued until S.E. was 15 and the victim was 12. S.E. and the victim were residents of the Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana. In 2005, the district court sentenced S.E. to two years of detention at a juvenile facility, followed by supervised release until his 21st birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2006, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\"). Its reporting and registration requirements apply to adults and juveniles 14 or older who commit certain serious sex offenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen S.E. completed his sentence, he moved to a prerelease center for six months. S.E. did not engage in a required job search and center officials deemed him a program failure, requesting his removal. In 2007, after SORNA\u0027s enactment, the district court revoked S.E.\u0027s supervised release because he failed to meet the conditions of supervision. The court ordered, among other conditions, that S.E. register as a sex offender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS.E. appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit, challenging the mandate to register as a sex offender. In May 2008, S.E. turned 21, and the order to register expired. Over a year later, Judge Stephen Reinhardt, writing for a unanimous court, held that SORNA was invalid on its face because the constitution forbids laws that are enforced retroactively. The Supreme Court, in a \u003cem\u003eper curiam\u003c/em\u003e opinion, asked the Montana Supreme Court to decide whether the question presented was moot because the district court\u0027s order had expired. Justice Jim Rice, writing for the court with two dissents, held that S.E. was obligated to register under the Montana Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (\"MSVORA\"). Hence, as Montana law required S.E. to register, and this registration was not contingent on the 9th Circuit\u0027s decision, the federal question was moot.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the state\u0027s requirement of sexual offender registration make S.E.\u0027s challenge to the federal requirement moot, ending his right to appeal?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a \u003cem\u003eper curiam\u003c/em\u003e decision, the court held that because S.E.\u0027s order of supervision had expired by the time of the 9th Circuit\u0027s decision, he needed to show that an appellate decision would redress some \"collateral consequence of the registration conditions\" or the question was moot. While a favorable decision might serve as useful precedent in a hypothetical lawsuit challenging Montana\u0027s requirement, the court held that this indirect benefit did not save this case from mootness. The court also rejected S.E.\u0027s argument that the question was not moot because the dispute was capable of repetition and likely to evade review; as S.E. was now 21, he would never again be subjected to the special conditions of juvenile supervision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Ruth B. Ginsburg, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit for that court\u0027s consideration of mootness in the first instance. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":21656,"name":"Donald B.

Horner had approached Fowler\u0027s accomplices as they sat in a stolen Oldsmobile, decked out in black clothes and gloves. Fowler, who had stepped out of the car to use cocaine, snuck up behind Horner, grabbed his gun, forced him to get on his knees and shot him in the back of the head. One of Fowler\u0027s accomplices later implicated him in the murder, and a jury convicted Fowler of killing Horner with the intent to prevent him from communicating information about a federal offense. He was sentenced to life in prison, plus 10 years. Fowler claimed the government failed to prove that a federal investigation would have been likely, and that Horner would have transferred the information to a federal officer or judge. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the lower court ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eTo prove a criminal violation of the federal witness tampering statute when a defendant allegedly kills a witness, must the government prove that the victim would have provided information regarding a crime to a court or a law enforcement officer?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the lower court order in a decision by Justice Stephen Breyer. \"The Government must show that there was a reasonable likelihood that a relevant communication would have been made to a federal officer,\" Breyer wrote. Justice Antonin Scalia filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he wrote that \"although I agree the case should be remanded for the Eleventh Circuit to consider whether the objection to sufficiency of the evidence was preserved or whether the District Court committed plain error, I would hold that there was insufficient evidence to support Fowler\u0027s conviction.\" Meanwhile, Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. The majority opinion \" veers off course when it goes on to hold that the prosecution was required to show that, if Officer Horner had not been killed, there was a \u0027reasonable likelihood\u0027 that his information would have reached a federal officer,\" Alito wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41104,"name":"Stephen M.

In part, he argued that he was denied access to the prison\u0027s chapel and religious services in violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"). The district court dismissed the claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Mr. Sossamon could not sue Texas officials in their individual capacities under the RLUIPA. The court reasoned that because the Act was passed pursuant to Congress\u0027 Spending Power and not its Fourteenth Amendment Power, it did not create a cause of action for damages against state officials sued in their individual capacities. As to official-capacity lawsuits, the Fifth Circuit held that regardless of whether RLUIPA creates such a cause of action, it is barred by Texas\u0027s sovereign immunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the RLUIPA, can a person sue a state official in his official capacity for damages?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas. \"States, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA,\" Thomas wrote for the 6-2 majority. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Stephen J. Breyer. \"Our precedents make clear that the phrase \u0027appropriate relief\u0027 includes monetary relief,\" she argued. \"By adopting a contrary reading of the term, the majority severely undermines the \u0027broad protection of religious exercise\u0027 Congress intended the statute to provide.\" Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33970,"name":"Kevin K.

They argued that payments made to doctors in their residency qualify for FICA\u0027s student exemption. The district court agreed and awarded judgment in favor of Mayo and the University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the residents in this case did not qualify for the FICA exemption. The court reasoned that Treasury Regulation 26 U.S.C. § 3121(b)(10) excludes \"full-time employees\" from the FICA student exemption. Here, the resident doctors were full-time employees and, therefore, were excluded from the FICA exemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the Treasury Department categorically exclude all medical residents who meet the FICA definition of student and who would be subject to the FICA student exemption?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. writing for a unanimous Court, upheld the Treasury Department\u0027s rule that treats medical residents as full-time employees, and therefore not exempt from the payment of payroll taxes is a valid interpretation of federal law.

After exhausting his state court remedies, he petitioned for habeas corpus relief in a California federal district court, arguing that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. The district court upheld Pinholster\u0027s conviction but granted habeas relief on his death sentence. A panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring rehearing en banc, the Ninth Circuit vacated the panel opinion and affirmed the District Court’s grant of habeas relief, holding that the denial of habeas relief during the guilt phase was appropriate, but not during the penalty phase. The court noted that \u003cem\u003eStrickland v. Washington\u003c/em\u003e requires trial counsel to investigate mitigating evidence at the penalty phase. Here, the court reasoned that Pinholster\u0027s counsel failed meet to meet his obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a federal court overturn a state criminal conviction on the basis of facts the defendant could have alleged, but did not, in state court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas. Limiting \"review to the state-court record is consistent with our precedents,\" Thomas wrote for the 5-4 majority. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a partial dissent in which he contended that \"I do not join Part III, for I would send this case back to the Court of Appeals so that it can apply the legal standards that Part II announces to the complex facts of this case.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, dissented in full. \"Some habeas petitioners are unable to develop the factual basis of their claims in state court through no fault of their own,\" Sotomayor argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":29247,"name":"James W.

Matthew Snyder filed a lawsuit against members of the Westboro Baptist Church who picketed at his funeral. The family accused the church and its founders of defamation, invasion of privacy and the intentional infliction of emotional distress for displaying signs that said, \"Thank God for dead soldiers\" and \"Fag troops\" at Snyder\u0027s funeral. U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett awarded the family $5 million in damages, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the judgment violated the First Amendment\u0027s protections on religious expression. The church members\u0027 speech is protected, \"notwithstanding the distasteful and repugnant nature of the words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the First Amendment protect protesters at a funeral from liability for intentionally inflicting emotional distress on the family of the deceased?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision in an opinion by Chief Justice John G.

Breyer filed a concurring opinion in which he wrote that while he agreed with the majority\u0027s conclusion in the case, \"I do not believe that our First Amendment analysis can stop at that point.\" Justice Samuel Alito filed a lone dissent, in which he argued: \"Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42125,"name":"Sean E.

They argued that JCG and JCM unlawfully made misleading statements in prospectuses about various Janus funds, most notably that it did not permit \"market timing\" of the funds – the practice of rapidly trading in and out of a mutual fund to take advantage of inefficiencies in the way the funds are valued. The district court dismissed the complaint holding that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that investors stated a claim against JCG and JCM by asserting that both were responsible for making misleading statements about the funds\u0027 prohibition of market timing. The court reasoned that JCG investors would have inferred that, even if JCM had not itself written the alleged misstatements about JCG\u0027s practice of market timing, JCM must have at least approved of the statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Fourth Circuit err in concluding that a service provider – in this case JCM – can be held liable in a private securities fraud action for \"helping or participating in\" another company\u0027s misstatements?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid the Fourth Circuit err in concluding that a service provider – in this case JCM – can be held liable in a private securities fraud action for statements that were not directly and contemporaneously attributable to the service provider?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court order in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas. \"Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b–5,\" Justice Thomas wrote. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. \"The majority has incorrectly interpreted the Rule\u0027s word \u0027make,\u0027\" Breyer argued. \"Both language and case law indicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a management company, a board of trustees, individual company officers, or others, separately or together, might \u0027make\u0027 statements contained in a firm\u0027s prospectus—even if a board of directors has ultimate content-related responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36483,"name":"Mark A.

On appeal, Mr. Bryant challenged the admission of the victim\u0027s statements at trial for violating his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The victim stated that Mr. Bryant shot him, but died shortly thereafter. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statements that the victim made to police before his death were testimonial and their admission violated Mr. Bryant\u0027s right to confrontation. The court reasoned that the victim\u0027s statements were made in the course of a police interrogation whose primary purpose was to establish or prove events that had already occurred, not to enable police to meet an ongoing emergency. Therefore, the lower court held that the statements were \"testimonial\" for the purposes of the enhanced confrontation protections set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in \u003cem\u003eCrawford v. Washington\u003c/em\u003e and should not have been admitted against Mr. Bryant at trial because he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the victim prior to his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre inquiries of wounded victims concerning the perpetrator non-testimonial if they objectively indicate that the purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency, and, thus, not afforded heightened protection under \u003cem\u003eCrawford v. Washington\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the lower court decision in a majority opinion by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The court held that the identification and description of the shooter and the location of the shooting were \"not testimonial statements because they had a \u0027primary purpose . . . to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u0027 Therefore, their admission at Bryant\u0027s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.\" Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a strongly-worded dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the majority opinion for distorting \"our confrontation clause jurisprudence and leav[ing] it in a shambles. Instead of clarifying the law, the court makes itself the obfuscator of last resort.\" The majority, he continued, \"creates an expansive exception to the confrontation clause for violent crimes.\" In a separate dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed with Scalia, but observed a \"well-established exception to the confrontation requirement: The cloak protecting the accused against admission of out-of-court testimonial statements was removed for dying declarations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34924,"name":"Lori B.
