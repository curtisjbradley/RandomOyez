In early May of 1957, Reino Hayhanen informed the American Embassy in Paris that he had been acting as a secret agent for the Soviet Union in the United States since 1952. He also informed the embassy that he had assisted a Soviet agent he only knew as “Mark”, whom he identified as a resident agent in the United States with the military rank of colonel. Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) agents began a long investigation of Abel, but did not seek to obtain a warrant of arrest or a search warrant relating to Abel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFBI agents gave three agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) a report on Abel as a suspected spy; the FBI agents also asked them to prepare an Immigration detention warrant. On June 21, 1957, FBI agents found Abel at the Latham Hotel in Manhattan and questioned him unsuccessfully for a half hour. A short time later, INS agents who were waiting outside packed up all of Abel’s personal effects in the room. They seized over two hundred items but found no weapons or evidence of alienage; the FBI also seized several items after an agent checked Abel out of the hotel, including three items contested at trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo INS agents flew Abel to a maximum security camp in McAllen, Texas, where FBI and INS agents interrogated him for four weeks. On the third day, he admitted he was in the United States illegally. A criminal warrant for Abel’s arrest was issued on August 7, 1957 while Abel was in his Texas cell; he also learned that same day that he was indicted for espionage. Agents brought Abel back to New York, where the district court tried and convicted him of espionage. The prosecution introduced seven items seized before the government obtained a search warrant. The United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, affirmed Abel’s conviction, holding that INS agents could search Abel’s hotel room incident to his valid arrest and pursuant to a deportation arrest warrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas Abel properly arrested pursuant to an administrative Immigration and Naturalization Service warrant despite an overlapping FBI investigation for espionage? Were the Fourth and Fifth Amendments violated when the United States searched and seized evidence from Abel while he was in custody pursuant to an INS warrant?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Felix Frankfurter, the Court held that the INS properly arrested Abel even though the FBI suspected him of espionage. Justice Frankfurter noted that the INS was simultaneously investigating Abel’s status in the United States and that it indeed commenced deportation proceedings against him. While acknowledging both that the INS delayed its arrest of Abel and that the FBI searched Abel’s room immediately after INS agents’ search, he did not consider this to be sufficient evidence of unreasonable “bad faith” cooperation between the INS and FBI. He argued that the government had two available ways of dealing with a criminally suspect deportable alien and simply chose to detain Abel for potential deportation first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Frankfurter also held that the items seized by both the INS and the FBI were properly introduced into evidence at trial. He could discern no constitutional reason to limit the search for materials proving the deportability of a validly arrested alien more than the Constitution limits the search for materials probative of a crime. Noting that INS agents had to apply to the District Director of the INS for a warrant, Justice Frankfurter argued that the differences in procedural protection between criminal and deportation arrests were not of constitutional significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas dissented, joined by Justice Hugo Black. He warned against allowing administrative officers such as INS agents to enter people’s homes without warrants, especially when the invasion is a front for a criminal investigation. Justice Douglas argued that the FBI were clearly the moving force behind Abel’s arrest and the search of his hotel room, noting that the FBI made no effort during the investigation to obtain a search warrant despite having plenty of time to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Brennan dissented, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Hugo Black, and Justice William Douglas. While acknowledging that Congress’ power over aliens may be great and that deportation may be described as a civil remedy, he rejected the majority’s notion that the fruits of a deportation warrant may be used in a criminal trial. He noted that there was no independent inquiry over the circumstances of the arrest and seizure, given that only a superior INS officer approved the deportation warrant. Justice Brennan argued that such an administrative search can never be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30019,"name":"James B.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, the U.S. government claimed priority over the lien on the “property rights to the property” of the general contractor.  The subcontractors also claimed priority, because the amounts owed to them were large enough that they constituted “trust funds” under a New York tax law.  The subcontractors were the beneficiaries of these “trust funds” so the general contractor had no property rights.  The New York Supreme Court, Special Term, granted the subcontractor’s motion to for summary judgment and the Appellate Division affirmed.

Dial of the United States Army and his wife, Joanna Dial, were charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of their one-year-old child while stationed in Germany. James Dial was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, sentenced to three years in prison, and dishonorably discharged. His wife was not an active member of the military, but because she was a dependent of an active military member, she was tried in military court in Germany. She moved to challenge the jurisdiction of the military court over her case, but the motion was denied. She pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to three years\u0027 imprisonment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Dial\u0027s mother, Alberta Singleton, filed a writ of habeas corpus on her daughter\u0027s behalf and argued that civilian dependents of military personnel cannot be tried in a military court. The circuit court judge stated he did not want to grant the writ of habeas corpus but was bound by the Supreme Court case \u003cem\u003eReid v. Covert\u003c/em\u003e, in which the Court held that non-military personnel cannot be court martialed for capital offenses. Nina Kinsella, the warden where Mrs. Dial was serving her time, appealed the writ and argued that the defendant in \u003cem\u003eReid v. Covert\u003c/em\u003e was on trial for a capital offense, whereas Mrs. Dial was on a trial for a non-capital offense. Therefore, the court was not bound by that case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo military courts have jurisdiction over civilian dependents of military personnel?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Tom C. Clark delivered the opinion for the 7-2 majority. The Court held that civilian dependents of active service members can only be court martialed for capital offenses. The Constitution does not allow for the extension of military power to have jurisdiction over civilians. Therefore, James Dial’s wife had a right to trial in a court protecting her rights as outlined under Article III of the Constitution and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Charles E. Whittaker wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which he argued that non-military personnel employed by the military overseas may be under military jurisdiction during peace times. However, Joanna Dial was a dependent of an active military member, and she was not employed by the military, so she should not have been court martialed. Justice Potter Stewart joined the opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the interpretation of military “status” should not automatically exclude non-military personnel. One’s status as non-military personnel should only be a factor while determining jurisdiction, and the relationship of non-military personnel with the military establishment should also be examined. The Constitution allows the Court to consider these factors in determining appropriate jurisdiction. Justice Felix Frankfurter joined the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":27130,"name":"Harold H.

Her husband, Marvin Paul Goett, drowned while repairing a barge owned by Union Carbide Corp.  Marvin worked for Amherst Barge Corp. as a sand blaster.  Ellen argued that Union Carbide was negligent when it delivered the barge to Amherst for repairs without any rescue equipment.  The district court ruled in favor of the Goetts, finding that the barge was unseaworthy and Union Carbide was negligent.  The court awarded the maximum amount of damages based on negligence.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Union Carbide did not owe a duty of seaworthiness to Amherst employees.  The court also held that the barge was not unseaworthy but did not indicate whether the Goetts could recover damages if it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Was the barge unseaworthy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Does maritime law allow recovery for wrongful death independently of the West Virginia Wrongful Death Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo answer.  In a per curiam opinion, the court vacated the lower judgment and remanded to determine whether the West Virginia Wrongful Death Act uses the state law or maritime law concept of negligence.  On remand, the court of appeals should also consider whether the Act incorporates the doctrine of unseaworthiness.  Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Hugo L. Black, Justice William O. Douglas, and Justice William J. Brennan wrote in a footnote that they voted with the majority only because of the Court’s recent ruling on this issue in \u003ci\u003eThe Tungus v Skovgaard\u003c/i\u003e, although he disagreed with that ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M.

Brennan wrote for a four-judge plurality reversing the lower judgment.  The Supreme Court held that the lower court did not need to decide the constitutionality of the union shop agreement.   The Court remanded the case with suggestions for possible remedies.  Justice William O. Douglas wrote a concurrence noting reservations about the suggested remedies.  Justice Charles E. Whitaker concurred in part, but dissented to the suggestion of remedies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L.

On the bed of the river was a concrete structure called a baffle deck, which extended the width of the dam. This deck was lined with concrete blocks called ‘baffles’, designed to reduce the downstream velocity of the river. Over the years, the flow of water eroded the baffles. To restore them to their original condition, the United States contracted with Larson Construction Company, an independent contractor. The United States retained the right to inspect Larson’s work, but did not have direct control over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn August 20, 1954, Larson’s tug ‘Muleduzer’ set out from Bradford Island pushing Larson’s barge. As the tug and barge approached bay nine, the Columbia River’s flow was clearly turbulent; despite this, Larson proceeded with its work. The barge veered north when it reached bay nine and the port bow struck a pier. Water flooded a hole in the bow, and the barge and tug were swamped and sunk. Most of the crew drowned, including George William Graham; Graham was a member of the sounding party aboard the tug. The crew died in navigable Oregon waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Oregon’s Employers’ Liability Law (ELL), employers were liable for failure to use every device, care and precaution practicable for the protection and safety of life and limb. Oregon’s Wrongful Death Act (WDA), however, only permitted recovery for deaths caused by a wrongful act or omission, and set contributory negligence as an absolute bar to recovery. Henry Hess, the administrator of Graham’s estate, filed an action against the United States under both the ELL and the WDA. The district court entered judgment for the United States, holding that the United States was not liable under either statute. It ruled that the ELL did not apply to Hess’ case in part because the ELL imposed a higher standard of duty than federal maritime law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that only the WDA applied to Hess’ claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCould Hess invoke Oregon\u0027s Employers’ Liability Law to recover for Graham’s maritime death, even though the ELL imposed a higher standard of duty than federal maritime law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 6-3 opinion written by Justice Potter Stewart, the Court held that there was no constitutional impediment to applying Oregon’s Employers’ Liability Law to Hess’ claim through maritime law. Justice Stewart cited precedent that wrongful deaths in state territorial waters were not judged under maritime law’s standards of duty, but rather under the substantive standards of state law. He argued that it would be an anomaly to allow states to create a right of action for death, but not to allow them to determine the circumstances under which that right exists. Justice Stewart refused to answer whether a state wrongful death act might offend traditional principles of maritime law, noting that the ELL was in some ways more in consonance with general maritime law principles than the WDA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Hugo Black, Justice William Douglas and Justice William Brennan concurred. They argued for the evenhanded application of the Court’s recent ruling in \u003ci\u003eTungus v. Skovgaard\u003c/i\u003e, but took issue with that case’s holding that the federal maritime wrongful death duty depended on the substantive law of a given state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan dissented, joined by Justice Felix Frankfurter. Justice Harlan noted that Oregon imposed a higher standard of duty for wrongful deaths on its navigable waters, but that the normal lesser maritime duty applied to injuries short of death. He argued that the Court should not impose a state standard of duty higher than the general maritime duty unless that state explicitly required it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Charles Whittaker also dissented, joining Justice Harlan’s dissent except for its implication that wrongful deaths on the navigable waters of a state are ever governed by the general substantive tort laws of that state.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":18591,"name":"Cleveland C.

In 1956, he was deported for having been a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s. When he was deported, his old-age benefits were terminated and notice was given to his wife, who remained in the country and was eligible to receive his benefits. Nestor sued in district court and argued that the termination of his benefits violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in that it deprived him of an accrued property right. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Nestor, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare directly appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the termination of Social Security benefits when the recipient is deported violate the Fifth Amendment right to accrued property?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice John M. Harlan delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Supreme Court held that the Social Security system was meant to be a form of long-term social insurance that has to constantly adapt to the demands of a changing workforce, which prevents it from fitting within the framework of the right to accrued property. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment only bars government action that is arbitrary or lacking in rational justification, neither of which is true in this case. The Court also held that the termination of benefits was not punitive but rather the “denial of a non-contractual government benefit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Hugo L. Black wrote a dissenting opinion and argued that, because Nestor had been paying into the Social Security fund before he began receiving benefits, the government’s termination of his benefits was effectively depriving him of his property without just compensation. He also argued that both the deportation and termination of Nestor’s benefits, based solely on the fact that he was a member of the Communist Party 20 years previously when it was not illegal to do so, imposes an ex post facto law on him. In his separate dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas argued that receiving Social Security benefits is a right earned by years of working and paying into the system, which Nestor did. The deprivation of those rights is a punishment that should only be reserved for those convicted of a crime. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., also wrote a separate dissenting opinion in which he argued that the deprivation of Social Security benefits for certain offenses constituted a punishment without judicial trial in violation of the prohibition against ex post facto laws. Chief Justice Earl Warren, and Justice William O. Douglas joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35692,"name":"Mr John F.

Their manufacturing processes produced industrial waste.  Water containing waste was recycled back into the river.  Most of the solid waste was separated and disposed of, but liquid and small particles were dumped into the river.  Over time, these small particles reduced the river depth from 21 feet to less than 9 feet in some places.  The Rivers and Waters Act prohibits the “creation of any obstruction….to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States.”  The statue does allow for certain exceptions authorized by the Secretary of the Army.  The United States sued the steel companies for creating an obstruction by dumping their industrial waste.  The district court granted an injunction.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the waste deposits did not constitute an “obstruction” under the Act and even if it did, an injunction was not permitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is the discharge of industrial waste from steel mills into a navigable waterway a violation of the Rivers and Waters Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) If so, is the U.S. entitled to an order compelling removal of the waste and enjoining further waste disposal?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, yes.  Justice William O. Douglas, writing for a 5-4 majority, reversed and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that the deposits were an obstruction within the meaning of the act and were not exempt.  The Court also held that the district court was authorized to issue an injunction against the steel companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan dissented, arguing that the majority incorrectly interpreted the Rivers and Waters Act.  He argued that “obstruction” only referred to certain kinds of obstruction, not including industrial waste.  Justice Felix Frankfurter, Justice Charles E. Whittaker, and Justice Potter Stewart joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32701,"name":"J.

Sentilles, an engineer specializing in marine refrigeration, left the port of Santa Mara, Colombia, aboard the S.S. Montego to assist the ship in transporting bananas to Miami, Florida. The ship experienced rough waters during the journey, and on one occasion, Sentilles was knocked off his feet and washed across the deck by a large wave. The next day he developed a cough and other flu-like symptoms that persisted for several days. From Miami, he traveled to New Orleans, where he was treated for an acute case of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sentilles sued the owner of the S.S. Montego, the Inter-Shipping Corporation (“Shipping”), in federal district court under the Jones Act, which regulates U.S. shipowners. Sentilles argued that the accident aboard the S.S. Montego activated or aggravated a dormant tuberculosis infection. At trial, three medical specialists suggested that the accident could have caused the tuberculosis flare-up. A jury found in favor of Sentilles and awarded him $20,000 in damages. On appeal, Shipping argued that the evidence did not justify the jury’s conclusion. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals accepted Shipping’s argument and reversed the judgment. Sentilles argued that the appellate court applied an improper standard of review by failing to consider the reasonableness of the judgment reached by the jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the appellate court limit its review to the reasonableness of an inference or conclusion drawn by a jury?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 8-0 majority. The Court held that the testimony of the medical specialists supported the reasonableness of the judgment in favor of Sentilles. The Court noted that the role of the appellate court is not to independently review the evidence, but rather is limited to considering the reasonableness of decisions reached in the lower tribunal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan concurred in the Court’s opinion. Justice Charles E. Whittaker wrote a concurring opinion in which he noted that the record contained evidence that the accident actually caused the tuberculosis. In an opinion concurring in the judgment, Justice Potter Stewart disagreed with the Court’s standard of review and instead reversed the appellate court upon an independent examination of the record. He also argued that the Court should not grant certiorari to cases in which the sufficiency of the evidence is the sole question before the Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter wrote a dissent in which he agreed with Justice Stewart’s conclusion that the Court should not hear these types of cases. Rather than deciding the case, Justice Frankfurter argued that the Court should have dismissed its writ of certiorari after the parties’ oral arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36150,"name":"Milton Kelner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/milton_kelner","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kelner","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"milton_kelner"},"advocate_description":"for the Petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21596"},{"advocate":{"ID":38817,"name":"Robert J.
