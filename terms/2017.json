Alejandro Rodriguez and other detained noncitizens sued and argued that their prolonged detention without hearings and determinations to justify the detentions violated their due process rights. After litigation regarding class certification, the district court granted a preliminary injunction that required the government to provide each detainee with a bond hearing and to release that detainee unless the government could show, by clear and convincing evidence, that continued detention was justified. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that prolonged detention without a hearing raised serious constitutional concerns, and therefore that the relevant mandatory statutory language should be interpreted as having a time limitation; at the six-month mark, detainees are entitled to bond hearings. Because the plaintiff class proved that it was likely to succeed on the merits, the appellate court affirmed the grant of the preliminary injunction. The plaintiff class then moved for a permanent injunction, which the district court granted and the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court also determined that the duration of future detention and likelihood of eventual removal should not be considered in the bond hearings, and the noncitizens are entitled to bond hearings at six-month intervals throughout their detentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre noncitizens who are subject to mandatory detention under the relevant text of the Immigration and Nationality Act entitled to bond hearings, with the possibility of release, if their detentions last six months?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAre the noncitizens entitled to release unless the government proves by clear and convincing evidence that the noncitizens are dangers to their communities and flight risks?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eShould the length of the noncitizen’s detention be weighed in favor of release, and should new bond hearings be provided automatically every six months?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c) do not give detained aliens the right to periodic bond hearings during the course of their detention, and the Ninth Circuit misapplied the canon of constitutional avoidance in holding otherwise. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part II (for which there was a plurality). Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy joined Justice Alito’s opinion in full, and Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined as to all but Part II (regarding jurisdiction of the Court to hear the case).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Part II-A, a plurality of the Court (Alito, Roberts, Kennedy) held that it had jurisdiction to consider the respondents\u0027 claims, despite potential obstacles from 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1226(e). Section 1252(b)(9) limits the availablility of judicial review in removal proceedings to final orders only. The plurality noted that the \"respondents are not asking for review of an order of removal; they are not challenging the decision to detain them in the first place or to seek removal; and they are not even challenging any part of the process by which their removability will be determined.\" Thus, that section does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Part II-B, the plurality similarly found that Section 1226(e), which states that the attorney general\u0027s discretionary judgment in removal matters \"shall not be subject to review.\" It found that a challenge to the extent of the government\u0027s detention authority is outside the scope of this provision and thus that exercise of jurisdiction is proper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting for the majority (Alito, Roberts, Kennedy, Gorsuch, Thomas) in Part III, Justice Alito considered the merits of the arguments. In III-A, he looked directly to the statutory text of Sections 1225(b) and found nothing in the text from which to infer a six-month time limit on the length of detention. Without textual support, the canon of constitutional avoidance is inapplicable, and the Ninth Circuit was incorrect to rely on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000/99-7791\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eZadvydas v. Davis\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e as authority for inferring a time limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Part II-B, the majority interpreted Section 1226(c), which allows aliens to be released \"only if\" the attorney general decides that certain conditions are met, as unequivocally prohibiting their release under any other conditions. Because release on bail is prohibited, a bail hearing (periodic or otherwise) is unnecessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Part II-C, the majority and Justice Sonia Sotomayor found that Section 1226(a) authorizes the attorney general to arrest and detain an alien \"pending a decision\" on removal and permits the attorney general to release the alien on bond. Nothing in the text of this provision supports the imposition of periodic bond hearings or the consideration of the length of detention to determine whether an alien should be released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Gorsuch joined except for footnote 6. Justice Thomas opined that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) because claims challenging detention during removal proceedings fall squarely within the jurisdictional bar in that provision. Justice Thomas also wrote to say that the application of Section 1252(b)(9) does not violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor joined. The dissent highlights the fact that the case concerns \"persons whom immigration authorities believe are not citizens and may not have a right to enter into, or remain within, the United States\" but who \"[n]onetheless ... likely have a reasonable claim that they do have such a right.\" The dissent looks to constitutional language, purposes, and tradition, to find that bail is most likely required in these instances of civil confinement, and that at the very least a bail hearing is required. Finally, the dissent finds that interpreting the statute to require bail proceedings in instances of prolonged detention does not run contrary to the plain language or purpose of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Kagan took no part in the decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36722,"name":"Malcolm L.

In 2007 and 2009, Dimaya was convicted under the California Penal Code for first-degree residential burglary; both convictions resulted in two years’ imprisonment. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a non-citizen convicted of an aggravated felony is subject to deportation. The INA definition of aggravated felony includes a “crime of violence,” which is any offense that involves the use or substantial risk of physical force against another person or property.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently initiated deportation proceedings against Dimaya and claimed that his burglary convictions constituted crimes of violence under the Act. The Immigration Judge held that Dimaya was deportable and that burglary constitutes a crime of violence because it always involves a risk of physical violence. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Dimaya’s appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Johnson v. United States, which held  that the definition of a “violent felony” in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) was unconstitutionally vague. As a result, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the INA’s crime of violence provision was unconstitutionally vague because it was largely similar to the violent felony provision in the ACCA that the Supreme Court struck down in Johnson. The appellate court found that both provisions denied fair notice to defendants and failed to make clear when a risk of violence could be considered substantial.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the Immigration and Nationality Act’s “crime of violence” provision unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Immigration and Nationality Act’s “crime of violence” provision is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the 5-4 opinion as to parts . To determine whether a person’s conduct falls within a \"crime of violence\" under Section 16(b), courts consider the overall nature of the offense, particularly “whether ‘the ordinary case’ of an offense poses the requisite risk.” The Court found that the term “ordinary case” under the “crime of violence” was too vague in that it risked unpredictable and arbitrary interpretation. In 2015, the Court struck down as unconstitutionally vague a similar provision of a different statute, see \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/13-7120\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJohnson v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, 576 U.S. ___ (2015)\u003c/a\u003e, and this provision suffers from the same problems as the one in that case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plurality of the court (the majority minus Justice Neil Gorsuch) rejected the government’s argument removal cases deserved a less rigid form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine, largely because the penalty of deportation is so severe. Justice Gorsuch wrote a separate opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which he opined that even civil statutes that do not involve removal should be subject to a stringent void-for-vagueness review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito, dissented. Chief Justice Roberts argued that unlike the provision of a criminal statute that the Court struck down as overly vague in \u003cem\u003eJohnson\u003c/em\u003e, the provision of the INA does not present the same kind of uncertainty that was present in that case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, joined in part by Justices Kennedy and Alito, to express \"doubt that our practice of striking down statutes as unconstitutionally vague is consistent with the original meaning of the Due Process Clause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22617,"name":"Edwin S.

Numerous states and other organizations challenged the validity of the agencies’ rule and contended both that it did not conform with the CWA and was improperly adopted in violation of the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. Following consolidation of the claims before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the National Association of Manufacturers intervened to join the plaintiffs and moved to dismiss. The plaintiffs argued that the CWA does not provide the federal circuit courts with jurisdiction over the agencies’ rule and that review is properly held in the district courts instead. The appellate court held that it had jurisdiction because, although the rule only defined the scope of U.S. waters, by defining its boundaries, the rule functionally placed restrictions on activity related to the waters. Therefore, the rule affected permitting requirements and thus had the practical effect of granting or denying permits. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Clean Water Act grant federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review the Environmental Protection Agency’s rule that defines the scope of United States waters?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed and remanded, holding because that the Waters of the United States Rule (WOTUS Rule or Rule) does not fall within the scope of Section 1369(b)(1) of the CWA, challenges to the rule must be filed in federal district courts rather than appellate courts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting for a unanimous Court, Justice Sotomayor explained that there are generally two avenues for challenging final EPA actions: (1) in federal district court under the Administrative Procedures Act, or (2) in federal appellate court if the challenged action falls under one of seven specifically enumerated categories. Here, the Court rejected the government\u0027s arguments that the WOTUS Rule falls under two of the categories of EPA actions that are exclusively reviewable at the appellate level in the first instance. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that the first category, under §1369(b)(1)(E), which pertains to agency actions “approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, 1312, 1316, or 1345” does not apply because the WOTUS Rule is not an effluent limitation. It is also not an \"other limitation,\" which the statutory structure suggested must be similar to an effluent limitation. Further, the Rule was not promulgated under § 1311 because that section does not provide authority to define statutory terms appearing elsewhere in the CWA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second category, which pertains to actions falling under § 1369(b)(1)(F), encompasses and grants exclusive and original jurisdiction to courts of appeal to review EPA actions “issuing or denying any permit under section 1342.” The WOTUS Rule does not issue or deny individual permit applications, and the Court therefore rejected the argument that the Rule was exclusively reviewable in appellate court under § 1369(b)(1)(F).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the Court rejected a number of policy arguments the government offered in support of its position. Though acknowledging the persuasiveness of arguments in favor of judicial efficiency and national uniformity with regard to broad regulations, among others, the Court held that these contentions did not outweigh the importance of following the statutory text.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42423,"name":"Timothy S.

Epic has an arbitration agreement that requires its employees to resolve any employment-based disputes with Epic through individual arbitration and to waive their right to participate in or receive benefit from any class, collective, or representative proceedings. In February 2015, former Epic employee Jacob Lewis sued Epic in federal court individually and on behalf of similarly-situated employees and claimed that they had been denied overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Epic moved to dismiss the complaint and cited the waiver clause of its arbitration agreement. The district court denied Epic’s motion and held that the waiver was unenforceable because it violated the right of employees to engage in “concerted activities” under Section Seven of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision and added that the waiver was also unenforceable under the savings clause of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That clause provides that arbitration agreements are to be enforced unless there legal or equitable grounds that would render a contract unenforceable. Finding the waiver of collective proceedings illegal under the NLRA, the appellate court held that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable under the FAA. This case was consolidated with Ernst \u0026amp; Young v. Morris  and National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., both cases that dealt with the relationship between the FAA and the NLRA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the National Labor Relations Act prohibit enforcement of an agreement requiring employees to resolve disputes with the employer through individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that neither the Arbitration Act\u0027s saving clause nor the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) supersede Congress\u0027s instructions in the Federal Arbitration Act that arbitration agreements providing for individualized proceedings must be enforced. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion for a 5-4 majority. The majority found that the Federal Arbitration Act \"instructed federal courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms\" and that the NLRA \"does not mention class or collection action procedures\" and thus cannot be read to displace the Arbitration Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion to add that \"the employees also cannot prevail under the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. The dissent noted the extreme imbalance between employer and employee and Congress\u0027s attempt to remedy that imbalance in passing the NLRA and its forerunner, the Norris-LaGuardia Act. In this context, the dissent found that the Federal Arbitration Act should not shrink the NLRA\u0027s \"protective sphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

Upon arrival, the officers heard loud music coming from the house. The officers then entered the house and observed party guests, including Theodore Wesby, drinking and watching “scantily clad women with money tucked into garter belts.” The partygoers claimed that a woman called “Peaches” was the host of the party, and that she had received permission from the owner, from whom Peaches was leasing the house. One partygoer called Peaches on the phone for an officer, since Peaches was not present. Peaches confirmed that she had permission from the owner, but when an officer called the owner, the owner claimed that the lease had not been executed and that he had not given permission for the party. The officers subsequently arrested the partygoers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixteen of the arrested partygoers sued the officers and the District of Columbia for false arrest. The district court ruled in favor of the partygoers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed and held both that the officers did not have probable cause for entry and were not entitled to immunity from liability. Probable cause to arrest for unlawful entry under D.C. law exists where a reasonable officer concludes from information known at the time that the arrestee knew or should have known that they entered the house against the will of the owner. The court reasoned that, because the partygoers believed in good faith that the owner had given Peaches permission for the party, they could not have intended to enter unlawfully. The court also ruled that the officers were not entitled to immunity because it was unreasonable for them to believe that they were not violating the partygoers’ clearly established Fourth Amendment rights against false arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo officers have probable cause to arrest for unlawful entry under D.C. law despite a claim of good-faith entry?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWas the law sufficiently clearly established to justify the denial of immunity to the officers?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed and remanded. Justice Thomas authored the majority opinion, which held that (1) the officers had probable cause to arrest the partygoers, and (2) the officers were entitled to qualified immunity under 42 U. S. C. §1983. With regard to probable cause, Justice Thomas explained that the D.C. Circuit erred in analyzing individual factors rather than the totality of the circumstances at the party scene, which could have reasonably led the officers to believe that there was a substantial chance of criminal activity. On the qualified immunity question, the majority held that the officers were protected from suit unless their actions were \"clearly\" unlawful at the time. Given that they could have reasonably but mistakenly thought that they had probable cause to make the arrests at the time, their actions were not clearly unlawful. Justice Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Ginsburg filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62854,"name":"Todd S.

Class, representing himself, pleaded guilty in the district court. He appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on grounds of constitutional error and statutory error. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the district court and found Class guilty due to his guilty plea. The appellate court explained that the its precedent in \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Delgado-Garcia\u003c/em\u003e—which held that, “[u]nconditional guilty pleas that are knowing and intelligent...waive the pleading defendant[‘s] claims of error on appeal, even constitutional claims”—is binding on this case. Delgado articulates two exceptions to this rule in which a defendant may appeal: (1) “the defendant’s claimed right to not be haled into court at all” and (2) “that the court below lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case…” However, the court held that neither exception applies here.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a guilty plea inherently waive a defendant’s right to challenge the constitutionality of his conviction?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, a guilty plea alone does not bar a federal criminal defendant from challenging the constitutionality of his conviction. Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court. The Court looked at several prior decisions developing its jurisprudence on how a guilty plea affects the constitutional claims available to a criminal defendant, finding a clear doctrine that \"a plea of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim that—judged on its face—the charge is one which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.\" The Court found that Class had neither expressly nor implicitly waived his constitutional claims by pleading guilty and that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), which governs \"conditional\" guilty pleas, is inapplicable because the Rule\u0027s drafters specifically stated that the rule \"has no application\" to the types of constitutional claims raised in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined, criticizing the majority for reaching a decision not clearly grounded in the Constitution or other basis, and for failing to clarify the \"confusing\" doctrine established in prior cases. The dissent looked first to the Constitution and found that it does not prohibit the waiver of rights Class asserted, then found that neither is there a federal statute or rule that bars such waiver. Ultimately, the dissent found that Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should govern the case and thus that an unconditional guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional claims, except for those specifically described in the prior Court cases on point.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22289,"name":"Eric J.

She alleges that she and her supervisor developed a contentious relationship and that he singled her out for unfair treatment in the workplace. On April 17, 2009, Artis took her first administrative step against DOH by filing a discrimination claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and while that claim was pending, DOH terminated Artis’s employment in November 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December 2011, Artis filed a lawsuit against the District in federal court alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and invoked the district court’s supplemental jurisdiction to assert claims based on the District’s Whistleblower Act, False Claims Act, and common law. The district court granted the District’s motion on the pleadings and dismissed Artis’s sole federal claim, violation of Title VII, as facially deficient. It thus found it had no basis to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty-nine days after her claims were dismissed in federal court, Artis filed the remaining claims in a D.C. trial court. The District alleged that Artis’s claims were time barred based on the respective statutes of limitations, and the trial judge agreed, finding that the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) does not suspend state statutes of limitations at the time of the unsuccessful federal filing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the tolling provision in 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) suspend the limitations period for the state-law claims while the claim is pending and for 30 days after the claim is dismissed, or does it merely provide 30 days beyond the dismissal for the plaintiff to refile?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed and remanded, ruling in favor of Artis and finding that the tolling provision of 28 U.S.C. § 1367 operates to suspend or “stop-the-clock” on supplemental state court claims while the concordant federal suit is pending and for 30 days thereafter. The majority rejected the District of Columbia’s argument that the statute simply provides for a 30-day grace period to refile those claims in state court. The Court also rejected the argument that it should disavow the stop-the-clock approach as a matter of constitutional avoidance, explaining that questions regarding the constitutionality of §1367(d) had been settled under prior case law. Justice Gorsuch dissented, with Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy joining.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62644,"name":"Adam G.

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Fannie Mae and NHS on September 14, 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) and 28 U.S.C. Section 2107(a), Hamer had until October 14, 2015 to appeal the judgment. On October 8, 2015, her attorney filed a motion to extend the appeal deadline to December 14, 2015, which the district court granted. Hamer filed her appeal on December 11, 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a brief requested by the appellate court, Fannie Mae and NHS argued that Hamer’s appeal was untimely under Rule 4(a)(5)(C) and thus that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. That rule states that “[n]o extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.” Hamer argued that the rule is at odds with 28 U.S.C. Section 2107(a), which provides that “the district court may, upon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.” The appellate court found Hamer’s argument unpersuasive and dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)(C) deprive a court of appeals of jurisdiction over an appeal that is statutorily timely?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA court-made rule imposing a time limit is not jurisdictional. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion for a unanimous court. In Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205 (2007), the Court held an appeal filing deadline prescribed by statute is \"jurisdictional\" in that missing the deadline requires dismissal of the appeal. Here, applying the principle that only Congress may determine a lower federal court\u0027s subject matter jurisdiction, the Court noted that in contrast to congressional legislation, court-made rules (including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure) cannot be jurisdictional. The Court vacated the decision of the of the Seventh Circuit and remanded for further proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62855,"name":"Jonathan A.

At sentencing, Wilson’s attorney argued that Wilson was not the triggerman and presented evidence of his difficult childhood. The trial court sentenced Wilson to death, and the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed his convictions and sentence on direct appeal. Wilson filed a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia, in which he argued ineffective assistance of his trial counsel in the sentencing phase of his trial. His argument rested on lay testimony that could have been used as evidence of his difficult childhood and expert testimony that could have explained his poor judgment skills. The superior court denied the petition in a written order. Wilson then filed an application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal, which the Georgia Supreme Court summarily denied in a one-sentence order. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilson then filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the district court denied him relief on the grounds that the state trial court reasonably applied clearly established federal law. However, the district court granted Wilson a certificate of appealability on the issue of effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. A panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision, reasoning that “the one-line decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia . . . is the relevant state-court decision for our review because it is the final decision on the merits.” In his petition for rehearing en banc, Wilson argued that the panel should have examined the last reasoned decision by a state court. Georgia originally argued a federal court should “look through” a summary order to see whether it was based on procedural grounds or merits, but then it changed its position and argued that the court should look to the reasoned opinion. The Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, appointed an amicus curiae to argue Georgia’s original position on the matter. The Eleventh Circuit en banc ultimately concluded that federal courts do not need to “look through” a summary decision on the merits to review the reasoning of a lower court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the appeals court err in holding that Harrington v. Richter silently abrogates the presumption that a federal court sitting in habeas proceedings should “look through” a summary state court ruling to review the last reasoned decision?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling, holding that a federal habeas court reviewing an unexplained state court decision on the merits should “look through” that decision to the most recent related state court decision that provides a relevant rationale and presume that the unexplained decision adopted the same reasoning, and that the state may rebut that presumption by showing that the unexplained decision most likely relied on different grounds than the reasoned decision below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that since its holding in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990/90-68\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eYlst v. Nunnemaker\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, every circuit to have considered the matter except for the Eleventh Circuit has applied a “look through” presumption where there has been a reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim and subsequent unexplained orders upholding the judgment or rejecting the same claim, presuming that those later unexplained orders rested on the same ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court rejected the state’s argument that its opinion in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010/09-587\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHarrington v. Richter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e controls in this context, as that case did not directly consider the “look through” issue, and it also did not bar the application of \u003cem\u003eYlst\u003c/em\u003e’s reasoning in a case involving an unexplained decision on the merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court further explained that the “look through” presumption is not an absolute rule, and that while it is not a presumption that the Court applies in a general sense relative to silent opinions, when federal courts employ it pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, it is for a specific and narrow purpose. Thus, there should be no reason why a federal court’s opinion of a state court’s silence should create binding precedent outside of this context. Finally, the Court explained that the “look through” approach does not show disrespect for the states, and is unlikely to lead a large number of courts to write full opinions where they otherwise would have ruled summarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court remanded the case to the Eleventh Circuit for further review consistent with the majority opinion. Justice Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Alito and Thomas joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36425,"name":"Mark E.

At that time, MBP Equity Partners 1, LLC (MBP), a member of Lakeridge, decided to sell its claim on Lakeridge’s assets to Robert Rabkin. In a deposition, Rabkin testified that he had a close relationship with a member of MBP’s board. U.S. Bank National Association, which also held a claim to Lakeridge’s assets, offered to purchase Rabkin’s claim, but Rabkin decided not to accept it. U.S. Bank subsequently filed a motion to designate Rabkin as both a statutory and non-statutory insider, either of which would prevent Rabkin from voting on bankruptcy plan proceedings. The bankruptcy court held that Rabkin had become a statutory insider by purchasing a claim from MBP, which the court considered an insider because it was an affiliate of Lakeridge. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that insider status is a question of fact that appellate courts review under the deferential standard of clear error. Under the clear error standard, an appellate court will only reverse a lower court’s finding if it is clear from the evidence that a mistake has been made. After reviewing the case under this standard, the appellate court reversed and held that a third party that is assigned a claim does not assume the insider status of the assigning party. The court also held that Rabkin was not a non-statutory insider because the evidence did not show that Rabkin had a close enough relationship with the member of MBP’s board to be considered an insider.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a designation of non-statutory insider status reviewable under the standard of clear error?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit was correct to review the Bankruptcy Court\u0027s determination under a \"clear error\" standard because the \"mixed question\" whether a designation of non-statutory insider status is more factual than legal. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. In the Ninth Circuit, the determination of insider status turns on whether the facts support an \"arm\u0027s length transaction\" between the parties. Applied to the facts of this case, the issue was whether Rabkin’s purchase of MBP’s claim was conducted as if the two were strangers to each other? While this question involves issues of law and fact, the answer turns primarily on factual determinations, therefore the more deferential \"clear error\" standard was the appropriate standard of review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Anthony Kennedy filed concurring opinion to clarify that the Court does not necessarily find that the Ninth Circuit\u0027s standard is complete or proper, only that the application of that standard leads to the result the Court did in fact reach. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also filed a concurring opinion, in which Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Gorsuch joined,  disapproving the Court\u0027s decision not to address the question whether the Ninth Circuit\u0027s \"arm\u0027s length transaction\" standard is the correct one.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62886,"name":"Gregory A.

(Leidos) provides defense, intelligence, homeland security, and other services to government agencies. In 2000, Leidos developed and implemented an automated timekeeping program (CityTime) in New York City. Leidos hired Gerard Denault as CityTime’s manager, and he enlisted a company called Technodyne to provide staffing for the CityTime project. Denault engaged in a scheme to hire more Technodyne workers than necessary to “inflate billable hours and hourly rates” and amended the contract between CityTime and Technodyne to transfer any risk of “cost overruns” to New York City. The result was that New York City was billed $635 million, instead of the $63 million the city had budgeted for the contract. Leidos removed Denault from his position and hired an outside firm to conduct an investigation, which uncovered Denault’s improper timekeeping. He was criminally prosecuted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Indiana Public Retirement Systems (Investors) sued Leidos in federal district court under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, which makes an omission fraudulent only if the omitted information is necessary to make an affirmative statement not misleading. The Investors claimed that Leidos failed to disclose potential liability stemming from the CityTime fraud and that omission was fraudulent. The district court dismissed the Investors’ claim and denied their motion for relief from judgment. The Investors sought to amend their complaint, but the district court denied the proposed second amended complaint, reasoning that amendment would be “futile.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the district court improperly denied the Investors’ motion to amend their complaint. The appellate court held that a company can be liable for merely omitting information, even if disclosure of that information is not necessary to make affirmative statements not misleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn October 17, 2017, the Court removed this case from the argument calendar and noted the case as held in abeyance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs there an affirmative duty to disclose information under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eOn October 17, 2017, the Court removed this case from the argument calendar and noted the case as held in abeyance.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20869,"name":"David C.

The surviving aliens and the families of those who perished in the attacks accused Arab Bank, PLC (Arab Bank), a bank corporation headquartered in Jordan, of financing and facilitating various terrorist organizations involved in the attacks. The survivors sued Arab Bank in New York federal court under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), which provides for federal district court jurisdiction over civil actions brought by aliens. Arab Bank moved to dismiss the ATS claims under the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit’s decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. In that case, the appellate court held that the ATS does not authorize claims against foreign corporations. The district court acknowledged that, because the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Kiobel on other grounds and had not addressed the question of corporate liability, the court of appeals’ holding was still controlling precedent and therefore dismissed the ATS claims. On appeal, the appellate court noted that the Supreme Court’s decision did cast some doubt on the corporate liability holding in Kiobel. However, because the Supreme Court had not addressed the question of corporate liability, the appellate court  affirmed the lower court’s dismissal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Alien Tort Statute prohibit corporate liability?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not permit lawsuits against corporations. Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court found that the original purpose of the ATS was to ensure that federal courts of the United States were available venues for foreign nationals alleging violations of international law and thereby to assuage potential foreign-relations issues. The Court reasoned that in this case, to allow the lawsuit to proceed would have the opposite policy effect, straining diplomatic relations with Jordan. If Congress wants to allow for lawsuits against foreign corporations in these types of circumstances, Congress should explicitly do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurrence in which he concluded that there are two additional reasons the lawsuit should be dismissed—that the ATS is a jurisdictional statute that does not create a new cause of action and that federal courts should require a domestic defendant before hearing a lawsuit under the ATS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan joined. Justice Sotomayor wrote that the text, history, and purpose of the ATS support the conclusion that corporations may be sued under the law and that the Court\u0027s decision absolves corporations of responsibility for egregious human rights abuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30283,"name":"Jeffrey L.

Ayestas appealed his conviction and filed for state habeas relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; he argued that his trial counsel failed to secure the testimony of family members who could have presented mitigating evidence. The state habeas court found that Ayestas’ trial attorney was not ineffective and denied his application for habeas relief. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the findings of the state habeas court and denied relief as well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2009, Ayestas, with a new attorney, filed a federal habeas petition and claimed that his trial counsel had been ineffective because he had failed to conduct a reasonable investigation that would have uncovered “available and abundant” mitigating factors. However, the district court found that his claim was procedurally defaulted because it had not been raised in the state habeas proceeding and denied relief. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The US Supreme Court subsequently decided \u003cem\u003eMartinez v. Ryan\u003c/em\u003e, which held that ineffectiveness of state habeas counsel in failing to bring an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim may excuse a procedural default. The Supreme Court later extended the holding of \u003cem\u003eMartinez\u003c/em\u003e to Texas’ habeas scheme in \u003cem\u003eTrevino v. Thaler\u003c/em\u003e. In light of these decisions, Ayestas asked for a rehearing. On rehearing in the district court, Ayestas filed a motion for investigative assistance that was “reasonably necessary” to develop his broader ineffective assistance of counsel claim under 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f). The district court denied the motion based on Fifth Circuit precedent that holds that investigative assistance is not “reasonably necessary” unless the habeas petitioner can carry the ultimate burden of proof on the underlying claim at the time of the request for investigative assistance. The district court determined that Ayestas could not meet his burden of proof on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and therefore denied the motion. The appellate court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre investigative services under 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f) only “reasonably necessary” when the habeas petitioner requesting the services can meet the burden of proof for the underlying claim for habeas relief at the time of the request for the investigative services?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Alito, after explaining that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal because it related to a judicial rather than an administrative decision, the Court held that the Fifth Circuit applied the wrong legal standard in affirming the denial of Ayestas\u0027 claim for the investigative funding needed to prove his entitlement to federal habeas relief under 18 USC § 3599(f). Analyzing the statutory language, the Court concluded that it called for district courts to exercise their discretion in determining whether a reasonable attorney would deem the services sought by the funding to be sufficiently important to the case in order to meet the \"reasonably necessary\" requirement. The Fifth Circuit\u0027s \"substantial need\" standard was more stringent, and therefore improper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that the Fifth Circuit also erred in requiring Ayestas to present \"a viable constitutional claim that [was] not procedurally barred,\" as this rule had become too restrictive in light of \u003cem\u003eTrevino\u003c/em\u003e, and lower courts could potentially err in denying funding requests in cases where such funding could allow a petitioner to overcome a procedural default. On the other hand, the Court also explained that district courts had broad discretion in ruling on § 3599(f) funding requests, and while a funding applicant need not prove that they will win their case due to the funding services, the courts must evaluate the likelihood of success as part of the \"reasonably necessary\" test. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court remanded to the Fifth Circuit the state\u0027s alternative argument that § 3599(f) funding is never \"reasonably necessary\" when a petitioner for habeas relief seeks to bring a procedurally defaulted ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim based on facts outside the state court record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion, in which Justice Ginsburg joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":56070,"name":"Scott A.

In 2001, the Tribe petitioned for a tract of land called the Bradley Property to be put into trust for the Tribe’s use under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), 25 U.S.C. § 465, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs granted the petition in 2005.

That lawsuit was argued up to the U.S. Supreme Court on a threshold issue of standing, and after the Supreme Court held that Patchak had standing to sue, President Obama signed into law the Gun Lake Act, which provided, among other things, that any legal action relating to the Bradley Property “shall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court and shall be promptly dismissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a statute that directs the federal courts to “promptly dismiss” a pending lawsuit but that does not amend the underlying substantive or procedural laws violate the Constitution’s separation of powers principles?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a plurality opinion authored by Justice Thomas, the Court affirmed the ruling by the D.C. Circuit, concluding that Section 2(b) of the Gun Lake Act did not violate Article III of the Constitution. The Court stated that it was not an impermissible exercise of legislative power for Congress to change the law applicable to pending lawsuits, even if it made one side much more likely to prevail. The Court distinguished this scenario from legislative attempts to compel a particular result under old law, which would have violated Article III. The Court explained that by stripping federal courts of jurisdiction in actions relating to the property at issue, §2(b) “changed” the law, and that making this type of change was a valid exercise of legislative power. Justice Breyer filed a concurring opinion. Justice Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion, and Justice Sotomayor joined. Justice Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justice Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, and Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62840,"name":"Scott E.

The exchange took place through Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, the escrow agent, and Valley View borrowed money from Credit Suisse and other lenders to pay for the shares. Shortly thereafter, Valley View filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003eFTI Consulting, Inc., as Trustee of the litigation trust that includes Valley View as one of the debtors, brought this lawsuit against Merit Management Group, a 30% shareholder in Bedford Downs. FTI seeks to avoid Bedford\u0027s $16.5 million transfer to Valley View under Bankruptcy Code sections 544, 548(a)(1)(b), and 550, which are safe harbor provisions for transfers \"made by or to\" certain enumerated entities. It is undisputed that Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank are financial institutions within the language of the statute, but at issue is whether the language “made by or to” includes institutions that act merely as a conduit for the transfer and do not benefit from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seventh Circuit held that section 546(e) does not provide a safe harbor against avoidance of transfers between non-named entities where a named entity merely acts as a conduit for the transfer. The Eleventh Circuit has interpreted the provision in the same way as the Seventh, while the Second, Third, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits have held to the contrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the safe harbor of Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibit avoidance of a transfer made by or to a financial institution, regardless of whether the institution benefits from the transfer?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, the safe harbor provision of Section 546(e) of the Bankruptcy Code does not provide a safe harbor against avoidance of transfers between non-named entities where a named entity merely acts as a conduit for the transfer. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. The language of §546(e) and the specific context in which it is used support the conclusion that the relevant transfer for purposes of the safe-harbor inquiry is the transfer the trustee seeks to avoid. The statutory structure also supports this interpretation. Applying that interpretation to the facts of the case, the Court found that because the parties do not contend that either Valley View or Merit is a covered entity, the transfer falls outside of the §546(e) safe harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62844,"name":"Brian C.

While the PTAB contended that it need only have addressed certain challenged claims, rather than every challenged claim, SAS alleged that the PTAB in fact misconstrued a claim term, as well as erred by not addressing all the claims SAS challenged in its original petition.\u2028\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder 35 U.S.C. § 318(a), must the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in its final written decision address every claim that is challenged in the petition, or may said decision merely address a subset of those claims?\u2028\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 opinion the Court reversed and remanded, holding that when the United States Patent and Trademark Office institutes an inter partes review to reconsider an already-issued patent claim, under 35 U.S.C. §§311–319, it must decide the patentability of all of the claims the petitioner has challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Gorsuch authored the majority opinion, stating that the plain text of the statute decided the question in this case. The Court explained that § 318(a)\u0027s use of the words \"shall\" and \"any\" imposed a mandatory and comprehensive directive. Thus, if the statutory language provided that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\u0027s \"final written decision \u0027shall\u0027 resolve the patentability of \u0027any patent claim challenged by the petitioner,\u0027 it mean[t] the Board must address every claim the petitioner . . . challenged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court went on to state that § 312(a)(3) envisioned a review process guided by the petitioner rather than the agency. And while the agency director had the authority to reexamine any patentability questions on an ex parte basis at any time under § 303(a), Congress structured the inter partes review statute to provide the director with simply a \"yes or no\" choice as to whether to review pursuant to a given petition.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court rejected the notion that efficiency considerations justified a claim-by-claim approach, characterizing this as a policy argument better suited for legislative than judicial consideration. It also found unpersuasive the idea that any \"partial institution\" power asserted by the director was not entitled to Chevron deference. Finally, the opinion noted that judicial review pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act remained available in the event that the agency acted outside the confines of its statutory authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Ginsburg authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor.

Under this process, voters who have not voted for two years are sent notices to confirm their registration. If the state receives no response and these individuals do not vote over the next four years, they are ultimately removed from the rolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaintiffs are various civil rights groups that are challenging the process, claiming that it is not only inappropriate to remove individuals from the voter rolls as a consequence of failing to vote but also violates part of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The Act prohibits a program for voter-list maintenance for federal elections that involves “the removal of the name of any personal from the official list of voters . . . by reason of the person’s failure to vote.” Plaintiffs believe that the Supreme Court should involve itself and determine whether this process violates the Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit previously struck down these rules, deeming them a violation of federal voting law because Ohio\u0027s process involves using an individual\u0027s failure to vote as a \"trigger\" for sending out a confirmation notice to that person. Plaintiffs consequently argue that there is no reason to disturb the appellate court decision. Defendants argue that Ohio is adhering to federal voter law, as set forth in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA).\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Ohio’s list-maintenance process permissible under 52 U.S.C. § 20507, given that it relies on the inactivity of a registered voter as a \"trigger\" to send a confirmation notice to that voter under the NVRA and HAVA?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eOhio\u0027s list-maintenance process does not violate any provision of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) or the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA). In a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Samuel Alito, the Court found that Ohio\u0027s procedure of requiring (1) a failure to vote for two years, (2) a failure to return a notice card, and (3) a failure to vote for four additional years was sufficiently rigorous under NVRA and its amended versions. The Court reasoned that by the plain language of the statute, NVRA forbids removal of a voter if failure to vote is the sole reason for removal. While Ohio list-maintenance process does use failure to vote as a trigger for removal, because it is not the sole basis for removal, it does not violate the statute. Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in full but wrote separately to offer constitutional reasons for rejecting the proposed interpretation of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion in which Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. The dissent argued that the Ohio process does in fact rely on failure to vote to purge voter lists and that the additional requirement of responding to a mailed notice does not mitigate this violation of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sotomayor wrote a separate dissenting opinion arguing that the majority\u0027s decision ignores the driving purpose behind the NVRA—to address voter suppression laws—and pointing to statistics from amicus briefs showing that the law has a disproportionate effect of unregistering substantially more African American voters as compared to suburban white voters.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62682,"name":"Eric E.

One of the men confessed to the crimes and gave the FBI his cell phone number and the numbers of the other participants. The FBI used this information to apply for three orders from magistrate judges to obtain \"transactional records\" for each of the phone numbers, which the judges granted under the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. 2703(d). That Act provides that the government may require the disclosure of certain telecommunications records when \"specific and articulable facts show[] that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\" The transactional records obtained by the government include the date and time of calls, and the approximate location where calls began and ended based on their connections to cell towers—\"cell site\" location information (CSLI).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the cell-site evidence, the government charged Timothy Carpenter with, among other offenses, aiding and abetting robbery that affected interstate commerce, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. 1951. Carpenter moved to suppress the government\u0027s cell-site evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, arguing that the FBI needed a warrant based on probable cause to obtain the records. The district court denied the motion to suppress, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the warrantless search and seizure of cell phone records, which include the location and movements of cell phone users, violate the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe government\u0027s warrantless acquisition of Carpenter\u0027s cell-site records violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The majority first acknowledged that the Fourth Amendment protects not only property interests, but also reasonable expectations of privacy. Expectations of privacy in this age of digital data do not fit neatly into existing precedents, but tracking person\u0027s movements and location through extensive cell-site records is far more intrusive than the precedents might have anticipated. The Court declined to extend the \"third-party doctrine\"—a doctrine where information disclosed to a third party carries no reasonable expectation of privacy—to cell-site location information, which implicates even greater privacy concerns than GPS tracking does. One consideration in the development of the third-party doctrine was the \"nature of the particular documents sought,\" and the level of intrusiveness of extensive cell-site data weighs against application of the doctrine to this type of information. Additionally, the third-party doctrine applies to voluntary exposure, and while a user might be abstractly aware that his cell phone provider keeps logs, it happens without any affirmative act on the user\u0027s part. Thus, the Court held narrowly that the government generally will need a warrant to access cell-site location information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined. Justice Kennedy would find that cell-site records are no different from the many other kinds of business records the government has a lawful right to obtain by compulsory process. Justice Kennedy would continue to limit the Fourth Amendment to its property-based origins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, emphasizing the property-based approach to Fourth Amendment questions. In Justice Thomas\u0027s view, the case should not turn on whether a search occurred, but whose property was searched. By focusing on this latter question, Justice Thomas reasoned, the only logical conclusion would be that the information did not belong to Carpenter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Thomas joined. Justice Alito distinguishes between an actual search and an order \"merely requiring a party to look through its own records and produce specified documents\"—with the former being far more intrusive than the latter. Justice Alito criticizes the majority for what he characterizes as \"allow[ing] a defendant to object to the search of a third party\u0027s property,\" a departure from long-standing Fourth Amendment doctrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion in which he emphasizes the \"original understanding\" of the Fourth Amendment and laments the Court\u0027s departure from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62850,"name":"Nathan Freed Wessler","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/nathan_freed_wessler","view_count":0,"last_name":"Wessler","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"nathan_freed_wessler"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22284"},{"advocate":{"ID":35719,"name":"Michael R.

However, the wellheads that sit on top of oil and gas wells are not designed to withstand continuous exposure to fracking fluids and can sustain significant damage as a result. In an attempt to address this issue, Stinger Wellhead Protection Inc., a subsidiary of Oil States Energy Services, first tried using a design described in Canadian Patent Application No. 2,195,118 (the ’118 Application) that relies on using hydraulic pressure first to push a “mandrel” into the wellhead through which the fracking fluid could be pumped without contacting the wellhead equipment. That method failed to sufficiently address the issue, so the Oil States subsidiary attempted a different method using a mechanical lockdown mechanism (described in Patent No. 6,179,053, or the ’053 Patent), rather than hydraulic pressure. In 2012, Oil States filed a patent infringement suit against Greene’s Energy Group, during the course of which litigation the district court found the ’053 Patent to be distinct from the ’118 Application using the “ordinary meaning” standard. Greene’s filed for inter partes review, which is a process used by the Patent and Trademark Office where one party asks the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board to reconsider the PTO’s issuance of an existing patent and invalidate it on the ground that it was anticipated by prior art or obvious. Oil States challenges the practice of inter partes review as violating the constitutional right of patent owners to a jury and an Article III forum before having their patent invalidated. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes inter partes review violate the Constitution by depriving patent holders of their property rights without providing them a jury and an Article III forum?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court affirmed the Federal Circuit’s ruling, holding that the the Patent and Trademark Office’s inter partes review process did not violate Article III or the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting for the majority in a 7-2 decision, Justice Thomas explained that inter partes review falls precisely within the public rights doctrine, with the grant of a patent being a matter involving public rights, and inter partes review involving the same basic matter as the grant of a patent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opinion went on to clarify that three of the Court’s holdings under the Patent Act of 1870 recognizing patent rights as the “private property of the patentee” did not contradict this conclusion. The Court also explained that despite a history of patent disputes being decided by the judicial system in 19th-century England, inter partes review did not violate the principle that Congress may not remove matters of common law from judicial purview. The opinion further noted that just because American courts have typically decided patent disputes, they need not always do so, as matters governed by the public rights doctrine may be assigned to any of the three branches of government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court stated that it has never adopted a “looks like” test to establish whether a matter was properly decided outside of an Article III court, meaning that drawing similarities between the inter partes review process and that of a court was inconsequential here. It also emphasized that its holding was narrow, and should not be misconstrued to suggest that patents are not property pursuant to the Due Process Clause or the Takings Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the Court held that inter partes review does not run afoul of the Seventh Amendment, explaining that when Congress properly assigns a matter to a non-Article III entity, the Seventh Amendment does not create an independent barrier to that body’s adjudication of the dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Breyer authored a concurring opinion, which was joined by Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor. Justice Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice Roberts.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":56044,"name":"Allyson N.

As a result, the Republican leadership developed a voting district map that its drafters calculated would allow Republicans to maintain a majority under any likely voting scenario. The redistricting plan was introduced in July 2011, and both the senate and the assembly passed the bill shortly thereafter. The governor signed the bill into law in August 2011. Even before it was enacted, the plan faced two legal challenges, on constitutional and statutory grounds. A federal court upheld the plan as not violating the “one person one vote” principle nor violating the Equal Protection Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaintiffs in this case challenge the plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. At issue is whether the plan systematically dilutes the voting strength of Democratic voters statewide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid the district court err in holding that it had the authority to hear a statewide challenge to Wisconsin\u0027s redistricting plan, rather than requiring a district-by-district analysis?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the district court err in holding that the redistricting plan was an unconstitutional gerrymander?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the district court use an incorrect test for a gerrymander?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAre defendants entitled to present evidence that they would have prevailed under the gerrymander test actually used by the district court?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAre partisan gerrymandering claims justiciable?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe plaintiffs failed to demonstrate Article III standing, so there is no need to resolve any of the questions presented. In a unanimous decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court sidestepped (for now) all of the key issues regarding partisan gerrymandering, resolving the case instead on the technical issue of judicial standing. For a plaintiff to bring a case in federal court, she must have Article III standing, which requires showing three elements, one of which is \"injury in fact.\" To show injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that she has suffered \"invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized.\" In this case, the Court found that the plaintiffs alleged but did not prove individual harms, providing evidence instead only of statewide harms of alleged partisan gerrymandering. The Court thus vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded for further proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch did not join the majority with respect to the decision to remand the case and allow the plaintiffs a second chance to prove standing and thus wrote separately to express this disagreement with the disposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Kagan agreed with the findings and conclusions of the Court but wrote separately, in essence, to describe how the plaintiffs might proceed upon remand. Justice Kagan suggests that the plaintiffs might present more than simply a vote dilution theory, but also an infringement of their First Amendment right of association. Such a claim, according to Justice Kagan, would not require the plaintiffs to show injury-in-fact in the form of injury to her particular voting district because that claim would be statewide in nature. She predicts that partisan gerrymandering \"injures enough individuals and organizations in enough concrete ways . . . that standing requirements, properly applied, will not often or long prevent courts from reaching the merits of cases like this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62823,"name":"Misha Tseytlin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/misha_tseytlin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Tseytlin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"misha_tseytlin"},"advocate_description":"for the appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22294"},{"advocate":{"ID":38319,"name":"Paul M.

Congress then passed the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which precluded certain state law securities class actions, and amended the 1933 Act to reflect that limitation on state court claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeaver County Employees\u0027 Retirement Fund filed a lawsuit in a California superior court asserting claims under the 1933 Act. Cyan Inc. moved to dismiss the claims, arguing that the amended 1933 Act precluded state courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over 1933 Act claims entirely. The superior court rejected Cyan\u0027s objection to the exercise of jurisdiction. Federal district courts are split as to whether state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over covered class actions that allege only 1933 Act claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over covered class actions that allege only Securities Act of 1933 claims?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA) does not strip state courts of jurisdiction to hear claims under the Securities Act of 1933, nor does it permit defendants to remove class actions alleging only 1933 Act claims from state to federal court. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Elena Kagan, the Court found that the language of SLUSA, which modifies the Securities Act of 1933, leaves the state courts\u0027 jurisdiction intact. The background rule of § 77v(a) gives state courts concurrent jurisdiction over all suits “brought to enforce any liability or duty created by” that statute. Section 77p, which bars certain securities class actions based on state law, controls if there is a conflict between § 77v(a) and § 77p, but §77p does nothing to limit state-court jurisdiction over class actions brought under the 1933 Act. The Court also found that the structure and context also support its reading of the provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 1933 Act barred the removal of certain claims from state to federal court. Section 77p(c) of SLUSA modifies the removal ban, permitting the removal of certain class actions to federal court, where they are subject to dismissal. The Court found that the most natural reading of that provision does not alter the ban on removal of class actions alleging only 1933 Act claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37171,"name":"Neal Kumar Katyal","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/neal_kumar_katyal","view_count":0,"last_name":"Katyal","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"neal_kumar_katyal"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22387"},{"advocate":{"ID":42731,"name":"Thomas C.

Phillips, design and create a cake for their wedding. Phillips declined to do so on the grounds that he does not create wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious beliefs. Phillips believes that decorating cakes is a form of art through which he can honor God and that it would displease God to create cakes for same-sex marriages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraig and Mullins filed charges of discrimination with the Colorado Civil Rights Division, alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), §§ 24-34-301 to -804, C.R.S. 2014. After the Division issued a notice of determination finding probable cause, Craig and Mullins filed a formal complaint with the Office of Administrative Courts alleging that Masterpiece discriminated against them in a place of public accommodation in violation of CADA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Administrative Law Judge issued a written order finding in favor of Craig and Mullins, which was affirmed by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. On appeal, the Colorado Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed the Commission\u0027s ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the application of Colorado\u0027s public accommodations law to compel a cake maker to design and make a cake that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs about same-sex marriage violate the Free Speech or Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed in a 7-2 decision, holding that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\u0027s conduct in evaluating a cake shop owner\u0027s reasons for declining to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple violated the Free Exercise Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that while gay persons and same-sex couples are afforded civil rights protections under the laws and the Constitution, religious and philosophical objections to same-sex marriage are protected views and can also be protected forms of expression. The Colorado law at issue in this case, which prohibited discrimination against gay people in purchasing products and services, had to be applied in a neutral manner with regard to religion. The majority acknowledged that from Phillips\u0027 perspective, creating cakes was a form of artistic expression and a component of his sincere religious beliefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court also explained that in 2012, the year that Phillips refused his services to Craig and Mullins, the law in Colorado and across the country with regard to same sex marriage was much more unsettled than it became after \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Windsor\u003c/em\u003e, 570 US 744 (2013) and \u003cem\u003eObergefell v. Hodges\u003c/em\u003e, 576 US ___ (2015). At the time, the State Civil Rights Division had also concluded in at least three other cases that bakers had acted lawfully in declining to make cakes that included messages they disagreed with, specifically messages demeaning gay persons. Thus it was not unreasonable for Phillips to believe that he was acting lawfully at the time, and his claims before the Commission were entitled to neutral treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Court stated that Phillips did not receive this neutral treatment, with members of the Commission showing clear and impermissible hostility toward his religious beliefs. The Court explained that commissioners\u0027 comments disparaging Phillips\u0027 beliefs and characterizing them as rhetorical were inappropriate, though these comments were not mentioned or disavowed in subsequent legal proceedings. The Court concluded that these comments cast doubt on the fairness of the Commission\u0027s consideration of Phillips\u0027 claims. The Court also pointed out that disparities between Phillips\u0027 case and those of other bakers with objections to making cakes with anti-gay messages, and who were victorious before the Commission, further reflected hostility toward the religious basis for Phillips\u0027 position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court concluded that the Commission\u0027s actions violated the State\u0027s duty under the First Amendment not to use hostility toward religion or a religious viewpoint as a basis for laws or regulations. Under the facts of this case, the Court determined that Phillips\u0027 religious justification for his refusal to serve Craig and Mullins was not afforded the neutral treatment mandated by the Free Exercise Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Ginsburg authored a dissenting opinion, in which she was joined by Justice Sotomayor, stating that neither the Commission\u0027s comments regarding Phillips\u0027 religious views nor its alleged disparate treatment of bakers objecting to making cakes with anti-gay messages justified ruling in favor of Phillips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Kagan filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Breyer, in which she agreed with the majority that the Commission had not given neutral treatment to Phillips\u0027 religious views, but declined to assign any significance to the Commission\u0027s treatment of bakers who refused to create cakes with anti-gay messages because she believed that this did not violate the Colorado law at issue in Phillips\u0027 case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Gorsuch also filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Alito, in which he argued that the cases of Phillips and the bakers who objected to using anti-gay messages in their baking were quite similar, and the Commission acted inappropriately in treating them differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, and was joined by Justice Gorsuch. Thomas argued that an order requiring Phillips to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple would violate his First Amendment rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62928,"name":"Kristen Kellie Waggoner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/kristen_kellie_waggoner","view_count":0,"last_name":"Waggoner","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"kristen_kellie_waggoner"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22299"},{"advocate":{"ID":37093,"name":"Noel J.

Included in PASPA are exceptions for state-sponsored sports wagering in Nevada and sports lotteries in Oregon and Delaware, as well as for New Jersey, provided that New Jersey also enact a sports gambling scheme within one year of PASPA\u0027s enactment, which it did not do. PASPA also permits any sports league whose games are or will be the subject of sports gambling to bring an action to enjoin the gambling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2011, the New Jersey Legislature held a referendum asking voters whether sports gambling should be permitted, and 64 percent voted in favor of a state constitutional amendment that would permit sports gambling. The legislature then drafted and received voter approval of a sports-wagering constitutional amendment, after which time, in 2012, it enacted the Sports Wagering Act (\"2012 Act\"), which authorized certain regulated sports wagering at New Jersey casinos and racetracks and implemented a comprehensive regulatory scheme for licensing casinos and sporting events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive sports leagues sued under PASPA to enjoin the New Jersey law, which the state defended by arguing that PASPA was unconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine. The district court held that PASPA was constitutional and enjoined the 2012 Act. The legislature passed a second law (\"2014 Law\") that purported to repeal the regulatory scheme for licensing casinos and sporting events, effectively providing tacit authorization of them. The leagues again sued to enjoin the 2014 Law, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the leagues and issued a permanent injunction against the governor and other state agencies. A divided panel of the Third Circuit affirmed, and upon rehearing, the Third Circuit en banc affirmed the majority opinion of the panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a federal statute that prohibits modification or repeal of state-law prohibitions on private conduct impermissibly commandeer the regulatory power of states in contravention of New York v. United States?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Alito, the court reversed in favor of the State of New Jersey, finding that PASPA\u0027s provision prohibiting state authorization of sports gambling schemes violates the anticommandeering doctrine under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution as interpreted under \u003cem\u003eNew York v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, 505 U.S. 144 (1992) and \u003cem\u003ePrintz v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, 521 U.S. 898 (1997). Pursuant to this authority, “Congress may not simply ‘commandeer the legislative process of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.’\" \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn so holding, the Court explained that when a state fully or partially repeals old laws prohibiting sports gambling schemes, as New Jersey did in enacting the 2014 Law, it \"authorizes\" those schemes under PASPA. The Court also explained that there was no meaningful difference between directing a state legislature to enact a new law or prohibiting a state legislature from doing so, and PASPA\u0027s anti-authorization provision violated the anticommandeering principle because it specifically mandated what a state could and could not do. The Court stated that complying with the anticommandeering rule is important because it serves as one of the Constitution\u0027s structural safeguards of liberty, advances political accountability, and prevents Congress from shifting regulatory costs to the states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court further held that no provision of PASPA is directly severable from those at issue in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Breyer joined the majority opinion as to all except Part VI-B, and filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Justice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Sotomayor joined, and Justice Breyer joined in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43165,"name":"Theodore B.

Debtor defaulted on the larger of the two loans, and the creditors initiated foreclosure proceedings, and, in an effort to resolve the loans, entered into a settlement agreement that involved selling the debt to PEM Entities for a significantly discounted price. PEM\u0027s members did not participate in the negotiation of the settlement agreement, despite that the settlement agreement affected the rights and property of PEM. After several transactions among the parties involved in the settlement agreement, Debtor filed its bankruptcy petition in March 2013. It listed PEM\u0027s claim at $7 million,  the principal and the accrued interest of the loan that PEM bought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong other determinations, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to creditors Eric M. Levin and Howard Shareff on their equitable claim of recharacterization, noting that PEM\u0027s discounted loan purchase was a settlement and satisfaction of the original loan to Debtor.

Among the injured were eight U.S. citizens, who consequently filed a lawsuit against the Islamic Republic of Iran for its role in providing material support to the attackers. In general, sovereign governments are immune from lawsuit, but the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\") provides an exception to that immunity in cases of state-sponsored of terrorism. A district judge in D.C. entered a $71.5 million default judgment against Iran, which Iran did not pay. The plaintiffs then litigated numerous cases across the country in an attempt to attach and execute on Iranian assets to satisfy the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe case at hand involves four collections of ancient Persian artifacts within the possession of the University of Chicago and Chicago\u0027s Field Museum of Natural History. With few exceptions, a foreign state\u0027s property in the United States is immune from attachment and execution. The plaintiffs argued before the district court that they should be able to attach and execute Iran\u0027s property under subsections (a) and (g) of 28 U.S.C. § 1610, as well as section 201 of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (\"TRIA\"). The district court held, and the Seventh Circuit agreed, that while § 1610(a) permits execution on a foreign state\u0027s property \"used for a commercial activity in the United States,\" that provision requires use by the foreign state itself, not a third party (such as a museum). The district court also held, and the Seventh Circuit agreed, that § 1610(g) permits attachment to property of a foreign state in aid of execution only in cases described elsewhere in § 1610, rendering that provision unavailable to the plaintiffs in this case. Finally, the district court held, and the Seventh Circuit agreed, that § 201 of TRIA applies only to assets blocked by executive order, and in the absence of an executive order blocking the particular assets sought, plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of that provision either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seventh Circuit\u0027s holding thus conflicts with the Ninth Circuit\u0027s prior holding that § 1610(g) provides a freestanding attachment immunity exception that allows terrorism victims to attach and execute upon any assets of foreign state sponsors of terrorism, regardless of whether the assets are otherwise subject to execution under section 1610.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes 28 U.S.C. § 1610(g) provide a freestanding attachment immunity exception that allows terror victim judgment creditors to attach and execute upon assets of foreign state sponsors of terrorism regardless of whether assets are otherwise subject to execution under Section 1610?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, Section 1610(g) does not provide a freestanding basis for parties to attach and execute against the property of a foreign state. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion for the 8-0 unanimous Court. Looking first at the statutory text, the Court found that the most natural reading of Section 1610(g)(1)—that certain property will be \"subject to attachment in aid of execution, and execution, upon [a §1605A] judgment as provided in this section\"—is that there must be an indepedent basis for the withdrawal of property immunity. To conclude otherwise would have rendered the other provisions of §1610(g) superfluous because any plaintiff with a §1605A judgment could seek property attachment under §1610(g) regardless of whether the conditions of any those provisions were met. The Court\u0027s interpretation is also consistent with the historical practice of rescinding attachment and execution immunity primarily in the context of a foreign state\u0027s commercial acts. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62873,"name":"Asher Perlin","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/asher_perlin","view_count":0,"last_name":"Perlin","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"asher_perlin"},"advocate_description":"for petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22305"},{"advocate":{"ID":21501,"name":"David A.

Marinello II owned and operated a freight service that couriered items to and from the United States and Canada. Between 1992 and 2010, Marinello did not keep an accounting of his business, nor did he file personal or corporate income tax returns. Indeed, he shredded bank statements and business records. After an investigation by the IRS, Marinello was indicted by a grand jury on nine counts of tax-related offenses, and a jury found him guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to 36 months in prison, one year of parole, and was ordered to pay over $350,000 to the IRS in restitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the counts of which Marinello was charged and convicted was violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), which imposes criminal liability on one who \"in any . . . way corruptly . . . obstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due administration of this title.\" Marinello appealed his conviction on the grounds that the phrase \"the due administration of this title\" requires the defendant be aware of IRS action, and the government provided no evidence at trial that Marinello knew of a pending IRS investigation against him. Finding that knowledge of a pending investigation is not an element of the offense of which Marinello was convicted, the Second Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a conviction under 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a) for corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or impede the due administration of the tax laws require that the government prove the defendant acted with knowledge of a pending Internal Revenue Service action?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe federal crime of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or impede the due administration of the tax laws, 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), requires proof that the defendant acted with knowledge of a pending Internal Revenue Service action. Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the opinion for the 7-2 majority. Justice Breyer found that in the past, the Court had interpreted similar criminal statutes to require a \"nexus\" between the defendant\u0027s obstructive conduct and a particular judicial proceeding. Given that the key words in the statute \"obstruct\" and \"impede\" require an object the taxpayer must act with respect to a particular person or thing of which he is aware. Moreover, just because a taxpayer knows that the IRS will review his tax return does not mean that every Tax Code violation constitutes obstruction. Rather, in addition to satisfying the nexus requirement, the government must also demonstrate that the proceeding was pending at the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive conduct or at least was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas authored a separate dissent in which Justice Samuel Alito joined. Justice Thomas found that the plain language of the statute forbids \"corrupt efforts to impede the IRS from performing any of these activities\" and does not require that the defendant acted with knowledge of a pending IRS action.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62300,"name":"Matthew S.

Somers then sued Digital Realty, alleging violations of state and federal laws, including Section 21F of the Exchange Act, which includes the anti-retaliation protections created by the Dodd-Frank Act. Digital Realty sought to dismiss the Section 21F claim on the ground that, because Somers did not actually report the possible violations to the SEC, he was not a \"whistleblower\" as defined in the Act and thus not entitled to protection under its provisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fifth Circuit in 2013 had strictly applied the Act\u0027s definition of \"whistleblower\" to the anti-retaliation provision, while the Second Circuit, finding the statute itself ambiguous and applying \u003cem\u003eChevron\u003c/em\u003e deference to the SEC\u0027s reasonable interpretation of it, had held in 2015 that the provision extends to all those who make disclosures of suspected violations, regardless of whether the disclosures are made internally or to the SEC. The district court in this case followed the Second Circuit\u0027s approach and denied Digital Realty\u0027s motion to dismiss. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u0027s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the anti-retaliation provision for \"whistleblowers\" in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 extend protection to individuals who have not reported alleged misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission and thus fall outside the act’s definition of \"whistleblower\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, the anti-retaliation provision for \"whistleblowers\" in the Dodd-Frank Act protects only individuals who report alleged misconduct to the SEC. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court. The Act explicitly defines whistleblowers as any individual who provides pertinent information \"to the Commission,\" and this definition is corroborated by Dodd-Frank\u0027s purpose to aid the SEC\u0027s enforcement efforts by incentivizing people to tell the SEC about violations. Individuals who report violations to any other federal agency, Congress, or an internal supervisor, are not within the scope of this express definition of whistleblower in the Dodd-Frank Act. Because the language of the statute is not ambiguous, the SEC\u0027s contrary view is not entitled to \u003cem\u003eChevron\u003c/em\u003e deference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, in which Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch joined, in which he joined the majority in its reading of the statutory text of the Dodd-Frank Act, but not as to the majority\u0027s use of a Senate Report to determine the purpose of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion, in which Justice Stephen Breyer joined. Justice Sotomayor joined the Court\u0027s opinion in full but noted her disagreement with Justice Thomas\u0027s suggestion in his concurrence that a Senate Report is not an appropriate source for the Court to consider when interpreting a statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33978,"name":"Kannon K.

In July 2011, correctional officers hit Murphy, fracturing his eye socket, and did not provide him proper medical attention. Murphy sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law theories. A jury returned a verdict in his favor and awarded him damages for some of his claims under state law, and the district court awarded him attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Two of the defendants appealed the judgment, arguing that the Illinois doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the state-law claims and that the Prison Litigation Reform Act requires that 25 percent of the damages awarded be used to pay the attorney fee award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u0027s holding that the state officials or employees are not entitled to sovereign immunity against state-law claims where the officials or employees violated statutory or constitutional law, which violations Murphy alleged and proved. The Seventh Circuit reversed on the attorney fee award, however, finding that the 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d) requires that the attorney fee award must first be satisfied from up to 25 percent of the damage award and that the district court does not have discretion to reduce that maximum percentage.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the parenthetical phrase “not to exceed 25 percent,” as used in 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(2), mean any amount up to 25 percent (as four circuits hold), or exactly 25 percent (as the Seventh Circuit holds)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe phrase \"not to exceed 25 percent\" as used in 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d)(2) with respect to the award of attorneys fees in a civil rights suit means that the district court must use as much of the judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award without exceeding the 25% limit, as the Seventh Circuit held. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The language of the provision, including the words \"shall\" and use of the infinitive phrase \"to satisfy the amount of attorney\u0027s fees awarded\" indicated the mandatory, rather than discretionary, nature of the provision\u0027s command to the district court. The majority also found that the statutory scheme, including Congress\u0027s intent in enacting a new and different law for prisoner rights suits, as well as the surrounding provisions, supported this reading of the statute. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan joined. In the dissent\u0027s view, the plain language of the provision at issue should give district courts the discretion to allocate a portion of a prisoner-plaintiff’s monetary judgment to an attorney’s fee award, provided that the portion is not greater than 25 percent. In support of its position, the dissent points to language considered but not accepted by Congress that more clearly supports the respondent-prisoners\u0027 interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62791,"name":"Stuart Banner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/stuart_banner","view_count":0,"last_name":"Banner","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"stuart_banner"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22329"},{"advocate":{"ID":62929,"name":"Brett E.

Recognizing the car as a rental car, the officers asked Byrd for his license and rental agreement, which he had difficulty locating. Once he did locate them, the officers noted that the rental agreement did not list Byrd as an authorized driver, and when they ran his identification, they noted that he was using an alias and had an outstanding warrant in New Jersey. Despite the warrant’s indication that it did not request extradition from other jurisdictions, the officers attempted to contact authorities in New Jersey to confirm they did not seek Byrd’s arrest and extradition, allegedly following protocol for such situations. The officers experienced difficulty with their communications, however, and returned to Byrd’s car, where they asked him to exit the vehicle and about his warrant and alias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officers asked whether Byrd had anything illegal in the car and then requested Byrd’s consent to search the car, noting that they did not actually need his consent because he was not listed on the rental agreement. The officers allege that Byrd gave his consent, but Byrd disputes this contention. The subsequent search turned up heroin and body armor in the trunk of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Byrd moved to suppress the evidence, challenging the initial stop, the extension of the stop, and the search. The district court determined that the violation of the traffic law justified the initial stop and that the extension of the stop was justified by the officers’ developing reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Byrd maintains that he did not consent to the search, so the issue remains whether he needed to consent at all—that is, whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle, despite not being listed on the rental agreement. If he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, then the officers’ search of the vehicle did not require his consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a circuit split as to whether an unlisted driver of a rental car has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental vehicle, and the Third Circuit (where the district court in this case sits) has held that such a driver does not. Thus, the district court denied Byrd’s motion to suppress, and the Third Circuit, reviewing the factual questions for clear error and the legal question de novo, affirmed the judgment of the district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a driver have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a rental car when he has the renter\u0027s permission to drive the car but is not listed as an authorized driver on the rental agreement?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court held that a driver of a rental car who has the renter\u0027s permission to drive it but is not listed as an authorized driver on the rental agreement does have a reasonable expectation of privacy against government searches of the vehicle. Although such a driver does not have a property interest in the car, property principles inform the reasoning behind this conclusion. A driver who has the permission of the lawful possessor or owner of the car has complete \"dominion and control\" over the property and can rightfully exclude others from it. The Court analogized to the situation in Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 (1960), where the Court found that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment in which he was staying temporarily with the owner\u0027s permission, not withstanding the fact that the apartment was not lawfully his. Essential to the Court\u0027s holding was the finding that the driver in this case was in lawful possession; indeed, the driver of a stolen vehicle lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in a car he may be driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion in which Neil Gorsuch joined, questioning the validity of the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" test. Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate concurring opinion encouraging the Court of Appeals to consider the question whether Byrd may assert a Fourth Amendment claim or to decide the appeal on another appropriate ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62939,"name":"Robert M.

Upon this report, the City of Hays chief of police ordered Vogt to issue a statement regarding the knife, which Vogt submitted nominally, in addition to a letter of resignation due to his intent to accept the position with the Haysville Police Department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hays police chief began an internal investigation into Vogt and required him to issue a more detailed statement regarding the knife. This subsequent statement led to additional evidence, and Hays Police Department submitted both to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, asking the Bureau to initiate a criminal investigation. As a result of the criminal investigation, the Haysville Police Department withdraw its offer of employment to Vogt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVogt was charged in state court with two felony counts related to his possession of the knife.

After some investigation, one of the officers located the house where the suspected driver of the motorcycle lived and observed what appeared to be the same motorcycle covered by a tarp in the driveway. The officer lifted the tarp and confirmed that it was the motorcycle (which was also stolen) that had eluded detainment on multiple occasions. The officer waited for the suspect to return home, at which point he went to the front door to inquire about the motorcycle. Initially the suspect denied knowing anything about it but eventually confessed that he had bought the motorcycle knowing that it had been stolen. The officer arrested the suspect for receipt of stolen property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, the defendant sought to suppress the motorcycle as evidence on the grounds that the police officer conducted an illegal warrantless search (by lifting the tarp covering the motorcycle parked in the driveway) that led to its discovery. The trial court held that the search was based on probable cause and justified under the exigent circumstances automobile exceptions to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement and convicted the defendant. The appeals court affirmed on the grounds of exigent circumstances, and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed as well, but under the automobile exception only. The Virginia Supreme Court reasoned that the automobile exception applies even when the vehicle is not “immediately mobile” and applies to vehicles parked on private property.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Fourth Amendment\u0027s automobile exception permit a police officer without a warrant to enter private property in order to search a vehicle parked a few feet from the house?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Fourth Amendment\u0027s automobile exception does not permit a police officer without a warrant to enter private property to search a vehicle parked a few feet from the house. In an 8–1 opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court held that its own Fourth Amendment jurisprudence regarding the home and the \"curtilage\" of one\u0027s home (the area immediately surrounding it) clearly prevents officers from entering and searching without a warrant, even if the object searched is an automobile. The Court found that the area searched (the back of the driveway) was indeed the curtilage of the defendant\u0027s home, and thus the Fourth Amendment\u0027s highest degree of protection applies there.

After President Obama nominated and the Senate confirmed Colonel Martin T. Mitchell as a judge of the Article I US Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR), Judge Mitchell continued to serve on the US Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA). A judge convicted Nicole Dalmazzi of wrongfully using ecstasy, a Schedule I controlled substance and sentenced her to dismissal and confinement for one month. The AFCCA affirmed the findings and sentence. Dalmazzi moved the CCA to vacate its judgment because of the participation of Judge Mitchell on the panel. Before the CCA ruled on her motion, Dalmazzi filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), so the CCA dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction. The CAAF rejected as moot Dalmazzi’s challenge to Judge Mitchell\u0027s continued service on the AFCCA, because his CMCR commission had not been signed until after the AFCCA decided her case on the merits. Both of the other consolidated cases involve similar facts, where Judge Mitchell was on the CCA panel that affirmed the convictions of the petitioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDoes the Court have jurisdiction to review two of the consolidated cases under 28 U.S.C. § 1259(3)?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes Judge Martin T.

The district court dismissed the claim, finding that the FLSA exempts service advisors from its overtime compensation provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, using the principle of Chevron deference to rely on a regulation promulgated by the Department of Labor in 2011 interpreting the statutory exemption as not encompassing service providers. The US Supreme Court vacated the panel’s decision, holding that the regulation lacked sufficient explanation and thus was not entitled to deference. On remand, the Ninth Circuit formulated its own interpretation of the applicable FLSA provision and concluded that the exemption does not encompass service advisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre service advisors at car dealerships exempt under 29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(10)(A) from the Fair Labor Standards Act\u0027s overtime-pay requirements?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 decision, the Court reversed and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, holding that because service advisors at car dealerships are “salesm[e]n . . . primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles,” 29 U.S.C. § 213(b)(10)(A), they are exempt from the FLSA\u0027s overtime-pay requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstruing the relevant portions of the statute, the Court explained that a service advisor is clearly a “salesman” who sells services to customers for their vehicles. The Court also concluded that service advisors are “primarily engaged in . . . servicing automobiles” since they are integral in the process of providing maintenance and repair services to customers, even if they do not spend most of their time physically repairing vehicles. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit’s use of the distributive canon, as well as its conclusion that FLSA exemptions should be construed narrowly in holding that service advisors were not exempt.  It also rejected the appellate court’s reliance on a 1966-67 DOL Occupational Outlook Handbook and the FLSA legislative history, both of which the Court found unpersuasive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

After Ethlyn passed away, one of her daughters, Elsa Hall, served as personal representative of the estate (the “Estate”) and continued to press Ethlyn’s claims against Samuel. Samuel brought claims of his own against Elsa in a separate proceeding. He argued that Elsa had poisoned his relationship with his mother, which caused him serious emotional distress. The Estate’s claims and Samuel’s claims were consolidated and tried together. A jury rejected the Estate’s claims and rendered a two million dollar verdict in Samuel’s favor. The District Court entered separate judgments on both aspects of the jury’s decision. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Estate appealed the judgment with respect to its claims, but did not appeal the judgment in favor of Samuel because the district court vacated the jury verdict and his claims were still awaiting retrial. Samuel argue that the appellate court does not have jurisdiction over this appeal while his claims were still pending in the district court, and the Third Circuit agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Third Circuit relied on its binding precedent in \u003cem\u003eBergman v. City of Atlantic City\u003c/em\u003e, which held that when two cases have been consolidated for all purposes, a final decision on one set of claims is generally not appealable while the second set remains pending. The Estate argues that the Supreme Court’s decision in \u003cem\u003eGelboim v. Bank of America Corp.\u003c/em\u003e affirming the appealability of final judgment in a case that was part of a multi-district litigation should dictate the outcome of the case and permit the exercise of jurisdiction over the claims that have a final judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould a Supreme Court decision regarding jurisdiction in multidistrict cases be extended to single district consolidated cases, such that the entry of a final judgment in only one case makes that case immediately appealable despite the existence of remaining pending claims in another related case?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court unanimously held that when one of multiple cases consolidated under FRCP 42(a) is finally decided, that ruling confers upon the losing party the right to immediate appeal regardless of whether any of the other consolidated cases are still pending. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the meaning of the term “consolidate” as used in Rule 42(a) was ambiguous, the Court examined its legal lineage and concluded that it extended back at least to the first federal consolidation statute, enacted in 1813. Pursuant to that history, the Court found it to be clear that an individual case consolidated under the Rule maintains its independent character, at least to the extent that it is appealable when it is finally resolved, whether or not proceedings are ongoing in the other consolidated cases. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court also explained that under the consolidation statute that was in place for 125 years before Rule 42(a) was enacted, consolidation was a case management tool rather than a means of completely merging the consolidated cases into one, meaning that prior to Rule 42(a), a final judgment in a single case was immediately appealable. Because Rule 42(a) was explicitly modeled on the consolidation statute, and the term “consolidate” used therein is ambiguous, the term presumably carries forward the same meaning it had under the old statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court rejected the argument that the term “consolidate” took on a new meaning under Rule 42(a), namely that it permitted consolidation for either limited or all purposes. It also explained that the Federal Rules Advisory Committee would not have silently changed the meaning of a term that had been in use pursuant to a long-term, settled understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the Court stated that it was not creating a rule that a district court could not consolidate a group of cases for all purposes, but it reiterated that in this context, cases retain their individual identities to the extent that final judgments in any specific case are immediately appealable.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62894,"name":"Andrew C.

Detroit Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e, upheld against a First Amendment challenge a Michigan law that allowed a public employer whose employees were represented by a union to require those of its employees who did not join the union nevertheless to pay fees to it because they benefited from the union’s collective bargaining agreement with the employer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIllinois has a law similar to that upheld in Michigan. The governor of Illinois brought a lawsuit challenging the law on the ground that the statute violates the First Amendment by compelling employees who disapprove of the union to contribute money to it. The district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the governor lacked standing to sue because he did not stand to suffer injury from the law, but two public employees intervened in the action to seek that Abood be overturned. Given that Abood is binding on lower courts, the district court dismissed the claim, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed dismissal for the same reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the Court’s decision in \u003cem\u003eAbood v. Detroit Board of Education\u003c/em\u003e be overturned so that public employees who do not belong to a union cannot be required to pay a fee to cover the union’s costs to negotiate a contract that applies to all public employees, including those who are not union members?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 vote, the Court reversed and remanded, holding that the State of Illinois’ extraction of agency fees from nonconsenting public-sector employees violated the First Amendment, meaning that \u003cem\u003eAbood v. Detroit Bd. of Education\u003c/em\u003e, which held otherwise, was overruled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Alito, the Court began by stating that the district court had jurisdiction over Janus’ suit, as he was undisputedly injured in fact by the state’s agency fee system, and the harm he suffered could be redressed if he prevailed in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving on to the merits, the Court concluded that the state’s collection of agency fees from nonconsenting public employees was a violation of the First Amendment, and that \u003cem\u003eAbood\u003c/em\u003e was incorrect in deciding otherwise. The Court stated that requiring individuals to endorse ideas they disagreed with runs counter to First Amendment principles, and that even under a more permissive standard than the “exacting” strict scrutiny that the Court had applied in evaluating the constitutionality of agency fees in the past, the Illinois scheme could not pass muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that neither of \u003cem\u003eAbood’s\u003c/em\u003e two justifications for agency fees, which were maintaining “labor peace” and eliminating the risk of “free riders,” could survive under this standard, finding that both problems could be mitigated through less restrictive means than agency fees. The Court also rejected newer state interests that had been asserted, which were to support bargaining with a sufficiently funded agent and increasing workforce efficiency, stating that unions could be effective without agency fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court further reasoned that \u003cem\u003estare decisis\u003c/em\u003e principles did not require deference to \u003cem\u003eAbood\u003c/em\u003e, finding that \u003cem\u003eAbood\u003c/em\u003e was poorly reasoned, lacked workability, and that over time it had become an “outlier” in the Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence. It also stated that \u003cem\u003eAbood’s\u003c/em\u003e uncertain status, along with the short-term nature of collective bargaining agreements and unions’ ability to protect themselves when agency-fee provisions were critical to their bargains all militated against giving \u003cem\u003eAbood\u003c/em\u003e decisive weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of these reasons, the Court concluded that the practice of states and public-sector unions collecting agency fees from nonconsenting employees was a violation of the First Amendment, and that no further agency fees or other forms of payment to a public-sector union could be collected, nor could attempts be made to collect such payments from employees without their consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Kagan filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Breyer. The dissent faulted the Majority for upsetting the balance that \u003cem\u003eAbood\u003c/em\u003e brought to public-sector labor relations, and for disregarding \u003cem\u003estare decisis\u003c/em\u003e principles for no special reason. It also criticized the Majority for issuing its decision without considering the consequences it could have in light of the fact that over 20 states had elaborate statutory schemes built on the Abood decision, thousands of contracts involving millions of employees relied upon those laws, and the government services that these public-sector employees performed impacted the lives of tens of millions of Americans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sotomayor filed an additional dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45468,"name":"William L.

On May 15, 2008, McCoy was found to be indigent and appointed a public defender. Throughout his representation by the public defender and his subsequent representation by retained counsel McCoy maintained his innocence and repeatedly stated his desire to plead not guilty. In December 2009, McCoy moved for his public defender to be removed due to his belief that the public defenders were doing nothing to assist him in proving his innocence. The court granted McCoy’s motion to represent himself until he could find substitute counsel. McCoy subsequently found new counsel to represent him, and his counsel advised him to take a plea. When McCoy refused to take a plea, his counsel notified him that he intended to concede guilt, after which time McCoy moved to discharge him. The court denied McCoy’s motion to discharge his attorney as untimely. His counsel proceeded to concede McCoy’s guilt and argued for verdicts of second-degree murder on a theory of diminished capacity. The jury returned a verdict of first-degree murder on all three counts and recommended the death penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Louisiana Supreme Court denied the appeal and affirmed the convictions and the sentence, reasoning that defense counsel’s failure to follow McCoy’s direction not to concede guilt did not deny Mr. McCoy the assistance of counsel or create a conflict of interest because it did not completely abdicate the defense. Rather, the decision to concede guilt was a strategic choice by counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes it violate a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel if defense counsel concedes the defendant’s guilt over the defendant’s express objection?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eInherent in the Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel is the autonomy right of a criminal defendant to choose the objective of his defense and insist that counsel not admit guilt, even if the counsel\u0027s experience-based view is that admitting guilt offers the best chance of avoiding the death penalty. In a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court distinguished decisions that may be made by counsel and those reserved to the client. Counsel may make decisions described as \"trial management\" such as whether to call a particular witness or raise certain objections to evidence. Reserved exclusively to the client are decisions including whether to plead guilty, waive the right to a jury trial, testify in one\u0027s own behalf, and forgo an appeal. Whether to assert innocence as a defense is also within those decisions reserved to the client. Because the issue presented in this case involves client autonomy, not effectiveness of counsel, the error is considered \"structural error\" and is not subject to harmless-error review. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined. In the dissent\u0027s view, the Court\u0027s holding arbitrarily distinguishes between counsel\u0027s conspicuously omitting discussion of one element of a crime and expressly conceding that element. The dissent further criticizes the majority for reaching an overly broad holding despite the unusual circumstances of the particular case before it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42213,"name":"Seth P.

His total criminal-history score was calculated according to the US Sentencing Guidelines Manual, but when calculating the criminal-history score, the probation officer erroneously counted a 2009 Texas conviction of misdemeanor assault twice. His total criminal-history score, combined with other factors, led a sentence of 78 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Rosales-Mireles did not object to the sentence after it was imposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fifth Circuit found that Rosales-Mireles met the three prongs necessary to meet the plain error standard. However, if all three prongs are met, the court has the discretion to remedy the plain error if the error “seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” The court declined to exercise its discretion in this case and therefore affirmed the judgment of sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Fifth Circuit apply the appropriate standard for plain error review when it required that the error be one that “would shock the conscience of the common man, serve as a powerful indictment against our system of justice, or seriously call into question the competence or integrity of the district judge”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed and remanded, holding that a miscalculation of a Federal Guidelines sentencing range that has been determined to be plain and to affect a defendant’s substantial rights calls for a court of appeals to exercise its discretion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) to vacate the defendant’s sentence in the ordinary case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 7-2 opinion authored by Justice Sotomayor, the Court explained that the Fifth Circuit’s narrow shock-the conscience standard was too restrictive in defining the extent of the appellate court’s jurisdiction in this context. The risk of unnecessary deprivation of liberty that can result from this narrow approach undermines the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings where a Guidelines error is plain, because it is ultimately the district court that is responsible for ensuring that it applies the correct Guidelines range. In addition, the Court stated that remands for resentencing are inexpensive compared to remands for retrial, and ensuring that Guidelines determinations are accurate furthers the Sentencing Commission’s goals of uniformity and proportionality in sentencing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Alito.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62899,"name":"Kristin L.

Much of the data associated with this service is saved on datacenters operated by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which are located throughout the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2013, Microsoft was served with a search and seizure warrant for the data pertaining to a particular user. That user\u0027s data was stored solely in Microsoft\u0027s datacenter in Dublin, Ireland. Microsoft disclosed all other responsive information requested in the warrant but moved the magistrate judge to quash the warrant with respect to the user data stored in Dublin. The magistrate judge denied Microsoft\u0027s motion to quash, finding that the Stored Communications Act (SCA) authorized the district court to issue a warrant for \"information that is stored on servers abroad.\" The magistrate judge held that the place where the government would review the content (the United States), not the place where the content was stored (Ireland) was the relevant place of seizure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft appealed the magistrate judge\u0027s decision, and the district court affirmed after reviewing de novo. The district court also held Microsoft in civil contempt for refusing to comply fully with the warrant. The Second Circuit held that the SCA does not authorize courts to issue and enforce against US-based service providers warrants for the seizure of customer email content that is stored exclusively on foreign servers and thus reversed the district court\u0027s denial of the motion to quash, vacated the finding of contempt, and remanded the case to the district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs an email provider who has been served with a warrant required, under 18 U.S.C. § 2703, to provide the federal government with emails, even when the email records are stored exclusively outside the United States?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWhile this case was pending, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, which amended the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701, et seq., to require email providers to disclose emails in its \"possession, custody, or control,\" even if the emails are stored outside the United States. The government then procured and served Microsoft with a new warrant pursuant to the amended law, and the parties agreed that the new warrant had replaced the original warrant at issue in this case. The Court explained that because there was no longer any live dispute between the parties, the case had become moot. The Court vacated the ruling on review and remanded the case to the Second Circuit with instructions to vacate the district court\u0027s contempt finding and its denial of Microsoft\u0027s motion to quash, and to direct the district court to dismiss the case as moot.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23018,"name":"E.

Much of the evidence against the Dahdas was obtained through wiretaps of cell phones used by the co-conspirators, including the Dahdas. The wiretaps arose out of nine orders issued by a federal district court in Kansas. Prior to trial, the Dahdas brothers moved to suppress the information obtained from the wiretaps on the grounds that the wiretap orders exceeded the district court\u0027s territorial jurisdiction. The trial court rejected that argument, and both were found guilty and sentenced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tenth Circuit upheld the decision allowing evidence from the cellphones to be used against the brothers. Although the court of appeals agreed that the wiretap orders exceeded the district court\u0027s territorial jurisdiction, it held that such defect did not \"directly and substantially affect a congressional intention to limit wiretapping. The court identified two “core concerns” of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968—privacy and uniformity—that were not implicated by the Dahdas’ argument that the order exceeded the Kansas district court’s jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 require suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a wiretap order that is facially deficient because it exceeds the judge’s territorial jurisdiction?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA unanimous Court, with the exception of Justice Gorsuch who took no part in the opinion, affirmed the 10th Circuit’s ruling, but with different reasoning than the appellate court had used. In an opinion authored by Justice Breyer, the Court explained that the 10th Circuit had incorrectly applied United States v. Giordano, 416 U. S. 505, 527 (1974) in deciding the case. Giordano and its “core concerns” test only applied to the first subsection of the statutory provision at issue, which dealt with “unlawfully intercepted” communications, where in this case, the second subsection, regarding facially insufficient wiretap orders, was the portion in dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court went on to hold that the wiretap orders authorized by the Kansas district court judge were not facially insufficient because they were not lacking any information that the wiretap statute required them to include, noting that “not every defect results in an insufficiency.” The Court also explained that the challenged language authorizing interception outside the court’s territorial jurisdiction was surplus, and thus did not render the orders facially insufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33978,"name":"Kannon K.

Thus, the cardholder and the merchant both depend on widespread acceptance of a card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the United States, credit-card transaction volume is comprised primarily of four networks: Visa (45%), American Express (26.4%), MasterCard (23.3%), and Discover (5.3%). Because of the way Visa and MasterCard transactions are handled, they do not directly set certain fees, but merely influence these prices. In contrast, American Express is directly involved in the vast majority of transactions involving its cards. Thus, it maintains direct relationships with both its cardholders and merchants and directly sets the relevant fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1980s, Visa and MasterCard adopted exclusionary rules preventing member institutions from issuing card products on the Amex or Discover networks, and ran ad campaigns highlighting Amex’s smaller network and higher merchant fees. In response, Amex strengthened contractual restraints designed to control how merchants treat Amex cardholders at the point of sale, known as non-discriminatory provisions (NDPs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2010, the federal government and 17 states sued Amex, Visa, and MasterCard for unreasonably restraining trade in violation of the Sherman Act. They alleged that the credit card companies used anti-steering provisions to suppress competition and block competition from rival networks. In 2011, Visa and MasterCard entered into consent judgments and voluntarily rescinded their anti-steering provisions. Amex proceeded to trial, and the district court ruled that Amex’s NDPs violated US antitrust laws. Reviewing the district court’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the lower court should have weighed the NDPs’ net effect on both merchants and cardholders under the generally accepted “rule of reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eUnder the “rule of reason,” was the government’s showing that American Express’s anti-steering provisions stifled price competition on the merchant side of the credit-card platform sufficient to prove anti-competitive effects, thereby shifting to American Express the burden of establishing pro-competitive benefits from the provisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eAmex\u0027s anti-steering provisions do not violate federal antitrust law. In a 5-4 opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court first looked to the definition of the market in this context, finding that it consists of both cardholders and merchants. The \"rule of reason\" establishes a burden-shifting process for showing antitrust violations, the first burden being on the plaintiffs to show anticompetitive effects. Defining the market as it did, the Court found that the government needed to prove not only that the anti-steering provisions had an anticompetitive effect on the merchants (which it did show), but also that they had an anticompetitive effect on the cardholders (which it did not). Having found that the government failed to meet its burden in the first step of the \"rule of reason\" test, the Court affirmed the decision of the Second Circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. In dissent, Justice Breyer criticized the majority for coming up with a market definition that has no basis in precedent and instead actually contradicts its holding in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/345/594/\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTimes-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, 345 U.S. 594 (1953)\u003c/a\u003e. Justice Breyer points to the finding by the district court of direct evidence of significant anticompetitive effects of the anti-steering provisions and would find that this evidence is sufficient to meet its burden under the \"rule of reason\" burden-shifting framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62682,"name":"Eric E.

Currier was indicted by a single grand jury and charged with burglary, grand larceny, and possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Before trial, the defense and prosecution agreed to sever the firearm charge from the grand larceny and burglary charges. The case proceeded to trial on the burglary and grand larceny charges, and a jury acquitted Currier of both charges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Commonwealth of Virginia sought to try Currier on the remaining charge of felon in possession of a firearm, he objected that collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) protections embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded his retrial. Notwithstanding his objections, Currier was tried, convicted, and sentenced. Currier filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict, and the trial court denied his motion. The Virginia Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court’s conviction, as did the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a defendant who consents to the severance of multiple charges into sequential trials lose his right under the Double Jeopardy Clause to the issue-preclusive effect of an acquittal?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court affirmed the Virginia Supreme Court’s ruling in a 5-4 vote, holding that because Currier consented to a severance of the multiple charges against him, his second trial and resulting conviction, following an acquittal at his first trial, did not violate the double jeopardy clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Gorsuch delivered the Court’s opinion with respect to Parts I and II, explaining that the double jeopardy clause bars a person from being tried more than once “for the same offence.” Currier argued that the Court’s precedent in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970) required a ruling in his favor. However, the Court stated that for a second trial to be precluded under Ashe, the Court must have been able to conclude that “it would have been irrational for the jury” in the initial trial to acquit without finding for the defendant on a fact essential to a conviction in the second trial. The Court then distinguished Ashe from the instant case by pointing out that even if Currier’s second trial could be classified as a retrial of the same offense under Ashe, he consented to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court went on to explain that the relevant precedent was Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137 (1977), in which the issue was a trial on a greater offense after an acquittal of a lesser-included offense. In Jeffers the Court held that if a single trial on multiple charges would be sufficient to avoid a double jeopardy violation, there could not be a violation where the defendant seeks two separate trials and persuades the trial court to grant the request. The Court stated that if consent could nullify a double jeopardy complaint in a situation involving a second trial for a greater offense, it could certainly overcome a double jeopardy complaint under Ashe. To hold otherwise would have been inconsistent with Jeffers and other Supreme Court precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Part III, Justice Gorsuch was joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito in concluding that civil issue preclusion principles could not be applied to criminal law through the double jeopardy clause to stop parties from retrying any issue or bringing in evidence regarding a previously tried issue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Kennedy filed a separate opinion concurring in part, finding that because Parts I and II resolved the case fully and properly, the scope of double jeopardy protections defined in Ashe did not need to be part of the Court’s analysis here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Ginsburg authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30283,"name":"Jeffrey L.

In the southwest corner of Georgia, the Chattahoochee joins the Flint River, to form the Apalachicola River, which flows south through northwest Florida and into the Apalachicola Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. At issue is the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin (ACF Basin), which the US Army Corps of Engineers reports drains a total of 19,800 square miles in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, which is distributed roughly into 74%, 15%, and 11%, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePursuant to congressional authorizations, the Corps operates a system of dams in the ACF Basin based on a Master Manual governing all the dams and a reservoir regulation manual for each individual dam. The Master Manual was completed in 1958 and has not been comprehensively revised since then. There have been several lawsuits among the states seeking update and clarify the apportionment of the waters of the ACF Basin. The present action was filed by Florida, which alleges that the ecosystem and economy of the Apalachicola region \"are suffering serious harm\" because of Georgia\u0027s consumption and storage of water from the Basin. Florida invokes the US Supreme Court\u0027s original jurisdiction to ask that the Court equitably apportion the waters of the ACF Basin. For equitable relief to be granted, Florida must first show standing—that is, that it has suffered a wrong through the action of another state that can be corrected by the courts. Second, the state must show by clear and convincing evidence a \"threatened invasion of rights . . . of serious magnitude.\" Third, the state must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the benefits of apportionment substantially outweigh the harm that could result. If a state meets this burden, the Court must craft an equitable-apportionment decree. After lengthy evidentiary hearings, the Special Master filed a report recommending that the Court deny Florida\u0027s request for relief on the ground that \"Florida has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that its injury can be redressed by an order equitably apportioning the waters of the Basin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Florida meet its burden of showing that its injuries could be redressed by a degree capping Georgia\u0027s upstream water consumption if the decree does not also bind the Corps?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eFlorida made a legally sufficient showing as to the possibility of fashioning an effective remedial decree equitably apportioning the waters of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin (ACF Basin). In a 5–4 opinion authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Court held that the Special Master applied too strict a standard (\"clear and convincing evidence\") when he determined that the Court could not fashion a appropriate relief. A complaining state should not have to prove with specificity the details of a workable decree; rather, it need only to show that it is possible to fashion such a decree, applying principles of \"flexibility\" and \"approximation.\" The Court reserved judgment as to the ultimate disposition of the case, finding only that Florida had made a legally sufficient showing of redressability. Further findings are needed to resolve many of the other evidentiary issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch joined. The dissent points out that the issue raised in this case is entirely about the balance-of-harms analysis and criticizes the majority for \"mush[ing] the requirements from our precedents together.\" In the dissent\u0027s view, the precedents are abundantly clear, and after a full trial, Florida failed to meet its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that \"the benefits of apportionment substantially outweigh the harm that could result.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25346,"name":"Gregory G.

The Rio Grande Compact apportions the water of the Rio Grande Basin among the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Among other things, the Compact provides that Colorado must deliver a specific quantity of water to the New Mexico state line, and that New Mexico must then deliver a specific quantity of water to Elephant Butte Reservoir, a federal Bureau of Reclamation project that distributes water to New Mexico and Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTexas alleges that New Mexico has depleted Texas\u0027s equitable apportionment of water under the Compact by allowing diversion of surface water and pumping of groundwater that is hydrologically connected to the Rio Grande below Elephant Butte. New Mexico contends that the Compact does not require it to deliver any specific amount of water to the Texas state line and thus that its actions do not violate the Compact.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay the United States properly intervene in an action involving a dispute over a compact between states?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the Court held that the United States is permitted to intervene in this particular dispute over a compact between states to defend \"distinctively federal interests\" that a normal litigant might not be permitted to pursue in traditional litigation. To reach this conclusion, the Court assessed four considerations. First, the compact at issue in this case is inextricably intertwined with certain other contracts that implicate federal interests (the Rio Grande Project and the Downstream Contracts). Second, the United States has a critical role in the operation of the compact at issue. Third, a breach of the compact could jeopardize the federal government’s ability to satisfy its treaty obligations to Mexico. Finally, the United States has asserted its compact claims in an existing action brought by Texas, seeking substantially the same relief and without that State’s objection. The Court specifically limited its holding so as not to answer the question whether the United States may initiate litigation to force a State to perform its obligations under the compact or expand the scope of an existing controversy between states.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":56070,"name":"Scott A.

EO-1 was immediately challenged in federal district court, and the judge entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit denied the government\u0027s emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal. Rather than continuing to litigate the matter, the government announced that it would revoke that order and issue a new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 6, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,780 (EO-2). Section 2(c) of EO-2 directs that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO-1 be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of the order, citing a need for time to establish adequate standards to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists. Section 6(a) directs that applications for refugee status and travel of refugees into the United States under the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) be suspended for 120 days from the effective date \"to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures.\" Section 6(b) suspends the entry of any individual under USRAP once 50,000 refugees have entered the United States in fiscal year 2017. The effective date of the order is March 16, 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe case before the Court represents two consolidated cases. In the first, federal district court in Maryland issued a nationwide preliminary injunction barring the government from enforcing Section 2(c) against any foreign national seeking entry to the United States. In the second, a federal district court in Hawaii issued a nationwide preliminary injunction barring enforcement of all of Section 2, as well as Section 6. The Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, largely upheld the the lower court\u0027s injunction as to Section 2(c), finding that one of the plaintiffs was likely to succeed on the merits of his Establishment Clause claim. The Ninth Circuit shortly thereafter largely upheld the Hawaii district court\u0027s injunction, finding that the key provisions of EO-2 likely exceeded the president\u0027s authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 14, just before Section 2(c) of EO-2 was by its terms set to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials declaring the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO–2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases “are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.\" The government sought review in both cases, making arguments both on the merits of the cases and on procedural issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion issued simultaneously with an order granting certiorari, the Court granted the government\u0027s applications for a stay of the preliminary injunction with respect to Sections 6(a) and (b) of Executive Order 13,780 (EO-2), thereby allowing enforcement of those provisions. Under the Court\u0027s ruling, the government may enforce Section 6(a) except as to any \"individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\" nor may such an individual be excluded under Section 6(b).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn September 24, 2017—the same day EO-2 was expiring—President Donald Trump has issued a new proclamation restricting travel to the United States by citizens from eight countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre respondents\u0027 challenges to the temporary suspension of entry of aliens abroad under Section 2(c) of Executive Order No. 13,780 justiciable?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes Section 2(c)\u0027s temporary suspension of entry violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs the global injunction, which was the relief granted based on alleged injury to an individual plaintiff, impermissibly overbroad?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eOn October 10, 2017, the Court vacated the lower court\u0027s judgment and remanded the case to the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit with instructions to dismiss as moot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court vacated the lower court\u0027s judgment in Trump v.

Cuero initially pleaded “not guilty” but subsequently changed to plead guilty to the two felony counts. Cuero admitted that he had previously served four separate prison terms, including a term for residential burglary, which counts toward California’s “three strikes” law. On his guilty-plea form, Cuero indicated that he understood that he “may receive this maximum punishment as as result of my plea: 14 years, 4 months in State Prison, $10,000 fine and 4 years parole.” After a hearing, the state trial court accepted the plea and granted the State’s motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charge. The court then scheduled a sentencing hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the sentencing hearing occurred, the prosecution determined that a second of Cuero’s prior convictions qualified as a “strike” and that the guilty-plea form erroneously listed only one strike. The fact that the present conviction would constitute his third “strike” under the law, Cuero faced instead a minimum sentence of 25 years. The State asked the trial court for permission to amend the criminal complaint accordingly, and over Cuero’s objection, the court granted the State’s motion. However, the court permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the change. Cuero withdrew his initial guilty plea and entered a new guilty plea to the amended complaint, which charged Cuero with one felony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trial court sentenced Cuero to 25 years to life, his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the California Supreme Court denied a state habeas petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuero then filed a petition for federal habeas relief in the US District Court for the Southern District of California, which denied his petition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state trial court had “acted contrary to clearly established Supreme Court law” by refusing to enforce the original plea agreement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs it “clearly established” federal law that a state court must impose a lower sentence that the parties originally agreed upon, rather allowing the state to amend its complaint to seek a higher sentence and the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea—such that a federal appeals court sitting in habeas proceedings can set aside the sentence of a state court for not applying that law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a per curiam opinion, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case. The Supreme Court has never held that specific performance was the appropriate remedy for the circumstances presented in this case. In \u003cem\u003eSantobello v. New York\u003c/em\u003e, the case the Ninth Circuit largely relies upon in finding “clearly established” federal law, the Court held that a defendant may not be bound to a plea agreement following a prosecutorial reach of an enforceable provision of such an agreement. However, “fairminded jurists could disagree” with the Ninth Circuit’s reading of that case. Thus, the Ninth Circuit erred when it held that “federal law” as interpreted by the Supreme Court “clearly” establishes that specific performance of the lower sentence that the parties had originally expected is constitutionally required.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"583","year":"2017","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27553"},"decisions":[{"description":"Supreme Court precedent does not \"clearly establish\" that specific performance of a previously agreed-upon lower sentence is the appropriate remedy in these circumstances.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15086,"name":"John G.

The law’s stated purpose is to ensure access to reproductive health services for all California women, regardless of income. NIFLA argued that the Act’s requirements that (1) licensed clinics provide information to patients about free and low-cost publicly funded family planning services, including contraception and abortion, and that (2) unlicensed clinics inform patients of their unlicensed status violated their free speech and free exercise rights under the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California denied NIFLA’s motion for preliminary injunction, concluding that they had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, as required under Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008), as to either their free speech or free exercise claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the district court had not abused its discretion by denying the injunction. The Court rejected NIFLA’s argument that strict scrutiny should apply to the Act, because while the law compelled content-based speech by requiring NIFLA to disseminate information about low-cost family planning services, it did not discriminate based on viewpoint. Relying on its own precedent in the face of a circuit split regarding the level of scrutiny to apply in the abortion-related disclosure context, the Court reasoned that the type of speech at issue in this case was professional speech. It was therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny, which the family planning information disclosure requirement survived. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court also affirmed that the requirement that unlicensed facilities disclose their unlicensed status survived any level of scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the Court agreed with the decision below that NIFLA was not entitled to a preliminary injunction on free exercise grounds, finding that the Act to be a facially neutral law of general applicability that survived rational basis review. The Supreme Court’s grant of certiorari did not include this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo disclosures required by a California reproductive rights law violate protections arising from the free speech clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the states through the 14th Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 vote, the Court reversed and remanded, holding that the pro-life pregnancy center petitioners were likely to succeed on their claim that the California Reproductive Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency Act (the “FACT Act” or the “Act”) violated the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Thomas, the Court began its discussion by explaining that the licensed notice was a content-based regulation that likely violated the First Amendment. The court rejected the Ninth Circuit’s characterization of the licensed notice as regulating professional speech, stating that the Court had never recognized “professional speech” as a separate category of speech that was subject to different free speech rules. The Court explained that it had only granted lesser protection to professional speech in two situations--where professionals were required to disclose “factual, noncontroversial information in their ‘commercial speech,’’’ and where states regulated professional conduct that incidentally implicated speech--and that neither of those lines of authority were applicable in the instant case. The Court further stated that it had a long history of protecting the First Amendment rights of professionals outside of those two contexts, emphasizing that imposing content-based regulations on professional speech created a risk of the government seeking to suppress unpopular ideas rather than advance legitimate regulatory objectives. The Court also concluded that the licensed notice did not survive even intermediate scrutiny, as it was “wildly underinclusive” in light of the Act’s stated purpose of providing low income women with information about the state-sponsored health services at issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court also held that the unlicensed notice unduly burdened protected speech. Assuming without deciding that rules requiring professionals to disclose “factual, noncontroversial information in their ‘commercial speech’” applied here, the Court stated that California was required to show that such disclosures were only justified if they addressed a potentially real and not simply hypothetical harm, and that here, the state had only presented hypothetical risks. And even if the state had overcome this requirement, the Court ruled that the unlicensed notice was still unduly burdensome because it “impose[d] a government-scripted, speaker-based disclosure requirement that [wa]s wholly disconnected from the State’s informational interest,” possibly leaving unburdened speakers whose messages aligned with the state’s views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Kennedy filed a concurring opinion, in which Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Alito and Gorsuch joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined. The dissent argued that both notice requirements were likely to pass constitutional scrutiny. Regarding the licensed notice, Breyer highlighted the Court’s precedent permitting state notice requirements as to abortion alternatives, such as adoption, and asked why a state law couldn’t require healthcare provider to provide information about abortion and childbirth services in this case. Breyer also rejected the majority’s assertion that the unlicensed notice was supported by only a “hypothetical” interest, as well as the conclusion that this particular requirement should be deemed facially unconstitutional due to the fact that it could create an undue burden in some situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35793,"name":"Michael P.

After the redevelopment plan was approved, Lozman filed suit against the City under the Florida Sunshine Law, seeking to invalidate the City’s approval of the plan due to insufficient public notice for the emergency meeting during which the plan had been approved. The city council met in a closed session to discuss the lawsuit, and the meeting transcript seemed to reflect councilmembers suggesting that the City should employ intimidation tactics in fighting Lozman’s claim. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 15, 2006, Lozman attended a regularly scheduled city council meeting and was granted permission to speak during the non-agenda public comment portion of the meeting. When it was his turn to speak, he attempted to begin discussing corruption in local government, and a councilmember instructed him to discontinue his comments on that topic. Lozman repeatedly ignored the councilmember’s instructions, and she ultimately instructed a City police officer to arrest Lozman. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLozman was charged with, inter alia, disturbing a lawful assembly. The prosecuting attorney concluded that there was probable cause for the arrest, but dismissed the charges on the grounds that successful prosecution was unlikely. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn February 2008, Lozman filed suit against the City under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on the grounds that the City had arrested him at the city council meeting in retaliation for his opposition to the redevelopment plan. He alleged (1) retaliation by false arrest under the First Amendment, (2) unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and (3) common law false arrest. The case went to trial in November 2014 with Lozman appearing pro se. The jury found in favor of the City on all claims. Lozman filed a motion for a new trial, which the district court denied. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn appeal, Lozman argued that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the jury’s finding of probable cause on the charge of disturbing a lawful assembly was against the great weight of the evidence. The Eleventh Circuit rejected this contention in light of the evidence presented at trial. It further explained that under its own precedent, a finding of probable cause bars a claim for false arrest under the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, and state law. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Eleventh Circuit also rejected Lozman’s challenge to the district court’s instruction on retaliatory animus, stating that any error the instruction may have contained was harmless because the jury’s probable cause finding defeated Lozman’s retaliatory arrest claim as a matter of law. The appeals court also rejected Lozman’s challenge to the lower court’s jury instructions regarding the City’s authority to limit public comment during city council meetings. The Supreme Court’s grant of certiorari did not include these two issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the establishment of probable cause defeat a claim of retaliatory-arrest under the First Amendment as a matter of law?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eRuling 8-1, the Court vacated and remanded, holding that the existence of probable cause for Lozman’s arrest for disrupting a city council meeting did not bar his First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim under the circumstances of this case. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Kennedy, the Court explained that its holding in this case was narrow. Lozman had conceded that probable cause for his arrest existed, but claimed that his arrest was in retaliation for his earlier protected speech, which took the form of an open-meetings lawsuit and public criticisms of city officials. However, the parties disagreed as to what standard should govern the allegations of retaliatory arrest. Lozman argued that the applicable precedent was Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), a civil case in which a teacher alleged retaliatory employment action in violation of his First Amendment rights, and the Court held that the employer could not be liable unless the alleged constitutional violation was a but-for cause of the employment termination. The City argued that Mt. Healthy should not provide the sole standard in this case, and that instead Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250 (2006), a criminal case which held that a plaintiff alleging retaliatory prosecution must show the absence of probable cause for the underlying criminal charge, should govern the case. But the Court responded that the question of what precedent applied to this issue need not be decided in a broad sense given that the facts of this case were so unusual in the retaliatory arrest context. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Lozman did not sue the officer who made the arrest, and likely could not have succeeded on a retaliatory arrest claim against him as the officer seemed to have acted in good faith, and there was no indication that he had any knowledge of Lozman’s prior lawsuit or criticisms of the local government. Instead, Lozman alleged that city officials had implemented an official policy of intimidation against him due to his lawsuit and public statements criticizing them, and that their premeditated plan culminated in his arrest at the city council meeting. Further, in order for the city to be subject to liability under § 1983, Lozman would need to prove that he suffered harm as a result of an “official municipal policy,” distinguishing his claim from most cases alleging retaliatory arrest, which often involve on-the-spot judgements by individual police officers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the uniqueness of this case in the retaliatory arrest context, along with the core First Amendment values at stake, the Court held that Lozman did not need to prove the absence of probable cause to maintain his retaliatory arrest claim. The Court also concluded that Mt. Healthy was the proper standard for assessing the retaliatory arrest claim on remand under these particular facts, but declined to address the requirements for proving such a claim in other contexts. The Court vacated the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38065,"name":"Pamela S.

The text of the statute did not define “political”, so Minnesota election officials distributed policy materials to help identify which items fell within the scope of the law. Election officials received instructions to request that anyone wearing apparel which violated the guidelines laid out in the policy materials remove or cover it up. While officials were instructed to allow the person to vote regardless of their compliance, misdemeanor prosecution was a possible outcome, should an individual refuse the removal or cover-up request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"m_5420848131695921677m_-5970511599820556662m_3188443106529117331gmail-p1\"\u003eThis case arose when Andrew Cilek, executive director for Minnesota Voters Alliance, was temporarily prevented from voting at his local polling place in November 2010 because he was wearing a t-shirt with a Tea Party logo and a button that advocated for the requirement of a photo ID to vote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"m_5420848131695921677m_-5970511599820556662m_3188443106529117331gmail-p1\"\u003eMinnesota Majority, Minnesota Voters Alliance, and Minnesota Northstar Tea Party Patriots, along with their association Election Integrity Watch (EIW), filed a lawsuit against the Minnesota Secretary of State and various county election officials to enjoin enforcement of the statute as unconstitutional. The parties claimed that the statute violated the First Amendment, facially and as-applied, and was selectively enforced, which also violated their Equal Protection rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"m_5420848131695921677m_-5970511599820556662m_3188443106529117331gmail-p1\"\u003eInitially, the district court dismissed all claims. The Eighth Circuit affirmed as to the claims regarding Equal Protection and facial First Amendment violations. It reversed and remanded the as-applied First Amendment claim. The district court ultimately granted summary judgment against EIW, \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e, on the as-applied First Amendment claim. Reviewing de novo the grant of summary judgment against EIW, the Eighth Circuit considered EIW\u0027s claim that the Minnesota statute was not reasonable, as applied to Tea Party apparel, because the Tea Party is not a political party in Minnesota. The Eighth Circuit was unpersuaded and held that the district court was correct in its ruling, since EIW had failed to present specific facts that showed banning Tea Party apparel was not reasonable, given the Minnesota statute\u0027s purpose. The Eighth Circuit held that EIW\u0027s argument that voters in Tea Party apparel were affected by selective enforcement had also failed, as it offered nothing more than speculation that voters wearing other forms of political apparel avoided enforcement of the statute. EIW, \u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e, then petitioned the Supreme Court to decide whether the lower courts’ ruling was correct. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"m_5420848131695921677m_-5970511599820556662m_3188443106529117331gmail-p1\"\u003eEIW indicates in their petition for a writ of certiorari that there is a circuit split on the issues presented, where the Eighth Circuit’s ruling aligns with the D.C. and Fifth Circuit, which both have held that the government has authority to ban forms of political speech near polling places. The Fourth and Seventh Circuits have held, by contrast, that a complete ban on all political speech, absent any limiting principle, is unconstitutional, regardless of the location in which such speech has been banned.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Minnesota Statute § 211B.II facially overbroad, thus infringing upon the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment by banning all political apparel at a polling place, effectively imposing a “speech-free zone”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Minnesota statute prohibiting individuals from wearing political apparel at a polling place violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In a 7-2 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court reasoned that a polling place is a nonpublic forum under its precedents, which means that the state may place reasonable limits on speech therein. Content-based restrictions on speech must be \"reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression\" based on the speaker\u0027s viewpoint. The text of the Minnesota statute made no distinction based on the speaker\u0027s political persuasion, so it would be permissible so long as it is \"reasonable.\" One component of reasonableness is the presence of \"objective, workable standards\" guiding enforcement of the law. Because the statute in question does not define the term \"political\" nor any other key terms describing the types of apparel subject to the prohibition, the law affords too much discretion in enforcing the ban and is thus unreasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Stephen Breyer joined. The dissent would not have reversed and remanded the court of appeals below, as the Court did, but instead would have certified the question to the Minnesota Supreme Court to give the state courts \"a reasonable opportunity to pass upon and construe the statute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62961,"name":"J.

The Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (the “Power District”) is the sole local supplier of traditional electricity, and is also a political subdivision of Arizona. The underlying action arose after Power District imposed a steep fee on consumers seeking to generate their own power, which SolarCity claims resulted in a 96% drop in retail applications for new solar panel systems. SolarCity sued the Power District for federal antitrust violations under the Sherman and Clayton Acts for allegedly attempting to exercise a monopoly over electrical power in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Power District moved to dismiss SolarCity’s claims under FRCP 12(b)(6), arguing that pursuant to the state-action doctrine it had the authority to dictate prices under state law, and was not subject to federal antitrust claims. The district court denied the motion, expressing doubts about the Power District’s state authority. The district court also declined to certify its order for interlocutory review, but the Power District still appealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit rejected the Power District’s appeal, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal of an order denying state-action immunity based on the collateral-order doctrine. The Court explained that unlike forms of government immunity that shield public entities from suit, and which carry a right to immediate appeal, the state-action doctrine only provides a defense against liability. Because a denial of state-action immunity could be the subject of a post-judgment appeal, it did not meet the requirements of the collateral-order doctrine upon which the Power District sought to base its interlocutory appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit joined the Fourth and Sixth Circuits in holding that a denial of state-action immunity was not immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine.

Sveen and Kaye L. Melin were married in 1997. Sveen purchased a life insurance policy that year, and the following year he named Melin the primary beneficiary, and his children the contingent beneficiaries. Sveen and Melin divorced in 2007, and Sveen died in 2011. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinnesota had changed its probate code in 2002 to apply a revocation-upon-divorce statute to life insurance beneficiary designations. Sveen had never changed the designation on his life insurance policy, and Melin was therefore still listed as the primary beneficiary at the time of his death. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe insurance company filed an interpleader to establish whether the revocation-upon-divorce statute nullified this designation. Sveen’s children and Melin cross-claimed for the proceeds, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the children, rejecting Melin’s contention that retroactively applying the revocation-upon-divorce statute violated the Contract Clause of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that under its own precedent, the dispositive issue in this context was the right of the policyholder to have his wishes carried out in accordance with his intentions at the time he signed the contract. Applying the revocation-upon-divorce statute retroactively would deprive him of that right in violation of the Contract Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the application of a revocation-upon-divorce statute to a contract signed before the law was enacted violate the Contract Clause of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn an 8-1 opinion authored by Justice Kagan, the Court reversed and remanded, holding that the retroactive application of Minnesota’s revocation-upon-divorce statute, which automatically nullifies an ex-spouse’s beneficiary designation on a life insurance policy or other will substitute, does not violate the contracts clause of the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that not all laws affecting pre-existing contracts violate the contracts clause. There is a two-step inquiry to determine whether such a law is in fact unconstitutional in this context. The first question is whether the state law “operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.” This inquiry involves three sub-issues, which are the extent to which the law 1) undermines the contractual bargain, 2) interferes with a party’s reasonable expectations, and 3) prevents the party from safeguarding or reinstating his rights. If those factors reflect a substantial impairment, the Court must then ask whether the law has been crafted in an “appropriate” and “reasonable” way to advance “a significant and legitimate public purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case the Court stopped its inquiry after considering only the first factor, finding that the Minnesota statute did not substantially impair pre-existing contractual arrangements. It found that first, the law in this case was intended to reflect the policyholder’s intent that he or she likely would not want their life insurance proceeds to pass to a former spouse, thus supporting rather than undermining the contractual scheme. Second, the law was not likely to thwart the policyholder’s expectations, as the policyholder could not reasonably expect a beneficiary designation to stay in place after a divorce. Third, the law in this case served as a mere default rule, which the policyholder could undo at any time by sending in a new beneficiary designation form. The Court stated that such a minimal paperwork burden does not violate the contracts clause under its well-established precedent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62644,"name":"Adam G.

The district court accepted the agreement and sentenced Hughes accordingly. Hughes then sought a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), which permits defendants who have been “sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.” The district court relied on Justice Sotomayor’s concurring opinion in Freeman v. United States, 564 U.S. 522 (2011) in determining that Hughes was ineligible for a sentence reduction because he was not sentenced “based on a sentencing range,” but on a plea agreement. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs an inmate who enters into a plea bargain under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) (which specifies that an attorney for the government will agree that a specific sentence is appropriate) eligible for a sentence reduction if the sentencing guidelines are changed subsequent to his sentencing?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that a sentence imposed pursuant to a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) (“Type C”) plea bargain is “based on” the defendant’s Federal Sentencing Guidelines range as long as that range was a component of the framework the court used in imposing the sentence or accepting the plea bargain, meaning that in this case, Erik Hughes could seek a sentencing reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that a central purpose of the Guidelines is uniformity in sentencing.  However, in the wake of the Court’s 4-1-4 decision in \u003cem\u003eFreeman v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, 564 U.S. 522 (2011), which considered the question of a defendant’s eligibility for a reduced sentence under § 3582(c)(2) after entering into a Type C agreement, some circuits followed the plurality opinion while others followed Justice Sotomayor’s concurrence, depending on how they applied \u003cem\u003eMarks v. United States\u003c/em\u003e, 430 U.S. 188 (1977).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn seeking to resolve this split in authority, the Court stated that a district court imposes a sentence that is “based on” the Guidelines range if the range was part of the basis the court used in exercising its discretion to impose a sentence. District courts are required to use the Guidelines range as a starting point for calculating sentences in every case, including cases involving Type C agreements. As such, in most cases, sentences imposed pursuant to Type C agreements are “based on” the defendant’s guidelines range. Therefore, when the Sentencing Commission lowers the range for a particular offense, unless there is a clear showing that the court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines range, a defendant who has entered into a Type C agreement related to that offense will generally be eligible for a reduction in sentence under § 3582(c)(2). The Court stated that this interpretation, as a systemic, structural matter, best supported the sentencing system Congress put into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePursuant to this reasoning and in light of the fact that the Guidelines range was a basis for Hughes’ sentence, the Court held that he was eligible for relief under § 3582(c)(2) given that the range had been lowered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court declined to decide the question of how \u003cem\u003eMarks\u003c/em\u003e should properly apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion in which she explained that she was joining the majority in full in the instant case in order to help resolve the confusion that had arisen in the aftermath of \u003cem\u003eFreeman\u003c/em\u003e, but stated that she still believed that her concurrence in \u003cem\u003eFreeman\u003c/em\u003e set forth the most convincing application of § 3582(c)(2)’s text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Roberts authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Alito and Thomas joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":23234,"name":"Eric A.

The Policy, which applied to most in-custody defendants appearing in such proceedings, was proposed by the U.S. Marshals Service and accepted by the District’s judges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magistrate judges in all four cases overruled the Defendants’ objections to the Policy. The Defendants appealed these denials to the district court, and also filed emergency motions challenging the Policy’s constitutionality. The district court denied all relief, and the four cases were consolidated before the 9th Circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 9th Circuit, sitting \u003cem\u003een banc\u003c/em\u003e, construed the Defendants’ appeals as petitions for writs of mandamus under its supervisory authority, and found that it had jurisdiction to review the Policy’s constitutionality. It explained that while the individual Defendants’ claims may be moot by the time of review due to their criminal cases ending and the Policy having been changed, under the Supreme Court’s precedent in \u003cem\u003eGerstein v. Pugh\u003c/em\u003e, the Defendants represented a broader group of similarly situated people who could be injured should the Policy be reinstated. Thus, applying the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review mootness exception, the supervisory mandamus case was not moot. However, because the Policy was no longer in effect, the court withheld a formal writ of mandamus.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the court of appeal err in considering respondents’ interlocutory challenge to the use of pretrial physical restraints, and in ruling on that challenge despite its recognition that respondents’ individual claims were moot?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA unanimous Court held that the case is moot. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court found that the appellate court\u0027s reliance on \u003cem\u003eGerstein\u003c/em\u003e was misplaced, as that case does not support a freestanding exception to mootness outside the class action context. Further, the mere presence of allegations that might, if resolved in respondents\u0027 favor, benefit other similarly situated individuals does not save their case from mootness. Additionally, the Court found unpersuasive the respondents\u0027 arguments that their claims fall within the exception to mootness by virtue of being \"capable of repetition yet evading review\" because the possibility that a person will be criminally prosecuted is insufficient to establish judicial standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":56065,"name":"Allon Kedem","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/allon_kedem","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kedem","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"allon_kedem"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22423"},{"advocate":{"ID":38890,"name":"Reuben C.

The space between a fence running across the width of the Tribe’s property and its southern border became a subject of dispute between the parties after the Tribe attempted to assert ownership of it in 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lundgrens’ property had been in their extended family since approximately 1947, during which time they had always treated the fence as the property line. In 2013 the Tribe purchased land to the north of the Lundgrens’ property, and were apparently not aware of the fence at that time. When they discovered it, they informed the Lundgrens of their intention to assert ownership rights over the disputed portion of land. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, the Lundgrens filed suit to quiet title to the property, seeking summary judgment on the basis that they had acquired the disputed property by adverse possession or mutual acquiescence and recognition long before the Tribe bought its parcel. The Tribe moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity, and because the Lundgrens could not join them as a necessary and indispensable party. The trial court denied the Tribe’s motion, and the Tribe sought direct discretionary review. In the resulting ruling, the court granted the Lundgrens’ motion for summary judgment, finding that they had established legal ownership of the disputed property through adverse possession and mutual recognition and acquiescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Washington Supreme Court accepted the Tribe’s amended motion for discretionary review of both prior orders, and affirmed. The court rejected the argument that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to the Tribe’s sovereign immunity, which neither the Tribe nor Congress had waived with regard to quiet title actions. The court found that because it had in rem jurisdiction, the Tribe’s sovereign immunity did not create a barrier to jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a court’s exercise of \u003cem\u003ein rem\u003c/em\u003e jurisdiction overcome an assertion of tribal sovereign immunity when the tribe has not waived immunity and Congress has not unequivocally abrogated it?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 7-2 opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the Court vacated the judgment below and remanded the case to the Washington Supreme Court to address the common-law question of sovereign immunity. The majority clarified that its decision in County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation addressed only a question of statutory interpretation, not the question presented here of whether Indian tribes have sovereign immunity in \u003cem\u003ein rem\u003c/em\u003e lawsuits. The respondents ask the Court to affirm on an alternative, common-law ground—that the tribe cannot assert sovereign immunity because the suit relates to immovable property located in Washington state and purchased by the tribe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice John Roberts filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Anthony Kennedy joined.

The company represented that it manufactured and sold organic compound fertilizers and other agricultural products to farmers in over two dozen provinces throughout China. It listed its shares on NASDAQ in 2005, and in 2009 reported to the SEC a net revenue of triple the amount it had reported four years earlier. In 2011, company shareholders alleged fraudulent business practices by China Agritech. The company denied the allegations and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation, and subsequently dismissed its independent auditor. Later that year, NASDAQ halted trading in and initiated delisting proceedings against China Agritech’s stock, and in 2012 the SEC revoked the stock’s registration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShareholders sued China Agritech in two successive putative class actions in 2011 and 2012, alleging various securities law violations against the company and several individual defendants. Class certification was denied in both cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShareholder Michael Resh brought a third putative class action against the company and individual defendants in 2014, alleging securities law violations arising from the same facts and circumstances as the first two cases. China Agritech moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that it had been filed after the two year limitations period applicable under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Resh and the additional plaintiffs argued that under the \u003cem\u003eAmerican Pipe \u0026amp; Construction v. Utah\u003c/em\u003e line of cases, the limitations period had been tolled on their claims during the pendency of the two prior class actions. The district court rejected this contention, finding that under \u003cem\u003eAmerican Pipe\u003c/em\u003e and its progeny, the limitations period was tolled as to individual class members, but that the Supreme Court had not decided whether an entirely new class action based on a substantially identical class was subject to the same rule. It ruled that the limitations period was therefore tolled as to the individual claims of the named plaintiffs in the instant case, but not as to the putative class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit reversed, with a three-judge panel finding that the plaintiffs’ class action would not be time-barred where: (1) the named plaintiffs had been unnamed in the two prior suits, which were against many of the same defendants and involved the same underlying events; (2) the two prior cases were timely; (3) class certification was denied in the earlier actions; and (4) pursuant to the \u003cem\u003eAmerican Pipe\u003c/em\u003e line of cases, the named plaintiffs’ individual claims were tolled during the pendency of the two prior class actions. The panel explained that permitting such claims to go forward was consistent with the policy goals of tolling in general. The panel further stated that in light of FRCP 23’s requirements, as well as principles of comity and preclusion, the existing legal system contains sufficient safeguards to prevent litigants from filing repetitious actions in light of this ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the \u003cem\u003eAmerican Pipe\u003c/em\u003e tolling rule allow a previously unnamed plaintiff to bring a subsequent class action after the applicable limitations period has passed?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Ginsburg, the Court reversed and remanded, holding that upon denial of class certification, a putative class member may not, in lieu of promptly joining an existing suit or promptly filing a individual action, commence a class action anew beyond the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that American Pipe and Crown, Cork \u0026amp; Seal Co. v. Parker addressed only putative class members wishing to file individual suits after a class certification denial. The Court reasoned that the “efficiency and economy of litigation” that support tolling of individual claims under American Pipe do not support the commencement of untimely successive class claims, stating that any additional class claims should be filed early in relation to the first lawsuit seeking class certification. The economy of litigation does however favor delaying individual claims until class certification has been denied. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court explained that this interpretation is supported by FRCP 23, as well as the securities litigation statute governing the case, which evince a preference for resolving class certification questions and grouping class filings at the outset of the litigation. The Court stated that there is little reason to allow plaintiffs who passed up opportunities to take part in pending class claims to become involved several years later. The Court further explained that plaintiffs who commence class actions after the expiration of the limitation period are not likely to qualify as diligent in asserting claims and seeking relief, which is typically a requirement for equitable tolling. Further, the Respondents’ proposed interpretation would allow the statute of limitations to be extended over and over again for a new lead plaintiff after each class certification denial, a result not envisioned by American Pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62968,"name":"Seth A.

Koons and four other defendants were convicted of methamphetamine conspiracy offenses. During the sentencing phase of each defendant’s trial, the government moved to reduce the defendant’s sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) for providing substantial assistance to the prosecution in the prosecution or investigation of another person. The district court in each case granted the government’s motion and reduced the defendant’s sentence to a term below the statutory mandatory minimum. All five defendants subsequently moved for further sentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), which allows a district court to reduce the sentence of “a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . . if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Eighth Circuit declined to follow the Fourth Circuit panel majority in holding that defendants are eligible for discretionary § 3582(c)(2) reductions. Rather, the Eighth Circuit interpreted the plain language of the statute to require the sentence be \u003cem\u003ebased on\u003c/em\u003e a range subsequently lowered by the Commission, and that in these five cases the sentence was based instead on the mandatory minimum and their substantial assistance. Accordingly, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of sentencing reductions, but for reasons different from those used by the district court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a defendant whose sentence is based on a mandatory minimum sentence statute and reduced due to providing substantial assistance to the government eligible for a further sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), when the Sentencing Commission retroactively lowers the advisory sentencing guidelines range that would have applied in the absence of the statutory mandatory minimum?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Alito, the Court held that the petitioners were not eligible for sentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) because their sentences were not “based on” their lowered Federal Sentencing Guidelines ranges, but rather were “based on” the mandatory minimum sentences for their offenses and their substantial assistance to the government. The Court explained that for a sentence to be “based on” a lowered Guidelines range, the range needed to have played at least a relevant part in a defendant’s sentencing.

NCEC developed sample maps using voter demographic data, a computer program, and a proprietary metric that predicts the likelihood of Democratic candidate success. In comparison to sample maps submitted by third parties, the NCEC-developed maps were assessed to be more likely to see Democratic candidate success. There is no evidence that the final map that was enacted to law was one of the ones developed by NCEC; rather, former Governor Martin O’Malley testified that the legislative director and staff from the Maryland Department of Planning likely created the final document. After the 2011 plan was implemented, the “Cook Partisan Voting Index” rated the Sixth District as a “likely” Democratic seat, whereas before the 2011 plan, the Sixth District was a “safe” Republican seat. In the 2012 congressional election, Democrat John Delaney defeated incumbent Republican congressman Roscoe Bartlett by a 20.9% margin. Subsequent elections saw other Democratic candidates succeeding over Republican candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction barring the State from enforcing the 2011 redistricting plan and requiring the State to implement a new map in advance of the 2018 midterm elections. A majority of the district court panel denied the motion and stayed the case pending the outcome of Gill v. Whitford, another gerrymandering case before the US Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid the majority err in holding that, to establish an actual, concrete injury in a First Amendment retaliation challenge to a partisan gerrymander, a plaintiff must prove that the gerrymander has dictated and will continue to dictate the outcome of every election held in the district under the gerrymandered map?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the majority err in holding that the \u003cem\u003eMt. Healthy\u003c/em\u003e burden-shifting framework is inapplicable to First Amendment retaliation challenges to partisan gerrymanders?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRegardless of the applicable legal standards, did the majority err in holding that the present record does not permit a finding that the 2011 gerrymander was a but-for cause of the Democratic victories in the district in 2012, 2014, or 2016? \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eWithout resolving the substantive questions, the Court held, in an unsigned per curiam opinion, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Republican voters\u0027 motion for a preliminary injunction. To succeed on a motion for preliminary injunction, the party seeking the injunction must show likelihood of success on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public\u0027s interest. Even assuming, contrary to the district court\u0027s findings, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, the Court found that they had unreasonably delayed seeking a preliminary injunction and that the public interest was not served in granting the injunction. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the motion for preliminary injunction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62609,"name":"Michael B.

A jury sentenced him to death, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence. Subsequently, an affidavit came to light in which a white juror from Tharpe’s trial, Barney Gattie, made several highly discriminatory statements regarding African Americans. Tharpe, who is black, sought habeas relief from the Butts County Superior Court, claiming that improper racial animus had influenced the jury’s deliberations. His petition was denied on the basis that he had procedurally defaulted by failing to raise the racial bias issue in earlier proceedings, and because he did not adequately support his claim that ineffective assistance of counsel was to blame for the omission. Juror testimony was also deemed inadmissible to prove Tharpe’s racial animus claim. He then applied for a certificate of probable cause to appeal from the Georgia Supreme Court, and his application was denied. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTharpe next petitioned the US District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254, alleging that racial bias among the jury had rendered his conviction and sentence unable to withstand constitutional scrutiny. The district court found this claim to be procedurally defaulted, but granted him a certificate of appeal (COA) on an ineffective assistance claim. The 11th Circuit then affirmed the district court’s judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the US Supreme Court’s 2017 decisions in \u003cem\u003ePena-Rodriguez v. Colorado\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBuck v. Davis\u003c/em\u003e, Tharpe petitioned the district court under FRCP 60(b)(6) to reopen his § 2254 case. He argued that \u003cem\u003ePena-Rodriguez\u003c/em\u003e should apply retroactively, allowing him to present the juror testimony that had previously been deemed inadmissible, and ultimately overcome procedural default to prevail on his claim that improper racial animus had led to his conviction and sentence. The district court denied Tharpe’s motion, concluding, \u003cem\u003einter alia\u003c/em\u003e, that his claim was procedurally defaulted, and that he had failed to produce any clear evidence that Gattie’s statements had influenced the jury’s conclusions. The 11th Circuit affirmed, declining to issue a COA and stating that Tharpe had failed to show that the district court’s correctness was debatable with regard to its procedural ruling.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould a capital case be reopened in light of a juror\u0027s racially discriminatory statements made after the petitioner\u0027s capital murder trial, providing sufficient evidence in the record for the trial court to conclude that racial animus had influenced the jury\u0027s conviction and imposition of the death sentence?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court issued a summary ruling granting the petition and remanding the case, explaining that while the state court’s factual determinations were binding on federal courts in the absence of clear and convincing countervailing evidence, Gattie’s affidavit provided compelling evidence that racial bias had influenced his vote to impose the death sentence. The Court concluded that the 11th Circuit had erred in ruling differently, and sent the case back to the lower courts to determine whether Tharpe was entitled to a COA.

The actions were consolidated and proceed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (“Texas District Court”). The plaintiffs alleged racial gerrymandering in violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) as well as the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution. At that time Texas was bound by the preclearance requirements under § 5 of the VRA, and therefore the State simultaneously filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (“D.C. District Court”) seeking preclearance of the redistricting plans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile trial proceedings were pending in both district courts, the 2012 primary elections were approaching. As a result, the Texas District Court assumed the task of implementing interim redistricting plans, which it did on an expedited basis, without access to all relevant facts, and with the understanding that most parties to the litigation alleged that those plans contained many of the same statutory and constitutional infirmities as the challenged plans. The U.S. Supreme Court vacated the first iteration of the interim maps on the grounds that the court had not been sufficiently deferential to the legislature; the Texas District Court issued more deferential plans in February 2012. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe D.C. District Court subsequently denied preclearance to the proposed redistricting plans on the basis that they were enacted with discriminatory intent and had the effect of abridging minority voting rights. Texas appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Texas District Court’s interim maps were used for the 2012 elections, the Texas legislature failed to take any action on redistricting in the 2013 regular session. However, it convened a special session during which it adopted, among others, the Texas District Court’s congressional interim map (“Plan C235”) without any changes. The governor subsequently signed the legislation adopting this plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court decided \u003cem\u003eShelby County v. Holder\u003c/em\u003e, which removed the § 5 preclearance requirements from the VRA. Texas was therefore no longer automatically subject to preclearance requirements, and the U.S. Supreme Court later vacated and remanded for further proceedings the D.C. District Court’s preclearance decision, which the lower court then dismissed as moot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe defendants subsequently sought to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims in the Texas District Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the case had become moot. In response, the plaintiffs expressed their desire to amend their complaints regarding the 2011 plans and to challenge the 2013 plans. The court granted them leave to amend, and denied the State’s motions to dismiss. The court explained that the plaintiffs’ claims regarding the 2011 plans were not moot because, \u003cem\u003einter alia\u003c/em\u003e, the plaintiffs continued to be harmed by them. The court also ordered that the 2013 plans, which included Plan C235, be used for the 2014 elections. The plaintiffs then filed their amended complaints, including claims related to both the 2011 and 2013 plans. Most plaintiffs included claims that Plan C235 violated § 2 of the VRA and the 14th and 15th Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Texas District Court held trials on the 2011 plans in 2014, and found that they violated certain aspects of § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. In the ongoing litigation, the plaintiffs contended that the 2013 plans, including Plan C235, included some of the same elements that the court determined were the result of discriminatory intent or statutory or constitutional violations as in the 2011 plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn August 2017, the Texas District Court issued an interlocutory order regarding the plaintiffs’ C235 claims. It found that the racially discriminatory intent and effects identified in the 2011 plans carried through to the 2013 plans where the redistricting lines remained the same. It explained that the legislature had adopted the court’s interim plans (which included C235) as part of a litigation strategy that was designed to insulate the plans from any further challenge. The legislature had not engaged in any deliberative process to remove the discriminatory elements from the plans before adopting them, but instead intentionally furthered and continued the discrimination in the existing plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe court also concluded that the configurations of CD 27 and CD 35 under Plan C235 violated § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. As to CD 27, though the court had found in 2012 that this district did not reflect a racially discriminatory purpose because it was not possible to create an additional Latino opportunity district in the region, the Texas legislature had still engaged in vote dilution. Regarding CD 35, the court stated that while C235 was enacted in 2013, the challenged district boundaries that it reflected were drawn in 2011 and found to violate § 2 of the VRA and the 14th Amendment. The court explained that the Texas legislature did not engage in any meaningful effort to cleanse the discriminatory elements from the 2013 plan before it was adopted, and in fact intended to maintain that discrimination in enacting the plan in substantially the same form. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe court additionally found that the plaintiffs had proven a § 2 “results” violation as to CD 27, HD 32, and HD 34, and a racial gerrymandering claim as to HD 90.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe court’s order directed the Texas Attorney General to issue a written advisory within three days as to whether the legislature would convene a special session to address the issue of redistricting. If the legislature did not plan to hold a special session, the parties were ordered to appear before the court to prepare remedial redistricting plans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the defendants’ appeal on the merits, at which time the Court would also consider the question of jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDid the district court issue an appealable interlocutory injunction when it invalidated Texas’ enacted redistricting plan and ordered the parties to appear at a remedial hearing to redraw state congressional districts unless the Governor convened a special legislative session to redraw the congressional map within three days?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the Texas legislature act with an unlawful purpose when it enacted a redistricting plan originally imposed by the district court to remedy any possible constitutional and statutory defects in a previous legislative plan that was repealed before it took effect?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the Texas legislature engage in intentional vote dilution when it adopted Congressional District (CD) 27 in 2013 after the district court’s 2012 finding that CD 27 did not support a plausible claim of racially discriminatory purpose and did not dilute Latino voting strength because it was impossible to create an additional Latino opportunity district in the region?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the legislature engage in racial gerrymandering in CD 35 when it simply adopted the district unchanged as part of the court-ordered remedial plan?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed and remanded in a 5-4 vote, holding that the Texas District Court erred in disregarding the presumption of good faith on the part of the Texas Legislature and improperly reversed the burden of proof in requiring the state to show a lack of discriminatory intent in adopting new districting plans; the Court also held that one of the state house districts at issue was an impermissible racial gerrymander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Alito, the Court began by explaining that it had jurisdiction to review the orders in this case under 28 U.S.C. § 1253, because they qualified as interlocutory injunction orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to the redistricting plans, the Court began its discussion by stating that in redistricting cases, legislatures are entitled to a presumption of good faith, and that the challengers had the burden of proof when alleging that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent. It also stated that a finding of past discrimination was not sufficient to undermine the good faith presumption. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that in this case, the 2011 plans were repealed and not enacted by the 2013 legislature, which instead enacted the Texas District Court’s interim plans with minimal changes, and without carrying forward the effects of the 2011 legislature’s discriminatory intent. The Texas District Court had violated the applicable burden of proof principles in referencing the need to “cure” the “taint” of the earlier legislature’s process, and faulting that legislature for its lack of deliberation on this issue. The Court further concluded that evidence of the 2011 legislature’s intent and the Texas District Court’s interim plans, when viewed with other evidence in the record, was insufficient to prove bad faith and intentional discrimination on the part of the 2013 legislature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter discussing its reversal of the Texas District Court’s intent finding, the Court addressed the four remaining districts that were invalidated on alternative grounds. It reversed the Texas District Court’s holding with regard to the three districts regarding which it relied on § 2’s “effects” test, but affirmed the holding that one district was an impermissible racial gerrymander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to the district findings it reversed, the Court explained that to support a § 2 “effects” claim, under \u003cem\u003eThornburg v. Gingles\u003c/em\u003e, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), a plaintiff must establish three factors: (1) a geographically compact minority population sufficient to constitute a majority in a single-member district, (2) political cohesion among the members of the minority group, and (3) bloc voting by the majority to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate. After making that showing, the plaintiff must then prove that the minority group’s votes are diluted by the district lines under the totality of the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding the Texas District Court’s finding that CD 27 violated § 2 by diluting the votes of Latino voters in Nueces County, who the district court ruled should have been included in a Latino opportunity district, the Court found that the plaintiffs were unable to show that an additional Latino opportunity district could be formed in that region of Texas. The Court also held that the Texas District Court erred in ruling that HD 32 and HD 34 did not comply with § 2, stating the the court’s findings showed that those two districts did not in fact violate § 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the Court affirmed the ruling that HD 90 was an impermissible racial gerrymander. That district was not derived from the Texas District Court’s interim plan, but was instead modified substantially by the 2013 legislature. The state argued that its use of race as a primary factor in shaping HD 90 was proper and even necessary to comply with § 2’s requirements, but the Court found that it failed to make the requisite showing of narrow tailoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Gorsuch joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, and was joined by Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, and Kagan. Sotomayor rejected the Majority’s assertion that the Court had jurisdiction to hear the case, disagreeing with its conclusion that the lower court’s orders constituted an injunction. She also disagreed with the Majority’s conclusion that the Texas District Court had erred with regard to the legal test for discriminatory intent. Sotomayor contended that the lower court had engaged in a careful consideration of the legislature’s intent rather than presuming invidious intent, and correctly found that the legislature intended to discriminate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":56070,"name":"Scott A.

On remand, the appellate court vacated the district court’s judgment for enhanced damages for willful infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 284, but reinstated its 2015 opinion in all other respects. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe underlying dispute in the case related to patent-practicing devices sold by ION Geophysical Corporation (“ION”) which were combined and used in non-infringing streamer systems at sea, but that would infringe on patents belonging to WesternGeco LLC (“WesternGeco”) if used in that manner in the US. The jury found infringement by ION, found no invalidity as to any asserted claims, and awarded WesternGeco, among other amounts, $93.4 million in lost profits. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a subsequent appeal to the Federal Circuit, ION asked, among other things, that the lost profits award be reversed. In its 2015 opinion, the Federal Circuit agreed and reversed that award on the grounds that under 35 U.S.C. § 271(f), WesternGeco was not entitled to lost profits arising from foreign uses of its patented invention. As stated above, the court then reinstated this portion of that opinion in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit err in holding that lost profits arising from prohibited combinations occurring outside of the US are categorically unavailable in cases in which patent infringement is proven under 35 U.S.C. § 271(f)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eRuling 7-2, the Court reversed and remanded, holding that WesternGeco’s award for lost profits was a permissible domestic application of § 284 of the Patent Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Thomas, the Court explained that there was a presumption against the extraterritorial application of federal statutes, but that a two-step framework applied when deciding extraterritoriality questions. The first step asks whether that presumption may be rebutted. If not, the second step inquires as to whether the the case implicates the domestic application of the statute. Factors relevant to the second determination include identifying the statute’s focus, and asking whether the conduct pertinent to that focus occurred domestically. If the answer is yes, then it is a permissible domestic application of the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court went on to state that though it is generally preferable to begin this inquiry with step one, courts have discretion to begin with step two, and the Court chose to do that in this case. In ascertaining the statute’s focus, the Court explained that the § 284 general damages provision was geared toward “infringement.” As such, in determining the focus of § 284 in a particular case, the type of infringement that occurred needed to be identified. In the instant case, WesternGeco’s infringement and lost profits claim was based on § 271(f)(2), the provision that regulates the domestic act of “suppl[ying] in or from the United States.” The Court explained that it had previously acknowledged that this section applied to domestic interests. The conduct in this case that was relevant to the statutory focus, and which consisted of exporting components from the U.S., took place in the U.S. As such, WesternGeco’s award was a permissible domestic application of § 284.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Breyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37772,"name":"Paul D.

Scott Appling hired the law firm of Lamar, Archer \u0026amp; Cofrin, LLP (“Lamar”) to represent him in legal proceedings against the former owners of his business. Appling incurred significant legal fees, and verbally told Lamar that he would be able to pay them after he received a sizeable tax refund that he was expecting. In reliance upon this statement, the firm continued to represent him through the conclusion of the litigation. Appling received a tax refund, though it was smaller than what he had told Lamar he was anticipating, and he put it into his business rather than paying the debt he owed to Lamar. Lamar obtained a judgment against Appling, and Appling subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Lamar initiated an adversary proceeding to collect the debt, and the bankruptcy court ruled that the amount was not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A) because Lamar had justifiably relied upon Appling’s fraudulent statements. The district court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 11th Circuit reversed and remanded. Noting a circuit split on how to construe the statute at issue, the court explained that because Appling’s fraudulent statements about his tax refund were not in writing and qualified as statements “respecting [his] . . . financial condition” under § 523(a)(2)(B), the debt could be discharged.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a statement regarding a specific asset be a “statement respecting the debtor’s . . . financial condition” under section 523(a)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, and if so, when?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court held that a statement regarding a specific asset can be a “statement respecting the debtor’s . . . financial condition” under section 523(a)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code. Interpreting the statutory provision at issue, the Court explained that the use of the word “respecting” in the legal context generally has a broadening effect. The Court also stated that the statute’s legislative history supported its reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch joined the opinion of the Court as to all but Part III-B.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":25346,"name":"Gregory G.

He admitted that for a period of two years, he and his co-conspirators misled General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) regarding the value of their assets in order to increase their revolving loan amount and secure under-collateralized funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing his guilty plea, Lagos appealed the district court’s order of restitution to the 5th Circuit. He argued that the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) did not allow restitution for the legal, expert, or consulting fees incurred by GECC in the course of investigating Lagos’ suspected fraud and the bankruptcy proceedings that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 5th Circuit affirmed the district court’s order  in light of its own precedent interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(b)(4) under the MVRA to permit restitution for investigative and legal costs, even under circumstances where these costs were incurred outside of the government’s investigation.

The Court also held that the fact that the victim shared the findings of its investigation with the government did not make the costs of the private investigation “necessary . . . other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation . . . of the offense” within the meaning of subsection (b)(4).\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62794,"name":"Daniel L.

Lucia and Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. (collectively “Petitioners”) for alleged anti-fraud violations of the Investment Advisers Act arising from the way they presented their retirement wealth management strategy to prospective clients. An administrative law judge (“ALJ”) found liability and imposed sanctions including a lifetime industry bar against Petitioners. The Commission granted the parties’ petitions for review, and found that Petitioners had committed anti-fraud violations and imposed the same sanctions as the ALJ. The Commission also rejected the argument that the administrative proceedings had been unconstitutional because the ALJ who handed down the initial decision was a constitutional Officer who had not been appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause under Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetitioners asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the Commission’s decision and order under review on the grounds that the ALJ who made the administrative ruling was a constitutional Officer who had not been appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause. The appeals court rejected this argument, explaining that Commission ALJs were not constitutional Officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, primarily because of their lack of authority to issue final decisions on behalf of the Commission pursuant to the agency’s regulatory scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre administrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission Officers of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 7-2 opinion, the Court reversed and remanded, holding that administrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission are “officers of the United States” subject to the Constitution’s Appointments Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an opinion authored by Justice Kagan, the Court began by stating that under its precedent, as established in \u003cem\u003eUnited States v. Germaine\u003c/em\u003e, 99 U.S. 508 (1879), and \u003cem\u003eBuckley v. Valeo\u003c/em\u003e, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), to be classified as an officer rather than an employee, a person needs to have a “continuing” position established by law, and must “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.” It went on to explain that the factors in \u003cem\u003eFreytag v. Commissioner\u003c/em\u003e, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), the case directly governing the instant matter, matched up almost exactly to the elements in Lucia’s case. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eFreytag\u003c/em\u003e, the Court ruled that U.S. Tax Court “special trial judges” (STJs) were officers because they met the elements required under \u003cem\u003eGermaine\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBuckley\u003c/em\u003e, and because they had significant discretion in addition to considerable responsibilities in presiding over administrative proceedings. These responsibilities included “tak[ing] testimony, conduct[ing] trials, rul[ing] on the admissibility of evidence, and hav[ing] the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders.” The Court reasoned that the SEC’s ALJs, like the STJs in \u003cem\u003eFreytag\u003c/em\u003e, held a continuing office established by law, and exercised the same degree of discretion when carrying out the same functions as the STJs. But in contrast with the Tax Court STJs, whose decisions were always required to be reviewed by a regular Tax Court judge, the SEC ALJs’ decisions were not always subject to review; if the SEC decided against review then the ALJ’s decision would become final and be “deemed the action of the Commission.” As such, the SEC ALJs were officers of the United States subject to the Appointments Clause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of this conclusion, because Lucia had made a timely challenge in his case to the constitutional validity of the ALJ’s appointment, he was entitled to a new hearing before a properly appointed official.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Gorsuch joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Breyer filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, and was joined by Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor as to Part III.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ginsburg joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":33557,"name":"Jeffrey B.

This so-called “fishing clause” guaranteed the Tribes “the right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations . . . in common with all citizens of the Territory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince those treaties, there have been recurring and ongoing disputes between the Tribes and (originally) the white settlers there and (today) the state government itself. The present case arises from the Tribes’ contention that the government was building and maintaining culverts (channels carrying water under roads or sidewalks) that diminished the size of salmon runs in traditional fishing areas for the Tribes. The 20+ Tribes represented in the suit allege that this diminishment amounts to violation of the fishing clause of the treaties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWashington contends that it constructed the culverts in a particular way according to federal law and that the federal requirement caused it to violate the treaties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court found for the Tribes and issued an injunction ordering Washington to correct its offending culverts. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDoes the “right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations ... in common with all citizens” under a treaty guarantee “that the number of fish would always be sufficient to provide a ‘moderate living’ to the tribes”?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid the district court err in dismissing the state\u0027s defense that the federal government’s instructions for designing the culverts violated the treaties to which the state was a signatory?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes the district court’s injunction violate principles of federalism and comity by requiring the state to replace hundreds of culverts, at a cost of several billion dollars, when the plaintiff Tribes have not showed a clear connection between culvert replacement and the supply of tribal fisheries?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, an equally divided Court affirmed the lower court\u0027s decision.

Pereira overstayed his visa, and in May 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personally served him with a notice to appear for a removal hearing. The notice did not specify the date and time of his initial removal hearing, but instead ordered him to appear before an immigration judge “on a date to be set at a time to be set.” When the immigration court set a date and time, it mailed Pereira a notice with such information. However, the notice was sent to Pereira’s street address on Martha’s Vineyard rather than his post office box, so Pereira never received it. When Pereira did not appear for his removal hearing, an immigration judge ordered him removed in absentia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePereira was not removed and instead remained in the country. In March 2013, he was arrested for a motor vehicle violation and detained by DHS. Through his attorney, Pereira filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings, claiming he had never received the hearing notice with the time and place. Although Pereira conceded that he could be removed, he sought relief in the form of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), a provision that gives the attorney general discretion to cancel the removal of a non-permanent resident alien if the alien meets certain criteria, including ten years of continuous physical presence in the United States. This continuous period ends “when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a)” of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Pereira contends that because he did not receive notice of the time and place of his removal hearing, his presence in the country was continuous and over ten years under the statute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has held that a notice to appear that does not contain the date and time of the hearing is nonetheless effective to end the period of continuous physical presence. However, Pereira challenges this reading of the statute. The First Circuit determined that the relevant provisions of the INA are ambiguous as to whether notice must include the date and time of the hearing to be effective, but the court found that the BIA’s interpretation of the statute was reasonable and thus subject to \u003cem\u003eChevron\u003c/em\u003e deference.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust a notice to appear for a removal hearing specify the place and time of the hearing to effectively trigger the stop-time rule of 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), contrary to the holding of the Board of Immigration Appeals?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA notice to appear for a removal hearing that does not specify the time and place of the hearing does not trigger the stop-time rule. In an 8-1 decision authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court reasoned that a \"notice to appear\" that does not include with specificity both \"when\" and \"where\" cannot reasonably be expected to result in a person appearing at their hearing. The Court looked to the text of the statute, which provides that the continuous period in question ends \"when the alien is served with notice to appear,\" and \"notice to appear\" is defined throughout the section as \"a written notice . . . specifying . . . \"the time and place at which the proceedings will be held.\" The text of the statute is thus unambiguous, so \u003cem\u003eChevron\u003c/em\u003e deference to the interpretation by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is unnecessary. This requirement of a \"notice to appear\" is also consistent with congressional intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion to note his concern over the way courts apply \u003cem\u003eChevron\u003c/em\u003e deference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which he finds that the language of the statute is ambiguous and thus that the BIA\u0027s interpretation is entitled to \u003cem\u003eChevron\u003c/em\u003e deference.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62978,"name":"David J.

Consistent with this doctrine, the US Supreme Court held, in 1967, that a state cannot require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence within that state to collect and remit taxes for goods sold or shipped into the state. The Court affirmed this holding in 1992. In 2015, the Court heard another case with similar facts and while it declined to change its jurisprudence, Justice Kennedy wrote a separate concurrence questioning whether the Court should continue following the earlier cases in light of additional dormant Commerce Clause cases as well as the significant technological and social changes that affect interstate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an apparent appeal to the doubt expressed by Justice Kennedy in that concurring opinion, the South Dakota Legislature passed a law requiring sellers of “tangible personal property” in that state who do not have a physical presence in the state to remit sales tax according to the same procedures as sellers who do have a physical presence. The act limited the obligation to sellers with gross revenue from sales in South Dakota of over $100,000, or 200 or more separate transactions, within one year. The legislature passed the law in defiance of Supreme Court jurisprudence, citing its inability to maintain state revenue in the face of increasing internet sales and their effect on sales tax collections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe State commenced a declaratory judgment action in state court seeking a declaration that certain internet sellers subject to the law must comply with it. The sellers moved for summary judgment based on the binding Supreme Court cases. The court granted the motion for summary judgment and enjoined the State from enforcing the law. The State appealed to the state supreme court, and likewise bound by Supreme Court precedent, that court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eShould the Court abrogate its holding in \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-194\"\u003eQuill Corp. v. North Dakota\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e that the dormant Commerce Clause prohibits states from requiring sellers with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax for goods sold within the state?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe physical-presence rule of\u003cem\u003e Quill Corp. v. North Dakota\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNational Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Illinois\u003c/em\u003e is unsound and incorrect, so both of those cases are overruled. In a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court held that sellers who engage in a significant quantity of business within a state may be required to collect and remit taxes, despite not having a physical presence in the state. First, the Court reasoned that the physical presence rule of \u003cem\u003eQuill\u003c/em\u003e is not a necessary interpretation of the requirement that a state tax must be \"applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state.\" Physical presence is an outdated proxy for \"substantial nexus,\" and the Court\u0027s due process doctrine provides other methods of establishing whether a seller has a substantial nexus to the state. Then, it found the rule in \u003cem\u003eQuill\u003c/em\u003e creates, rather than resolves, market distortions. It puts businesses with physical presence at a competitive disadvantage relative to remote sellers. Finally, the Court explained by example how the rule in \u003cem\u003eQuill\u003c/em\u003e as imposes \"the sort of arbitrary, formalistic distinction that the Court\u0027s modern Commerce Clause precedents disavow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion clarifying that he \"should have joined\" Justice White\u0027s dissenting opinion in \u003cem\u003eQuill\u003c/em\u003e and to criticize the Court\u0027s \"entire negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Neil Gorsuch filed a concurring opinion to criticize the dormant Commerce Clause, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined. The dissent would find that \"the internet\u0027s prevalence and power have changed the dynamics of the national economy\" is a rationale not for discarding the physical-presence rule, but for upholding it. In the dissent\u0027s view, \"any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt such a critical segment of the economy should be undertaken by Congress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62972,"name":"Marty J.

Under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. § 3231(e)(1), any form of “money remuneration” paid to railway employees is subject to an excise tax “equal to a specified percentage of its employees’ wages….” (Railroad retirement tax rates are much higher than social security tax rates.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen employees exercise their stock options when the market price exceeds the price at which the employee has a right to buy the stock, the employee can benefit from a windfall. The Internal Revenue Service argues that this windfall is taxable, just as employees’ wages are taxable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court found for the government, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The appeals court reasoned that while the government’s argument that “anything that has a market value is a form of money remuneration” was too broad, it was still correct in its assertion that stock is equivalent to cash. Moreover, as a policy concern, the government’s position avoids creating a tax incentive that could distort the ways in which employers structure compensation packages.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the stock that a railroad company transfers to its employees taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. § 3231(e)(1)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed and remanded, holding that employee stock options are not taxable “compensation” under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act because they are not “money remuneration.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 opinion authored by Justice Gorsuch, the Court explained that as a matter of textual interpretation, stock options did not fall within the definition of “money” as it was understood at the time the Act was adopted. Stock options could be bought or sold for money, but did not constitute a medium of exchange themselves. And while adding the term “remuneration” indicated that Congress wanted to tax monetary compensation, which could take many forms, it did not indicate that it wanted to tax things that were not money at all, like stock. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court also stated that the broader statutory context of the time supported its reading. A provision of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code treated “money” and “stock” as two different things, and a companion statute to the Act taxed “all remuneration” instead of just “money remuneration,” reflecting a difference in meaning between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IRS itself also issued a regulation in 1938, explaining that the Act taxes “all remuneration in money, or in something which may be used in lieu of money,” which included things like salaries, commissions, and bonuses. But the regulation did not suggest that stock was taxable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Breyer authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42633,"name":"Thomas H.

At the time of his sentencing, the Sentencing Guidelines range was 135–168 months. The government recommended the minimum 135-month sentence, and the sentencing court accepted that recommendation. In 2014, the Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the relevant offense levels. Chavez-Meza subsequently sought and was granted a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). He requested that the court reduce his sentence to 108 months, the new minimum, but the court reduced his sentence to 114 months. In issuing the new sentence, the court issued a standard form stating it had “tak[en] into account the policy statement set forth at USSG § 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).” Chavez-Meza appealed the reduced sentence, claiming that the district court did not adequately explain how it applied the § 3553(a) factors in deciding on the 114-month sentence. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a circuit split as to whether a district court must explain how it applies the § 3553(a) factors. The Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that the district court must provide some explanation for its decision when the reasons are not otherwise apparent from the record. The Fourth, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits have held that the form language is sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMust a district court provide some explanation for its decision not to grant a proportional sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), as the 6th, 8th, 9th, and 11th Circuits have held, or is boilerplate language stating the court took into account the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors sufficient, as the 4th, 5th, and 10th Circuits have held?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court affirmed, holding that because the record in this case as a whole demonstrated that the judge had a reasoned basis for his decision, the judge’s explanation for reducing Chavez-Meza’s sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) to the middle instead of the bottom of the amended Federal Guidelines range was adequate. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-3 opinion authored by Justice Breyer, the Court stated that even if a judge reducing a prisoner’s sentence were subject to the same requirements as the original sentencing judge, the district court’s explanation was appropriate in this case. The Court pointed out that the judge making the sentence modification, who was in fact the same judge who imposed the original sentence, had access to all of the factors considered at the original sentencing. He also certified that he had considered the relevant factors under § 3553(a), and then lowered Chavez-Meza’s sentence to a point somewhat higher than the bottom of the new sentencing range. The Court found this unsurprising in light of the judge’s conclusion that the original sentence of 135 months was sufficiently high. The Court stated that there may be cases in which a disproportionate sentence reduction may require a more detailed explanation. But here, given the simplicity of the case, as well as the judge’s familiarity with the case history and the relevant sentencing factors, his explanation fell within the scope of discretion available to him under the law as a sentencing judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Kennedy authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Sotomayor and Kagan joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62980,"name":"Todd A.

EO-1 was immediately challenged in federal district court, and the judge entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its provisions. A panel of the Ninth Circuit denied the government\u0027s emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal. Rather than continuing to litigate the matter, the government announced that it would revoke that order and issue a new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 6, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,780 (EO-2). Section 2(c) of EO-2 directed that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO-1 be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of the order, citing a need for time to establish adequate standards to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists. Section 6(a) directed that applications for refugee status and travel of refugees into the United States under the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) be suspended for 120 days from the effective date \"to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures.\" Section 6(b) suspended the entry of any individual under USRAP once 50,000 refugees have entered the United States in fiscal year 2017. The effective date of the order was March 16, 2017. EO-2 was subject to swift litigation as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 14, just before Section 2(c) of EO-2 was by its terms set to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials declaring the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO–2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases “are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.\" The government sought review in both cases, making arguments both on the merits of the cases and on procedural issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion issued simultaneously with an order granting certiorari, the Court granted the government\u0027s applications for a stay of the preliminary injunction with respect to Sections 6(a) and (b) of Executive Order 13,780 (EO-2), thereby allowing enforcement of those provisions. Under the Court\u0027s ruling, the government may enforce Section 6(a) except as to any \"individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\" nor may such an individual be excluded under Section 6(b).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn September 24, 2017—the same day EO-2 was expiring—President Donald Trump issued a Proclamation restricting travel to the United States by citizens from eight countries. That Proclamation too was challenged in federal court as attempting to exercise power that neither Congress nor the Constitution vested in the president. The Ninth Circuit struck down the Proclamation, and the Supreme Court granted review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre the plaintiffs’ claims challenging the president’s authority to issue the Proclamation reviewable (“justiciable”) in federal court? \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes the president have the statutory authority to issue the Proclamation?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs the global injunction barring enforcement of parts of the Proclamation impermissibly overbroad?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes the Proclamation violate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court assumed without deciding that the plaintiffs\u0027 claims are justiciable and held that the Proclamation does not violate the president\u0027s statutory authority or the Establishment Clause. The Court did not resolve the question whether the district court\u0027s global injunction is impermissibly overbroad. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion for the 5–4 majority. The majority first considered Hawaii\u0027s argument that the September 2017 order exceeds the president’s authority under federal immigration laws. Under Section 1182(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the president has \"broad discretion\" to suspend the entry of non-citizens into the United States. The Proclamation was the result of a “worldwide, multi-agency review” that determined that entry by certain non-citizens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Thus, the Proclamation does not exceed any statutory power of the president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor does the Proclamation violate another statute, Section 1152(a)(1)(A), which bars discrimination based on nationality in the issuance of visas. While that section prohibits discrimination, it does not limit the president\u0027s authority to block the entry of nationals of some countries, just as several other presidents have done before President Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the majority considered the plaintiffs\u0027 Establishment Clause claim. On its face, the majority found the Proclamation did not favor or disfavor any particular religion. But even looking behind the face of the Proclamation, the majority found that the facts that many majority-Muslim countries were not subject to restrictions and that some non-majority-Muslim countries were subject to the restrictions supported the government\u0027s contention that the Proclamation was not based on anti-Muslim animus and was instead based on \"a sufficient national security justification.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Anthony Kennedy joined the majority and authored a separate concurring opinion emphasizing that any subsequent proceedings must afford deference to the executive, as the majority opinion states, and also urging government officials to act and speak in accordance with the Constitution even when their actions and speech are not subject to judicial review or intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas also joined the majority and authored a separate concurring opinion largely to express concern over the trend of federal district courts to issue \"global\" or \"nationwide\" injunctions and to call upon the Court to address that trend, which Justice Thomas believes oversteps the authority of those courts absent legislation granting them such authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Kagan joined, in which he questioned whether the government is actually applying the exemption and waiver programs as it purports to do, citing evidence that it may not be doing so. In light of this evidence, Justice Breyer would remand the case  to the district court and would keep the order on hold until that issue is resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. Justice Sotomayor criticized the majority for \"ignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent, and turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering the Proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens.\" Focusing on the plaintiffs\u0027 Establishment Clause claims, Justice Sotomayor opined that the Court incorrectly chose to apply the rational basis standard of scrutiny, despite prior cases indicating a higher level of scrutiny was required in such cases, and she would find that even under the rational basis test, the Proclamation should fail because in the president\u0027s own terms it was originally and continues to be \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37093,"name":"Noel J.

Other benefits, including life insurance, ceased upon retirement. The agreement also contained a clause stating that it would terminate in May 2004. When it did expire in 2004, a class of CNH retirees and surviving spouses filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that their health care benefits vested for life and asking the district court to enjoin CNH from changing them. While that lawsuit was pending, the US Supreme Court issued a decision in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/13-1010\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eM\u0026amp;G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, holding that collective-bargaining agreements must be interpreted according to ordinary principles of contract law. The Court’s holding in \u003cem\u003eTackett\u003c/em\u003e specifically targeted the Sixth Circuit, in which there was precedent for courts to presume that collective-bargaining agreements vested retiree benefits for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the intervening ruling by the US Supreme Court in \u003cem\u003eTackett\u003c/em\u003e, the district court initially awarded summary judgment in favor of CNH, but then it awarded summary judgment to the retirees. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the court’s award of summary judgment to the retirees, using the same precedents the Court proscribed in \u003cem\u003eTackett\u003c/em\u003e to find the collective-bargaining agreement ambiguous as a matter of law and thus susceptible to interpretation based on extrinsic evidence about lifetime vesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Sixth Circuit err in using a series of inferences to conclude that a collective-bargaining agreement was ambiguous as a matter of law, thus allowing courts to consult extrinsic evidence about whether retiree benefits were vested for life?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the Court reversed the Court of Appeals and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Sixth Circuit’s use of inferences to interpret the collective-bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the Court’s holding in \u003cem\u003eTackett\u003c/em\u003e. Under \u003cem\u003eTackett\u003c/em\u003e, the collective-bargaining agreement must be interpreted using ordinary principles of contract law. Under its clear terms, the agreement unambiguously terminated the benefit of health care to retirees in 2004, rather than vesting them for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"583","year":"2018","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27580"},"decisions":[{"description":"Under Tackett, collective-bargaining agreements must be interpreted according to ordinary principles of contract law.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15094,"name":"Elena Kagan","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/elena_kagan","view_count":0,"last_name":"Kagan","roles":[{"id":2738,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":1281157200,"date_end":0,"appointing_president":"Barack Obama","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2738"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32690,"mime":"image/png","size":44456,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/elena_kagan/elena_kagan.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":4259,"identifier":"elena_kagan"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"none","seniority":8,"ideology":-1.605,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/209446"},{"member":{"ID":15131,"name":"Sonia Sotomayor","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sonia_sotomayor","view_count":0,"last_name":"Sotomayor","roles":[{"id":2776,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":1249707600,"date_end":0,"appointing_president":"Barack Obama","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2776"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32685,"mime":"image/png","size":50379,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/sonia_sotomayor/sonia_sotomayor.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":4710,"identifier":"sonia_sotomayor"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"none","seniority":7,"ideology":-3.222,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/209447"},{"member":{"ID":15084,"name":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/ruth_bader_ginsburg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Ginsburg","roles":[{"id":2728,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":744958800,"date_end":1600405200,"appointing_president":"Bill Clinton","role_title":"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States","institution_name":"Supreme Court of the United States","href":"https://api.oyez.org/preson_role/scotus_justice/2728"}],"thumbnail":{"id":32681,"mime":"image/png","size":45030,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/sites/default/files/images/people/ruth_bader_ginsburg/ruth_bader_ginsburg.thumb.png"},"length_of_service":9901,"identifier":"ruth_bader_ginsburg"},"vote":"majority","opinion_type":"none","seniority":4,"ideology":-2.734,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/decision_vote/decision_vote/209448"},{"member":{"ID":15113,"name":"Anthony M.

When they arrived, they saw Amy Hughes holding a large kitchen knife in what appeared to be a confrontation with another woman later identified as Sharon Chadwick. Despite at least two commands to drop the knife, Hughes did not do so and instead took several steps toward Chadwick. Kisela fired four shots through the chain link fence, seriously injuring Hughes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHughes sued Kisela under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging that Kisela had used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment to Kisela, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes (as is required in a motion for summary judgment), was sufficient to demonstrate that Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment. Further, the Ninth Circuit next held that Kisela was not entitled to qualified immunity because, in its view, his actions violated clearly established law in that jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Kisela\u0027s shooting of Hughes violate clearly established law, thus depriving him of qualified immunity?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eKisela\u0027s actions did not violate clearly established law, so he is entitled to qualified immunity.

In the absence of a decision in that circuit or by the Supreme Court clearly defining the right the officer violated such that he would have understood that he was violating it, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity for his actions. The Court did not consider whether his actions constituted excessive force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined.

(“Petitioners”) are US vitamin C purchasers who commenced a multidistrict class action lawsuit against Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., et al. (“Respondents”), which are business entities incorporated under the laws of China, alleging violations of U.S. antitrust laws. Specifically, they claimed that Respondents engaged in price-fixing and supply manipulation in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Respondents did not deny that they had coordinated prices and sought to create a supply shortage, but moved to dismiss on the grounds that they acted in accordance with Chinese government regulations requiring them to do so. The district court denied Respondents’ motion to dismiss and a subsequent motion for summary judgment. Following a jury trial, the court entered a judgment of approximately $147 million against Respondents, and enjoined them from engaging in any further anti-competitive activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRespondents appealed to the 2nd Circuit, which vacated the judgment, reversed the district court’s denial of the motion to dismiss, and remanded the case with instructions for the lower court to dismiss Petitioners’ complaint with prejudice. The appellate court based its reversal on international comity grounds, explaining that the district court had erred in not deferring appropriately to the Chinese government’s explanation of its domestic laws, which mandated the conduct by Respondents that was considered anti-competitive under US law. Particularly given that the Chinese government had appeared in the proceedings, the fact that Respondents could not simultaneously comply with US and Chinese laws necessitated the conclusion that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction in this case. The appeals court further held that other factors significant under an international comity balancing test derived from 3rd and 9th Circuit case law affirmed that abstention was appropriate in the instant matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eMay a court exercise independent review of an appearing foreign country’s explanation of its own law (as held by the US Courts of Appeals for the 5th, 6th, 7th, 11th, and DC Circuits), or must a court defer to a foreign government’s legal statement, based on principles of international comity, if that foreign government appears before the court (as held by the opinion below in accord with the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit)?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a unanimous decision, Court reversed and remanded, holding that a federal court determining foreign law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 should accord respectful consideration to a foreign government’s submission, but the court is not bound to accord conclusive effect to the foreign government’s statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting for the Court, Justice Ginsburg explained that under Rule 44.1, a court’s determination of foreign law “must be treated as ruling on a question of law.” Further, in evaluating the foreign law question at issue, a court may consider any relevant material, and is not limited to materials submitted by the parties. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court further stated that neither Rule 44.1 nor other sources speak to the weight that a court must give to a foreign government’s submissions, and while in the spirit of international comity a court should “carefully consider” a foreign state’s views regarding the meaning of its own laws, the ultimate import of those views will vary based on a number of factors. While no specific formula will apply in all cases, key considerations include: the statement’s “clarity, thoroughness, and support”; “its context and purpose”; “the transparency of the foreign legal system”; “the role and authority of the entity or official offering the statement”; and “the statement’s consistency with the foreign government’s past positions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court concluded that when viewed in the context of these considerations, the 2nd Circuit’s ruling was inconsistent with both Rule 44.1 and the Court’s treatment of analogous state government submissions. Further, in focusing on the Chinese government’s statements, the appellate court overlooked evidence in the record submitted by the U.S. purchasers. The Court additionally stated that the ruling below was inconsistent with international practice. The case was sent back to the lower courts for further consideration consistent with the Court’s opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":56123,"name":"Brian H.

After President Obama nominated and the Senate confirmed Colonel Martin T. Mitchell as a judge of the Article I US Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR), Judge Mitchell continued to serve on the US Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA judge convicted Keanu Ortiz of possessing and distributing child pornography, and sentenced him to two years\u0027 imprisonment and a dishonorable discharge. A panel of the AFCCA, which included Judge Mitchell, affirmed the findings and sentence. Ortiz filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), asking the court to consider whether Judge Mitchell was disqualified from serving on the CCA because he had been appointed to the CMCR. Ortiz claimed that Judge Mitchell\u0027s CMCR appointment precluded him from serving on the CCA under both the the federal statute and the Constitution. The CAAF rejected both of Ortiz\u0027s arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote\u003c/strong\u003e: This case was original consolidated under \u003ca href\u003d\"/cases/2017/16-961\"\u003eDalmazzi v.

Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the Court found that the CAAF\u0027s not being an Article III court does not remove the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review its decisions. The Supreme Court uncontroversially reviews the decisions of many non-Article III courts, including state courts and those of the District of Columbia. Nor does the fact that CAAF is part of the Executive Branch remove the Supreme Court\u0027s jurisdiction over it. Because it is a permanent court of record established by Congress, the Supreme Court may properly exercise jurisdiction over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, as to Judge Mitchell\u0027s simultaneous service on CMCR and AFCCA, the Court found that the express authorization to assign military officers to the CMCR under §950f(b)(2) was both necessary and sufficient to exempt him from §973(b)(2)(A). Once the Secretary of Defense placed Judge Mitchell on the CMCR, the president\u0027s subsequent appointment of him to AFCCA did not negate the secretary\u0027s earlier action but ratified it. With respect to the constitutional claim, the Court held that it has never interpreted the Appointments Clause to impose rules about dual service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion. He joined the majority\u0027s opinion in full but wrote separately to say that the conclusion reached by the Court is consistent with the founders\u0027 understanding of judicial power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. The dissent would find the Court lacks jurisdiction over decisions by the CAAF because the Supreme Court\u0027s appellate jurisdiction permits it to review only the lawful exercise of judicial power. Because the CAAF is a military tribunal and part of the Executive Branch, the dissent argues the Court lacks jurisdiction to review its decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62842,"name":"Stephen I.

Two witnesses to the shooting recognized or were able to describe Beaudreaux but did not know his name. Seventeen months later, one of the witnesses was arrested for an unrelated crime, and while in custody, was shown a middle-school yearbook with Beaudreaux\u0027s photograph. The witness identified Beaudreaux as the shooter in the Drummond murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficers interviewed the second witness the following day, and the witness identified Beaudreaux as the shooter from a photo array that included Beaudreaux and five other men. Later, the witness was shown a different photo array that used a different photograph of Beaudreaux, and again the witness identified Beaudreaux as the shooter. At a preliminary hearing, the witness positively identified Beaudreaux after seeing him in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeaudreaux was tried in 2009 for first-degree murder and attempted second-degree robbery. Both witnesses testified and identified Beaudreaux as the shooter, and the trial court sentenced him to a term of 50 years to life. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, and his first state habeas petition was denied. He filed a second state habeas petition claiming, among other things, that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the second witness’s identification testimony. The California Court of Appeal summarily denied the petition, and the California Supreme Court denied review. Beaudreaux filed a federal habeas petition, which the district court denied. A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was not reliable enough to overcome the suggestiveness of the procedures and that counsel’s failure to move to suppress the identification prejudiced Beaudreaux’s case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Ninth Circuit err in not considering reasonable grounds for the state court’s summary decision and in essentially reviewing the state court’s findings de novo, rather than applying a deferential standard?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit erred by not considering the arguments that could have supported the state court’s summary decision and by failing to assess Boudreaux’s ineffectiveness claim with the appropriate amount of deference to the state court.

In her complaint she alleges that two police officers visited her apartment in response to a noise complaint, entered her apartment without consent, and “then proceeded to engage in a course of strange and abusive conduct.” She further alleges that at one point she “knelt and began to pray but one of the officers ordered her to stop.” Sause claims that the officers’ conduct violated her First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion and her Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The defendants moved to dismiss Sause’s claim for failure to state a claim, asserting that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, Sause—now with counsel—argued only that her free exercise rights were violated by the officers’ conduct (dropping her Fourth Amendment claims). The Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the action, concluding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the failure of the self-represented plaintiff in this case to raise her Fourth Amendment claim on appeal after bringing closely related First and Fourth Amendment claims in the original action render unnecessary the court’s resolution of her Fourth Amendment claims?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a per curiam opinion, the Court held that Sause’s failure to raise her Fourth Amendment claims on appeal did not render unnecessary the lower court’s resolution of the “inextricabl[y]” linked First and Fourth Amendment claims. The district court should have interpreted the pro se complaint “liberally,” and in doing so it should find that the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment claims cannot properly be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Although the plaintiff raised only her First Amendment claim on appeal, even that claim “demanded consideration of the ground on which the officers were present in the apartment and the nature of any legitimate law enforcement interests that might have justified an order to stop praying at the specific time in question.” Without such consideration, a finding of qualified immunity for the officers would be premature.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"585","year":"2018","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/27617"},"decisions":[{"description":"The Tenth Circuit erred by holding that the police officer defendants were entitled to qualified immunity before considering petitioner\u0027s Fourth Amendment claims.","votes":[{"member":{"ID":15086,"name":"John G.
