Both were eligible for citizenship, but had refused to apply. Both had applied for certification as public school teachers in New York State. New York law prohibited the certification of non-citizen teachers who had not sought citizenship. Both applications were denied certification solely on that ground. Norwick filed suit in federal district court, which Dachinger later joined. The three-judge district court ruled in their favor, arguing that the statute as \"overbroad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the New York statute violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 opinion, the Court reversed the District Court and held that states could be justified in barring aliens from certain positions in government. Justice Lewis F. Powell\u0027s majority opinion asserted the state\u0027s interest in charging teachers with \"an obligation to promote civic virtues and understanding in their classes, regardless of the subject taught.\" The statute furthered this interest, in that it affected only non-citizens who did not want to seek citizenship. This interest satisfied the \"rational relationship\" required by _Foley v. Connelie\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30409,"name":"Judith A.

At 12:45 p.m., they observed Zackary C. Brown and another man leaving an alley in opposite directions. The alley was in an area known for a high incidence of drug traffic. The officers believed the situation was suspicious and stopped Brown for questioning. They asked Brown to identify himself, and he refused and asserted that they had no cause to stop him. When the officers frisked him, they did not find any drugs or other suspicious material on Brown. He was arrested for violation of a Texas statute that made it illegal for a person to refuse to identify himself when a police officer lawfully requests it. Brown was taken to the county jail, where he did identify himself, and was charged with the violation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown was convicted in municipal court and fined. He then exercised his right to a trial in the county court and moved for dismissal on the grounds that the Texas statue was unconstitutional under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The motion was denied and he was convicted. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWhen the police detain someone because that person refused to identify himself, does it constitute a seizure subject to the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment covers all police seizures, even those as brief as preventing a person from walking away. The Fourth Amendment requires that such seizures be based on specific and objective facts that create a compelling public interest in the seizure that outweighs the individual’s expectation of privacy. In this case, the Court held that the police officers lacked any reasonable suspicion based on objective fact to allow them to detain Brown and question him. Since the seizure was not lawful, the Texas statute requiring Brown to identify himself did not apply. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39022,"name":"Raymond C.

While in Vietnam, he accused superior officers of covering up atrocities that American troops had committed. The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) produced and broadcast a documentary of the petitioner\u0027s story. Herbert sued for libel arguing that the program falsely and maliciously portrayed his character, causing him financial loss. In order to prove libel under the \"actual malice\" standard, Herbert\u0027s attorneys deposed Lando as well as the producer and the editor of the documentary, attempting to deduce the editorial decisions that were made during the production of the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn an accusation of libel, do the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect members of the press from inquiries into their thoughts, opinions, and conclusions that go into the editorial process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals and held that the privilege not to answer editorial inquiries is not absolute. Justice White argued that shielding editorial decision-making from inquiry would \"substantially enhance the burden of proving actual malice,\" a burden which was already substantial in the Court\u0027s view. White was confident that investigations into this process for falsehood or libelous reporting would not lead to self-censorship of stories that are documented and true; \"only reckless error will be discouraged,\" which would not threaten the constitutionally protected freedom of the press.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31588,"name":"Jonathan W.

After viewing the videos, he took them to the Town Justice, who determined that the films violated state obscenity laws. The Justice issued a warrant authorizing a search of the store and seizure of other copies of the two films. Because the investigator said that more obscene materials would be found and asked the Justice to accompany him to the search, the Justice included in the warrant, “the following items which the Court independently has determined to be possessed in violation” and left it open ended so any items found at the store could be added later. During the search, the store’s clerk was arrested. The Justice viewed several videos, books, and other materials and determined that they were obscene. The police seized all of these materials, took and inventory of the items and then filled out the open ended warrant. Before trial, the store owner moved to suppress the seized evidence as violating the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The judge denied the motion and the store owner plead guilty. The Supreme Court of the State of New York affirmed the conviction. The Court of Appeals of New York denied leave to appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the search of the adult bookstore with an open-ended warrant violate the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes as to the Fourth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion of a unanimous court, reversing and remanding. The Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment did not permit a search with an open-ended warrant that left the determination of what was obscene fully in the discretion of the officials conducting the search. The Court also held that the search was not justified under the theory that the store owner had no legitimate expectation of privacy because the items were displayed at a store open to the general public. Merely inviting the public to enter does not give consent to wholesale searches and seizures that do not conform to the Fourth Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":17433,"name":"Bernard A.

Tracing the development of the Court\u0027s considerations of this issue, Justice Rehnquist indicated that Burch\u0027s case sat at the \"intersection of our decisions concerning jury size and unanimity.\" Rehnquist relied on the Court\u0027s holding in Ballew v. Georgia (1978) and the practices in several of the states to find against convictions by nonunanimous juries of six members. Only two of the states that used six-member juries in trials for petty offenses allowed verdicts to be less than unanimous. This \"near uniform judgment of the Nation\" of the inappropriateness of this jury arrangement, argued Rehnquist, provided the Court with a \"useful guide\" in determining constitutionally allowable jury practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34722,"name":"Louise Korns","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/louise_korns","view_count":0,"last_name":"Korns","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"louise_korns"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11077"},{"advocate":{"ID":32323,"name":"Jack Peebles","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_peebles","view_count":0,"last_name":"Peebles","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_peebles"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the petitioners","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11078"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15698,"title":"Oral Argument - February 22, 1979","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15698"}],"citation":{"volume":"441","page":"130","year":"1979","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/15825"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15043,"name":"Potter Stewart","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/potter_stewart","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stewart","roles":[{"id":2687,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-353962800,"date_end":362984400,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

A state court later dismissed the DUI charges, but the Massachusetts Registrar of Motor Vehicles suspended Montrym’s driver’s license for ninety days because Montrym had refused to take a breathalyzer test at the time of his arrest. Montrym filed a class-action lawsuit in federal district court alleging that the statute that required drivers to submit to breathalyzer tests violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it did not provide for a pre-suspension hearing. The district court found in favor of Montrym and ordered the Registrar to return the plaintiffs’ licenses. The Registrar appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment permit a state agency to suspend a driver’s license based only on his refusal to take a breathalyzer test?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the lower court erred in finding that the Massachusetts statute deprived Montrym of his Fourteenth Amendment right to Due Process. In the Court’s view, Massachusetts’ interest in highway safety and administrative efficiency outweighed Montrym’s interest in his driver’s license. Furthermore, the possibility for a prompt, post-suspension hearing before the Registrar minimized the risk of erroneous deprivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent in which he characterized the statute as inducing drivers to submit to a breath analysis test, which in turn provided the police with credible evidence of drunk driving. He argued that the interest in preventing drunk driving did not trump an individual’s right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard prior to the suspension of his driver’s license. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36747,"name":"Mitchell J.

Upon arriving, the suspect retrieved his suitcase and left in a taxi. The police officers pursued and stopped the taxi, and ordered the driver to open the trunk which revealed the suitcase in question. The police opened the suitcase without obtaining permission from its owner and found nearly ten pounds of marijuana.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the warrantless search of the suitcase by the police violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments which prohibit unreasonable searches?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment\u0027s warrant requirement applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile. In this case, Justice Powell applied the principle which the Court had identified in United States v. Chadwick (1977), namely, that a locked footlocker which had been loaded into a vehicle could not be opened without a warrant. Since the Little Rock police officers had exclusive control of the luggage at the time of their search, there was no danger that its contents could have been tampered with or removed before a valid warrant could have been obtained. Powell concluded that since \"luggage is a common repository of one\u0027s personal effects\" it is \"associated with the expectation of privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32419,"name":"Joseph H.

The police forcibly entered Payton\u0027s home thinking he was there (he was not) and found evidence connecting Payton to the crime, which was introduced at Payton\u0027s trial. The police lacked an arrest warrant when they entered his home. However, they acted under a New York law allowing police to enter a private residence to make a felony arrest without a warrant. At trial, Payton unsuccessfully sought to suppress the evidence as the fruit of an illegal search. State courts upheld. In the companion case, victims identified Obie Riddick in June 1973 for robberies in 1971. Police learned of his whereabouts in 1974. Without a warrant, they knocked on his door, entered his residence and arrested him. A search for weapons revealed illegal drugs. He was indicted on narcotics charges but sought the suppression of the evidence based on a warrantless entry. The trial judge concluded that the entry was authorized by the New York law and that the search was therefore permissible. Riddick was convicted. The appeals court affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes New York statute authorizing warrantless arrests and searches violate the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the 6 to 3 majority, held that the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, \"prohibits the police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect\u0027s home in order to make a routine felony arrest.\" Warrantless arrests and searches went to the core of the Fourth Amendment\u0027s protection of privacy in a citizen\u0027s dwelling. This protection was too important to be violated on the basis of a police officer\u0027s on-the-spot decision regarding probable cause. In the absence of special circumstances, a search of a residence is permissible only after a finding of probable cause by a neutral magistrate issuing a search warrant. Justice Byron R. White, joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist, dissented. White maintained that common law and practice prior to and at the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted did not limit a police officer\u0027s inherent power to arrest or search.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":44962,"name":"William E.

Moreno\u003c/i\u003e, in which Juan Carlos Moreno and other nonimmigrant aliens residing in Maryland sued the University of Maryland for failing to grant them in-state status for the purpose of tuition. They alleged violations of various federal laws and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court found in favor of Moreno and the Court of Appeals affirmed. In \u003ci\u003eElkins v. Moreno\u003c/i\u003e, the Supreme Court held that, since the University of Maryland policy is based on showing proof of domicile in the state, the University has no reason to deny in-state tuition if the proper proof can be shown. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn June 23, 1978, two months after the decision in Elkins, the University of Maryland adopted a resolution affirming their denial of the in-state tuition rate. The Attorney General of Maryland then requested that the Supreme Court put the case back on the docket for further argument given the new resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan the Court reconsider this case under the same Fourteenth Amendment criteria as the previous case, \u003ci\u003eElkins v.

In the previous case, the issue was linked to whether the nonimmigrant aliens could be domiciled in the state. In view of the new resolution, the domicile issue is no longer paramount. The Court held that there were new issues that must be considered by a district court before the case makes its way to the Supreme Court docket. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":20851,"name":"David H.

Green and Moore were tried separately, and each was convicted and sentenced to death. At Green\u0027s trial, the defense introduced the testimony of Thomas Pasby, who had testified at Moore\u0027s trial. According to Pasby, Moore admitted to him that he had killed Allen alone. The trial court refused to allow Pasby\u0027s testimony, considering it to be hearsay under Georgia law. On appeal, Green argued the refusal to allow Pasby\u0027s testimony constituted a violation of his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Supreme Court of Georgia denied his claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid refusing to allow Pasby\u0027s testimony under Georgia\u0027s hearsay law violate Green\u0027s right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a per curiam opinion, the Court concluded that Pasby\u0027s testimony was \"highly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial\" and \"substantial reasons existed to assume its reliability.\" Primarily, the Court noted that Georgia had permitted Pasby\u0027s testimony at Moore\u0027s trial. Thus, the state had already deemed the testimony reliable and valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n","citation":{"volume":"442","page":"95","year":"1979","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/15845"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15043,"name":"Potter Stewart","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/potter_stewart","view_count":0,"last_name":"Stewart","roles":[{"id":2687,"type":"scotus_justice","date_start":-353962800,"date_end":362984400,"appointing_president":"Dwight D.

Parham was never married to the child\u0027s mother, but he signed the child\u0027s birth certificate and provided financial support. Parham never legitimated his child as available under Georgia law. After the child\u0027s death, Parham attempted to bring a wrongful death action on behalf of his illegitimate child. A Georgia statute barred fathers from bringing wrongful death actions on behalf of illegitimate children. The trial court held that the law violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court of Georgia reversed, finding that the classification involved was reasonably related to legitimate state interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Georgia statute prohibiting biological fathers from bringing wrongful death actions on behalf of illegitimate children violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the 14th Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision the Court held that the law does not violate the Equal Protection or Due Process clause. Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority deciding that the statute did not invidiously discriminate because legitimacy is not an immutable characteristic. The law is also rationally related to the state interest in avoiding the difficulties in proving paternity of illegitimate children in wrongful death actions. Justice Lewis F. Powell concurred in the judgment but felt the proper level of scrutiny was that a law must be substantially related to an important governmental interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a dissent stating that the statute discriminates on the basis of sex by requiring unmarried fathers to take additional measures not required of unwed mothers in order to prove the legitimacy of his parenthood. Justice William J. Brennan, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42757,"name":"Thomas E.

William Orr was ordered to pay monthly alimony of $1,240. Lillian Orr sued William Orr for lack of payments in July 1976. Alabama\u0027s alimony statutes only required husbands to pay alimony, but not wives. William Orr challenged these statutes as unconstitutional. The Lee County Circuit Court ruled against him. The Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama affirmed this ruling. The Supreme Court of Alabama granted a writ of certiorari that was later dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the Supreme Court have jurisdiction over William Orr\u0027s challenge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Do Alabama\u0027s alimony statutes violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. In a 6-3 opinion, the Court established its jurisdiction over the question and ruled that Alabama\u0027s statutes were unconstitutional. In writing for the majority, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. maintained that under the Equal Protection Clause, \"classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives.\" The Court rejected several objectives proposed by the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals, holding that gender was not an \"accurate proxy\" for financial need.

One Golden Fleece went to federal agencies sponsoring the research of Ronald Hutchinson, a behavioral scientist. Proxmire detailed the \"nonsense\" of Hutchinson\u0027s research on the floor of the Senate, in conferences with his staff, and in a newsletter sent to over 100,000 of his constituents. Hutchinson sued for libel, arguing that Proxmire\u0027s statements defamed his character and caused him to endure financial loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWere Proxmire\u0027s activities and statements against Hutchinson\u0027s research protected by the Speech and Debate Clause of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court affirmed the decision of the lower court and held that Proxmire\u0027s statements in his newsletters and press releases were not protected by the Speech and Debate Clause. However, in upholding this ruling, the Court also found that Proxmire\u0027s statements were not made with \"actual malice\" and thus, were not libelous. Chief Justice Burger, relying on the Court\u0027s finding in Doe v. McMillan (1973), concluded that while speeches in Congress and discussions with staff were protected by Section 6, statements in newsletters and press releases were not because they were not \"essential to the deliberations of the Senate\" nor were they part of the legislature\u0027s \"deliberative process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35573,"name":"Michael E.

The Sims moved to modify the Harris County court order granting custody to the state.  When they were not able to obtain and immediate hearing, the Sims filed a writ of habeas corpus.  The court transferred the matter to Montgomery County.  Rather than proceeding with the case in Montgomery County, the Sims sued in Federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of Texas’ child custody laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court issued a preliminary injunction preventing Texas from prosecuting any state suit under the child custody laws.  The court held that abstention under \u003ci\u003eYounger v Harris\u003c/i\u003e was improper because of the multifaceted nature of the litigation.  The federal court addressed the constitutional issues in their decision.  Under \u003ci\u003eYounger v Harris\u003c/i\u003e, a federal court must abstain from ruling in a case where there are pending related claims in state court.  The Supreme Court heard this case on direct appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court have jurisdiction to rule while there were related pending state claims?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion reversing the district court.  The Supreme Court held that the federal court did not have jurisdiction while the state law claims were pending.  There was no indication that the state court would be unable to reach the constitutional issues themselves.

Michael was already on probation and had a long history of criminal offenses.  Before questioning, policed informed Michael of his Fifth Amendment rights under \u003ci\u003eMiranda v Arizona\u003c/i\u003e, 384 U.S. 436(1966).  Michael asked for his parole officer, but police said he was not available.  Police offered Michael an attorney, which he refused.  During questioning, Michael made incriminating statements that linked himself to the murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Michael moved to suppress statements and sketches he drew during police questioning.  The trial court denied the motion.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of California reversed, holding that Michael’s request for his probation officer automatically invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination just as if Michael had asked for an attorney.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes a juvenile’s request for his probation officer trigger the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 5-4 decision, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion reversing the state court.  The Supreme Court held that a juvenile’s request for a probation officer does not invoke the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.  A court must look at the totality of the circumstances in each case to determine whether a juvenile waived that right.  In this case, Michael knowingly waived his right to remain silent, so all evidence obtained during the police questioning is admissible in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissent, stating that \u003ci\u003eMiranda\u003c/i\u003e requires police questioning to stop whenever a juvenile requests an adult who represents his interests.  The case-by-case approach does not provide police with adequate guidance for future procedure.  Justices William J. Brennan and John Paul Stevens joined in the dissent.  Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote a dissent, expressing that police subjected Michael to a coercive interrogation.\u003cbr /\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36043,"name":"Mark Alan Hart","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/mark_alan_hart","view_count":0,"last_name":"Hart","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"mark_alan_hart"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11197"},{"advocate":{"ID":16579,"name":"Albert J.

For 77-1546, in 1972, U. S. Attorney William Stafford, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida Stuart Carrouth, and Department of Justice Attorney Guy Goodwin conducted a grand jury investigation into a conspiracy to cause a riot in Florida. Respondents were among the group subpoenaed to appear and testify. During the course of the proceedings, Goodwin stated under oath that there were no government agents in the witness lineup called by respondents’ counsel. Respondents later sued Stafford, Carrouth, Goodwin, and FBI Agent Claude Meadow in their individual and official capacities for falsely testifying and conspiring to deprive the respondents of statutory rights. Respondents sued in the District Court for the District of Columbia, where Goodwin resided. The petitioners requested a transfer to the Northern District of Florida or a dismissal based on improper venue. The district court denied the motion to transfer but granted the motion to dismiss. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and held that the venue was proper because Goodwin was a resident of the District of Columbia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor 78-393, from 1953 until 1973, CIA agents regularly opened and photocopied mail going through the International Airport in New York to and from the Soviet Union. In 1975, respondents sued on their behalf and on the behalf of others whose mail had been opened by the CIA. Respondents sued in the district court of Rhode Island and alleged that the interference with their mail constituted a violation of their constitutional rights. Petitioners moved to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, and insufficient service of process. The district court denied these motions but certified the case for an immediate appeal. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the denial of the motions as they relate to petitioners employed by the CIA at the time of filing, but reversed as to the officials who had left their government positions at the time of filing. The Court of Appeals held that the venue was proper because one of the petitioners resided in Rhode Island.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDo the venue provisions in Section 2 of the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 apply to officers of the federal government acting in their individual capacities?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion of the 5-2 majority. The Supreme Court held that the language of the statute clearly indicated that Congress meant to restrict the applicability of the statute to employees currently employed by the government at the time of filing. Additionally, the legislative history of the statute shows Congress’ desire to restrict civil actions against governmental officials to those acting in their official capacity. Congress only allowed governmental officials to be sued nominally in their individual capacity in order to circumvent some vestiges of sovereign immunity. The Court held that, regardless of the venue, the case must be essentially against the United States government, rather than against officers in their individual capacities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent and argued that the Act unambiguously allowed civil suits to be brought against government employees in their individual capacities to circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity. He argued that the legislative history supported a broader reading of what the Act allows in civil suits against government officers. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R.

Martin refused to comply with this requirement and did not receive a pay increase each year her contract was renewed.  The Oklahoma legislature passed a law requiring a mandatory pay increase every year regardless of compliance with the continuing education.  Looking for an alternative consequence, the school board warned Martin that they would not renew her contract the following year if she did not complete her continuing education.  Martin refused, and the school board voted to terminate her for “willful neglect of duty”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter unsuccessfully attempting to obtain administrative relief, Martin sued the school district for Fourteenth Amendment violations.

In an 8-to-1 decision, the Court held that the privacy interests of travelers outweighed the state interests in discretionary spot checks of automobiles. The Court found that random checks made only marginal contributions to roadway safety and compliance with registration requirements; less intrusive means could have been used to serve the same ends. Officers must be held to a \"probable cause\" standard for searches, otherwise individuals would be subject to \"unfettered governmental intrusion\" each time they entered an automobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":19751,"name":"Charles M.

She was able to give the police a description of the robber and the 1975 Monte Carlo she thought the robber was driving. Within a few days, she began receiving threatening phone calls that culminated in the caller telling her to stand on her porch, from where she observed the same Monte Carlo drive past. On March 16, the police observed the car in McDonough\u0027s neighborhood. By running a search on the license plate number, the police learned the car was registered to Michael Lee Smith. The police contacted the telephone company and requested that a pen register, a device that only records numbers dialed, record the numbers dialed from the telephone at Smith\u0027s home. On March 17, the pen register recorded a call from Smith\u0027s phone to McDonough\u0027s home, so the police obtained a warrant to search Smith\u0027s house. During the search, police discovered a phone book with the corner turned down on the page on which McDonough\u0027s name was found. Smith was arrested and placed in a line-up where McDonough identified him as the man who robbed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn pretrial, Smith filed a motion to suppress the information derived from the installation of the pen register because it was obtained without a warrant. The trial court denied the motion, Smith waived a jury, and the case was submitted to the court with an agreed-upon statement of facts. The court convicted Smith and sentenced him to six years in prison. Smith appealed to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, but the Maryland Court of Appeals intervened by issuing a writ of certiorari. That court affirmed the conviction and held that there was no expectation of privacy to cover the numbers dialed into a telephone system, so there was no Fourth Amendment violation of the warrant requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the use of a pen register without a warrant violate the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun delivered the opinion for the 5-3 majority. The Court held that Fourth Amendment protections are only relevant if the individual believes that the government has infringed on the individual\u0027s reasonable expectation of privacy. This reasonable expectation of privacy does not apply to the numbers recorded by a pen register because those numbers are used in the regular conduct of the phone company\u0027s business, a fact of which individuals are aware. Because the Fourth Amendment does not apply to information that is voluntarily given to third parties, the telephone numbers that are regularly and voluntarily provided to telephone companies by their customers do not gain Fourth Amendment protections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Potter Stewart wrote a dissent in which he argued that a person who uses a telephone has a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the content of call. Because the telephone numbers dialed also contain information relating to the content of the call, that information is also protected by the Fourth Amendment. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the dissent. In his separate dissent, Justice Thurgood Marshall argued that the majority opinion\u0027s analysis depends on an individual\u0027s choice to voluntarily turn over information, but that choice is not valid if no practical alternative exists. He wrote that no citizen should be forced to accept government monitoring of the phone numbers he dials simply by registering a phone with a telephone company. Such government intrusion on telephone records could impede the exercise of free speech or political affiliation. Therefore phone records should be subject to the Fourth Amendment\u0027s protections. Justice Brennan also joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26801,"name":"Howard L.

At Butler’s interrogation, the officer gave Butler an “Advice of Rights” form and asked him to sign it to indicate that he understood his rights.  Butler refused to sign the waiver portion of the form, but indicated that he would like to talk to the officer.  Butler did not ask for an attorney.  Butler proceeded to make incriminating statements, which were introduced as evidence at trial.  Butler moved to suppress the evidence, but the trial court denied the motion.  The court held that Butler had effectively waived his right to an attorney when he spoke with the FBI officer after indicating that he understood his rights.  The jury found Butler guilty of kidnapping, armed robbery, and felonious assault.  On appeal, the Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed the convictions and ordered a new trial, holding that statements made under interrogation are not admissible without an express waiver of rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a defendant’s self-incriminating testimony inadmissible when there is no express waiver of \u003ci\u003eMiranda\u003c/i\u003e rights?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo.  In a 5-3 decision, Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion reversing and remanding.  The Supreme Court held that \u003ci\u003eMiranda\u003c/i\u003e did not require adopting an inflexible per se rule.  Also, 10 of 11 U.S. Courts of Appeals have held that express waiver is not necessary.  It is up to the lower court to determine whether Butler impliedly waived his rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harry A.

Its property was purchased using funds contributed entirely by local church members. The year it was organized, Vineville was established as a member of the Augusta-Macon Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in the United States (“PCUS”). Under the PCUS’s hierarchical structure, the actions of the government of a local church were subject to the review and control of the higher church courts: the Presbytery, Synod, and General Assembly. The powers and duties of each court were set forth in the constitution of the PCUS, the Book of Church Order. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn May 27, 1973, 164 members of Vineville’s congregation voted to separate from the PCUS and join the Presbyterian Church in America; ninety-four members opposed the resolution. The Augusta-Macon Presbytery appointed a commission to investigate and resolve the dispute. This commission eventually ruled that the minority faction at Vineville was the true congregation of Vineville, withdrawing all authority from the majority faction, which took no part in the commission’s inquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minority faction brought a class action in state court, seeking declaratory and injunctive orders establishing their right to exclusive possession and use of Vineville’s property. The trial court, relying on Georgia’s “neutral principles of law” approach to church property disputes, found for the majority faction. The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the ruling, holding that the trial court correctly applied Georgia law and rejecting the minority faction’s claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the First Amendment require the district court to defer to the Augusta-Macon Presbytery commission’s ruling that a minority faction constituted the “true congregation” of Vineville Presbyterian Church?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the Court held that the First Amendment did not require Georgia state courts to defer to the Augusta-Macon Presbytery commission’s ruling in the Vineville church property dispute. Justice Blackman examined the history of Georgia’s approach to church property litigation. Georgia eventually arrived at a “neutral principles of law” method for resolving church property disputes. As applied to the PCUS, this required examining the deeds to the properties in question, state statutes dealing with implied trusts, and the Book of Church Order. The trial court would then determine whether there was a basis for a trust in favor of the general church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, the trial court did not discover any language in the Book of Church Order implying a trust in favor of the general church. While acknowledging that the First Amendment severely limits the role civil courts play in resolving property disputes, Justice Blackmun held that Georgia’s approach was constitutional. The neutral principles of law approach required courts to use objective, well-established concepts of trust and property law, leaving courts free from entanglement in religious doctrinal questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Georgia’s approach was constitutional on its face, Justice Blackmun could not determine from the facts whether Georgia courts applied the method constitutionally. While the respondent argued that Georgia applied a presumptive rule of majority representation -- as opposed to a rule of deference to church governments -- neither the Supreme Court of Georgia nor the trial court explicitly stated that it was using this rule. Consequently, Justice Blackmun remanded the case so that the Supreme Court of Georgia could definitively determine whether this rule was the law of Georgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Louis Powell dissented, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Potter Stewart and Byron White. He characterized the dispute not as one over the ownership of property but rather over which faction in Vineville’s congregation has the right to control the use of that property. Justice Powell argued that disputes over church property almost invariably arise out of disagreements regarding doctrine and practice. Consequently, state courts should defer to decisions made within the structure of church governments in any case involving an intrachurch dispute, even when the dispute is over church property.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22982,"name":"E.

The Parole Board would then determine whether the inmate was a good candidate for release and, if so, schedule a final hearing. Inmates scheduled for a final hearing were informed in advance of the month in which the hearing would take place, but did not receive notice of the specific date until the morning of the hearing. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex filed a class action in federal district court alleging that the discretionary parole procedures used by the Parole Board violated their rights to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court held that the procedures did not satisfy due process and, on appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals instructed the Parole Board to modify its procedures to provide each inmate eligible for parole with a full formal hearing and, in the event of an adverse decision, a statement of evidence relied on by the Board.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to discretionary parole release determinations made by a state’s board of parole?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1) If so, did the procedures employed by the Nebraska Board of Parole satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes and yes. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the opinion for the 5-4 majority. The Court held that, although there is no constitutional right to an inmate’s release from prison prior to the expiration of a valid sentence, the specific wording of the Nebraska statute created a constitutionally protected expectation of parole. The Court further held that the Parole Board’s procedures were adequate and reversed the prescribed modifications from the Court of Appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. reasoned that a state’s establishment of a parole problem, regardless of the specific wording of the statute, triggered a right to procedural due process. Justice Powell agreed that the Court of Appeal’s recommendations were unnecessary, but he argued that the Parole Board should provide inmates with at least 72 hours notice of their hearing date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that all prisoners potentially eligible for parole have a right to due process.

Duren alleged that the selection of this jury violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to a trial by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community.  Specifically, Jackson County allowed an automatic exemption from jury service for women upon request.  While women made up 54% of the population in the Jackson County, only 26.7% of people summoned from the jury wheel were women.  Defendant had an all-male jury selected from a panel of 48 men and 5 women.  The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, questioning the validity of Duren’s statistics.  The court also held that even if women were disproportionally excluded from jury service, the amount of women who participated in the process was well above constitutional standards.\u003cbr /\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Jackson County’s practice of automatically exempting women from jury duty on request violate the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees to a trial by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes.  Justice Byron R. White, writing for an 8-1 majority, reversed the state court and remanded.  The Supreme Court held that Duren’s statistical evidence sufficiently proved that Jackson County’s jury selection process violated his constitutional rights.  Duren showed an underrepresented “distinctive” group resulting from Jackson County’s practice of exempting women.  Also, there was no significant state interest to justify exempting women from jury service.  Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented, arguing that the majority incorrectly used an combination of the Due Process clause and Equal Protection clause to make their decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34903,"name":"Lee M.

No mandatory retirement age was specified for employees covered by the Civil Service retirement system. Holbrook Bradley, a member of the Foreign Service retirement system, challenged the statute in United States District Court for the District of Columbia and prevailed. The government appealed to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Section 632 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 violate the Equal Protection component of the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-1 opinion written by Justice Byron R. White, the Court emphasized the distinction between the Civil Service and Foreign Service, and the \"special attention\" paid to the Foreign Service by Congress. The Court interpreted the purpose of Section 632 to be the encouragement of the \"highest performance in the ranks of the Foreign Service by assuring that opportunities for promotion would be available,\" a legitimate interest that justified the distinction. The Court also recognized the possibility that service in the Foreign Service would be more rigorous than service in the Civil Service.

Both were heroin addicts undergoing methadone treatment. NYTA maintained a policy against hiring anyone using narcotics. Methadone was considered a narcotic, and both Beazer and Reyes were terminated after NYTA learned of their methadone use. Beazer and Reyes filed a class action against the Transit Authority, alleging that NYTA\u0027s policy discriminated against blacks and Hispanics. They cited a statistic showing that 81 percent of suspected violations of NYTA\u0027s policy were black or Hispanic. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled for Beazer, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the New York Transit Authority\u0027s prohibition against the hiring of anybody using methadone violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a 6-3 opinion, the Court reversed the Second Circuit and held that the Transit Authority\u0027s policy was not unconstitutional or illegal under the Civil Rights Act. Writing for the majority, Justice Stevens described Beazer\u0027s statistical argument as \"weak\", as the 81 percent statistic did not relate to methadone users specifically. The Court recognized the public safety interest in keeping narcotics users from working for NYTA. The narcotics rule was an allowable policy choice made by NYTA, and any specific exemption for methadone users from the narcotics rule would have been \"costly\" and \"imprecise.\" Justice Lewis Powell wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":32250,"name":"Joan Offner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/joan_offner","view_count":0,"last_name":"Offner","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"joan_offner"},"advocate_description":"argued the cause for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11341"},{"advocate":{"ID":20910,"name":"Deborah M.

On August 10, 1971, the police received a lead implicating Irving Dunaway, but the lead did not provide enough information to arrest him. Nevertheless, the police brought him in for questioning. He was not told he was under arrest, but he would be physically restrained if he attempted to leave. After being informed of his Miranda rights, Dunaway waived his right to counsel and made statements and a drawing that incriminated himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt trial, Dunaway filed a motion to suppress the evidence of his confession and drawing. The motion was denied and he was convicted. The Appellate Division of the Fourth Department and the New York Court of Appeals both affirmed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of \u003ci\u003eBrown v. Illinois\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Monroe County Court determined that the motion to suppress should have been granted under \u003ci\u003eBrown\u003c/i\u003e. The Appellate Division of the Fourth Department reversed and held that suspects can be detained and questioned without violating Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights. The New York Court of Appeals dismissed Dunaway’s application for leave to appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs bringing a suspect into custody for questioning subject to the same probable cause standards as an arrest?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003e Yes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 6-2 majority. The Supreme Court held that the police violated Dunaway’s Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights by picking him up and taking him to the police station to be questioned without probable cause. Because picking someone up for questioning involves an intrusion on par with that of an arrest, it is held to the standard of “probable cause” rather than the lower standard of “reasonable suspicion.” The Court also held that the confession stemmed directly from the illegal questioning, and without an intervening event, the confession should have been considered tainted evidence and not allowed into evidence at trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White wrote a concurring opinion in which he argued that the key principle of the Fourth Amendment was the balancing of competing interests. He wrote that, while there must be general rules for police conduct, cases should be considered based on their individual facts. In this case, the questioning was too close to an arrest to fit any other criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that an illegal arrest is only relevant to determining the voluntariness of a confession if it can be shown that the conduct of the illegal arrest was what motivated the confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissent, arguing that not all interactions between citizens and police officers are seizures of persons. Because Dunaway willingly accompanied officers to the police station, his time at the police station could not be deemed a seizure. He also argued that, because the police acted in good faith and gave Dunaway the Miranda warnings, his statements and drawings should be considered voluntary and admissible. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22894,"name":"Edward J.

His mother then filed a petition for his permanent confinement in a mental health facility. At trial, evidence was presented that Addington suffered from serious delusions, and two physicians testified that he was a psychotic schizophrenic. The jury was instructed to decide Addington’s mental state and whether he was a possible threat to himself and others by weighing the “clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence.” The jury determined the evidence was sufficient, and Addington was sentenced to Austin State Hospital for an indefinite amount of time. He appealed on the grounds that the jury should have been instructed to evaluate the evidence using the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard. The state appellate court remanded his case stating that his rights had been violated when the jury was improperly instructed on the burden of proof. The Supreme Court of Texas overturned the appellate court’s decision and reinstated the trial court’s finding by holding that the standard of proof used in the initial jury instructions was adequate for a civil proceeding and did not violate Addington’s due process rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs the proper standard of proof for a civil case of involuntary commitment to a mental health facility whether the evidence presented to the jury was “clear, unequivocal, and convincing”?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe standard of proof in a civil confinement case requires a burden of proof higher than a preponderance of the evidence, but not as high as the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal cases. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote the opinion for the unanimous Court, which held that the use of the “clear, unequivocal, and convincing” evidence standard in a jury instruction in a civil commitment case was proper. Because of the importance of the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard set forth in criminal proceedings, the Court was weary of requiring the same standard for civil proceedings. Furthermore, this case involved psychiatric evaluation, which was not considered reliable evidence. A “beyond a reasonable doubt” requirement in cases involving mental diagnosis may be too high a burden for the state to reach. Therefore, the middle ground of requiring a “clear and convincing” standard of proof was appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. took no part in the consideration or or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31305,"name":"Joel I.

On one occasion, Wolston failed to respond to a subpoena and pleaded guilty to a contempt charge. The incident was publicized in newspapers, but Wolston succeeded in returning to life as a private citizen. In 1974, Reader’s Digest Association published a book by John Barron about the KGB and Soviet agents in the United States. The book and its index identified Wolston as a Soviet agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolston sued the author and publishers for libel in district court. The district court granted summary judgment for the Association and held that Wolston was a “public figure” and had to prove the Association acted with actual malice to prevail in a libel suit. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs Wolston a public figure and required to prove actual malice in order to win a libel suit?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 8-1 majority. The Supreme Court held that Wolston met neither of the requirements to be considered a public figure. Wolston was not a figure of “persuasive power and influence,” nor did he thrust himself to the forefront of popular controversy. The Court held that an individual does not become a public figure merely by attracting public attention, and such individuals should not lose the protection afforded to private individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote that the majority’s decision defined “public figure” too narrowly, but the intervening years between Wolston’s publicity and the libelous statement sufficed to consider him a private citizen. Blackmun argued that the timing of the potentially libelous statement relative to the event that brought about public scrutiny of an individual is relevant in libel cases. Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a dissent and argued that, because the issue of Soviet espionage remained a relevant issue in 1974, the intervening years did not diminish Wolston’s status as a public figure. He also wrote that the district court erred in granting summary judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41207,"name":"Sidney Dickstein","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/sidney_dickstein","view_count":0,"last_name":"Dickstein","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"sidney_dickstein"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/11366"},{"advocate":{"ID":29267,"name":"John J.

They argued that an \"unabated buildup\" of adverse publicity had jeopardized their ability to receive a fair trial. The request was granted by the judge, and no objections were made at the time. The judge then denied press access to the pre-trial hearing and refused to immediately release the transcript of the proceedings. The case was argued and decided with Marshall, Secretary of Labor v.

The Court noted that judges had \"an affirmative constitutional duty\" to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial publicity, and that closure of pretrial proceedings was an effective method to do so. The Court found that the Sixth Amendment, while granting defendants the right to a public trial, did not imply a public right of access to trials. The Court added that since the suppression of the transcript was only temporary, no violation of the First Amendment had occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38617,"name":"Robert C.
