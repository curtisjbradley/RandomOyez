There were six men in the car, including Robert Clyde Bustamonte.  Only one passenger had a drivers license, and he claimed that his brother owned the car.  The officer asked this man if he could search the car.  The man said, “Sure, go ahead.”  Inside the car, the officer found stolen checks.  Those checks were admitted into evidence at Bustamonte’s trial for possessing checks with the intent to defraud.  A jury convicted Bustamonte, and the California Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District affirmed.  The court reasoned that consent to search the car was given voluntarily, so evidence obtained during the search was admissible.  The California Supreme Court denied review.  Bustamonte filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the district court denied.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that consent is not voluntary unless it is proven that the person who consented to the search knew he had the right to refuse consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Did the court of appeals err when it held that the search of the car was invalid because the state failed to show consent given with knowledge that it could be withheld?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Should claims relating to search and seizure be available to a prisoner filing a writ of habeus corpus?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, No answer.  Justice Potter Stewart, writing for a 6-3 majority, reversed.  The Supreme Court held that whether consent is voluntary can be determined from the totality of the circumstances.  It is unnecessary to prove that the person who gave consent knew that he had the right to refuse.  The Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures does not require a knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights.  Because the Fourth Amendment claims had no merit, the Court did not reach the second question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Lewis F. Powell also concurred, stating that the main question should be whether Bustamonte had a fair opportunity to raise his Fourth Amendment claims.  Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the concurrence. Justice Harry A. Blackmun concurred, agreeing with the majority and noting it was unnecessary to reach the issue discussed by Justice Powell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas dissented, arguing that the Ninth Circuit made the correct decision.  Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote a separate dissent, stating that a person cannot waive their Fourth Amendment rights when he is unaware that his rights would be constitutionally protected if he did not waive those rights.  Justice Thurgood Marshall arguing that the prosecution cannot rely on consent to a search if the person who gave consent did not know he could refuse consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":39374,"name":"Robert R.

Federal law provided that the wives of members of the military automatically became dependents; husbands of female members of the military, however, were not accepted as dependents unless they were dependent on their wives for over one-half of their support. Frontiero\u0027s request for dependent status for her husband was turned down.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid a federal law, requiring different qualification criteria for male and female military spousal dependency, unconstitutionally discriminate against women thereby violating the Fifth Amendment\u0027s Due Process Clause?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. The Court held that the statute in question clearly commanded \"dissimilar treatment for men and women who are similarly situated,\" violating the Due Process Clause and the equal protection requirements that clause implied. A majority could not agree on the standard of review, however. The plurality opinion written by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., applying a strict standard of review to the sex-based classification as it would to racial classification, found that the government\u0027s interest in administrative convenience could not justify discriminatory practices. But a concurring opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell and joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Harry A. Blackmun would not go so far as to hold sex discrimination to the same standard as race, choosing instead to argue that statutes drawing lines between the sexes alone necessarily involved the \"very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Constitution,\" an approach employed in the Court\u0027s prior decision in Reed v. Reed. Justice Potter Stewart concurred separately that the statutes created invidious discrimination in violation of the Constitution. Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented affirming the reasoning of the lower court opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31434,"name":"Joseph J.

The plan for the House of Representatives provided for 100 representatives from 52 districts with each House member representing an average of 46,485 constituents(with a variance between largest and smallest being 16.4 percent, compared to the ideal 3.89 percent). Henry Howell challenged the plan as unconstitutional because its population deviations were too large to satisfy the principle of \"one person, one vote.\" This case was decided together with City of Virginia Beach v. Howell and Weinberg v. Prichard.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas the Virginia reapportionment plan invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eThe Court found that the plan was constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause as described in Reynolds v. Sims. The Virginia plan is not to be judged by the more stringent congressional standards in Section 2 of Article I. The Equal Protection Clause requires a state to make an \"honest and good faith effort\" to construct districts of as nearly equal population as practicable. Some deviations from the equal population principle are valid if based on legitimate considerations of a \"rational state policy.\" The Virginia plan advanced the policy of reapportionment without sacrificing substantial equality.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16592,"name":"Andrew P.

Ash Jr. was indicted for robbing the American Trust \u0026amp; Security Company in Washington, D.C. Before his trial, almost three years after the robbery, an FBI agent and a prosecutor showed five color mug shot photographs to potential witnesses to make sure they would be able to make an in court identification of Ash. Ash’s counsel was not present for this process. Some of these witnesses then made in court identifications of Ash. Ash was convicted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that Ash’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because his attorney was not given the opportunity to be present for the photo identifications before trial. The court of appeals opinion expressed doubt that the in court identifications could have happened without the prior photo identifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Sixth Amendment require the presence of defendant’s counsel at a pretrial showing of photographs to prospective witnesses?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for a 7-3 majority, reversed the court of appeals and remanded. The Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee the right to counsel for photographic displays held for the purpose of allowing a witness to attempt an identification of the offender. A photographic display is different from a line up, because the accused is not present and is not in danger of being misled or overpowered by the opposing attorney. Justice Potter Stewart concurred in the judgment, stating that pretrial photographic displays are not a critical stage of prosecution. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. dissented, arguing that there is no meaningful difference between a pretrial lineup and a pretrial photo identification, so the right to counsel should extend in both circumstances. Justice William O. Douglas and Justice Thurgood Marshall joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":22634,"name":"Edward R.

In 1967, she married a U.S. citizen and became a resident of Connecticut. She then attended Yale Law School and applied to take the Connecticut Bar in 1970. Despite the County Bar Association finding her qualified in every aspect, she was denied the chance to sit for the exam due to the fact that she was not a U.S. citizen, which Rule 8(1) of the Connecticut Practice Book of 1963 required. Griffiths requested judicial relief and argued that the rule was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Superior Court of Connecticut denied her request for judicial relief and the Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Connecticut Bar’s requirement that applicants be US citizens violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eA requirement that applicants to the state bar be United States citizens violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 7-2 majority. The Court held that, while it is within a state’s rights to carefully select who may practice law, to deny an immigrant solely on their immigrant status is unconstitutional. A lawfully admitted resident alien is a “person” within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and is therefore protected by the Equal Protection Clause. Because classifications based on nationality are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny, the state must meet a high burden to justify such a classification. In this case, the state bar association did not meet that burden because there is no meaningful connection between citizenship and the qualifications for being a lawyer. The United States has always “welcomed and [drawn] strength from the immigration of aliens,” and their social and economic contributions to the country have been innumerable. Additionally, there is precedent to support the proposition that citizenship does not matter in reference to practicing law in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the government should be justified in requiring certain jobs to be held by citizens, as the government has a vested interest in ensuring that specialized positions such as lawyers are held by citizens to, among other things, ensure their “moral character.” In his separate dissent, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that, as an “officer of the court,” states retain the right to exclude aliens from practicing the law. The Constitution grants states the right to determine who is appropriate for representing the state in court, even if that should mean excluding anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen. Justice William H. Rehnquist joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38635,"name":"R.

The only major evidence against him was Ms. Beamer’s identification several weeks after the incident at a police station “show up”.  The “show up” was similar to a line up, but contained the suspect alone.  The police officer also had the suspect say phrases Ms. Beamer heard her attacker say on the night of the rape.  Ms. Beamer said she had “no doubt” that Biggers was her attacker.  The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the conviction.  The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed by an equally divided court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiggers then filed a writ of habeas corpus, which the district court granted, holding that the Supreme Court affirming by an equally divided court did not bar the writ.  The court also held that the “show up” procedure was so suggestive that it violated due process.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Does the Supreme Court’s order affirming a conviction by an equally divided court bar habeas corpus proceedings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Was the “show up” procedure so suggestive that it violated due process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, No.  In a 5-3 decision Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote the majority opinion reversing in part and remanding.  The entire court joined in the first part of the opinion, holding that affirming by an equally divided court did not constitute an “actual adjudication” of the issue.  The habeas corpus proceeding could continue.  Only five justices joined in the second part of the opinion, holding that the “show up” procedure was suggestive, but given the totality of the circumstances, there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William J. Brennan wrote a dissent, stating that the decision on the “show up” procedure broke from the long established practice of affirming findings of fact concurred in by two lower courts.

The National Organization for Women, Inc. filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that the Pittsburgh Press Co. (Pittsburg Press) violated the ordinance by allowing employers to place advertisements in the male or female columns when the jobs advertised do not have occupational qualifications or exceptions. The Commission had a hearing and concluded Pittsburg Press violated the ordinance. The Pittsburg Press appealed and contended the ordinance violates the First Amendment by restricting its editorial judgment. The Commonwealth Court affirmed. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes an ordinance that forbids newspapers to advertise employment opportunities in gender-designated columns violate the freedom of press guaranteed by the First Amendment? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion of the 5-4 majority. The Court held that the Pittsburg ordinance, which forbids newspapers to carry gender-designated advertising columns for job opportunities, does not violate their First Amendment rights. This clause in the ordinance does not deny the newspapers freedom of expression, nor does it hinder the newspapers’ financial profits. The First Amendment does not protect advertisements for purely commercial reasons. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the majority broadens the “commercial speech” doctrine to include the layout and organizations decisions of a newspaper, which violates the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a separate dissenting opinion in which he argued that the First Amendment protects commercial advertisements and that newspapers should be able to print whatever they want because of the freedom of the press. In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Potter Stewart argued that the First Amendment protects all freedoms of the press and that any expression should be unrestrained by government. Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined in this dissent. \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":36334,"name":"Marjorie H.

Their mathematical procedure was somewhat akin to long division, albeit with different steps. Their attorney argued before the patent examiner that the inventors were entitled to a broad patent covering any use of their new mathematical procedure, even use of it by a human using pencil and paper. The examiner rejected their invention. An appellate court overruled the examiner and ordered a patent to issue. The Commissioner of Patents then petitioned successfully to have the Supreme Court review this decision. Before the Supreme Court, the inventors\u0027 attorney backed down from his earlier position and argued that the inventors were entitled to a patent covering all uses of their new mathematical procedure in computers, but not necessarily to its use by humans using pencil and paper. (The members of the Supreme Court at that time knew very little about computers.)\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a computer program patentable? More specifically, is a mathematical procedure such as long division patentable?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. The Supreme Court held that a patent cannot cover all possible uses of a mathematical procedure or equation within a computer. That would be tantamount to granting the inventor a patent on the mathematical procedure itself, and this was no more acceptable than granting Samuel Morse a patent covering all possible uses of magnetism to communicate, rather than a narrower patent covering only the specific way in which Morse actually used magnetism to communicate in his telegraph. The court then said that \"[i]f these programs are to be patentable, considerable problems are raised which only committees of Congress can manage ....\" This decision was accepted as a final determination that computer programs were not patentable, and the Patent Office immediately ceased examining all computer program inventions. Very few patent applications directed to computer programs were filed until after the Supreme Court readdressed this issue in Diamond v. Diehr some nine years later. During these nine years, alternative ways of protecting computer programs were developed under the laws of copyright and trade secret which remain part of our law today.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":26750,"name":"Hugh B.

Russell challenged his conviction as the result of unconstitutional entrapment practices, since an undercover agent supplied him with an essential ingredient of his drug manufacturing operation.

In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that law enforcement officers may participate in the procedural commission of certain crimes such as drug manufacturing, so long as they do not implant criminal designs in the minds of the accused. In Russell\u0027s case, the investigated drug operations were in place long before undercover agents infiltrated them. Moreover, the ingredients contributed by the agents could have been acquired independently by Russell and his co-conspirators.

Scarpelli signed an agreement allowing him to reside in Illinois and was supervised by the Adult Probation Department of Illinois. Shortly after, Scarpelli was caught committing burglary with an accomplice. After being informed of his Constitutional rights, Scarpelli admitted to committing the felony, an admission he later claimed was made under extreme duress. The Wisconsin Department of Corrections revoked Scarpelli’s probation because of the violation and imprisoned him. He was not given a hearing. Two years later, Scarpelli filed a writ of habeas corpus and the district court held that revoking Scarpelli’s probation without a hearing and an attorney was a denial of his Constitutional right of due process. Gagnon, the warden of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, appealed and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courts judgment. Gagnon appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs a previously sentenced probationer entitled to a hearing when his probation is revoked?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, is he entitled to representation by an attorney at the hearing?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes, no. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 8-1majority. The Court held a previously sentenced probationer is entitled to a hearing when his probation is revoked. While a probation hearing is not part of the criminal prosecution process, the results of the hearing could cause the defendant to suffer a substantial loss of liberty, and therefore the defendant has the right to due process. However, the Constitution does not require that the defendant be provided proper representation. Rather, the court appointment of an attorney should be applied on a case-by-case basis. The Court concluded there was no need to create a new rule of appointing an attorney, and the lower courts should use their discretion when deciding if a court-appointed attorney was necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissent in which he argued that court-appointed counsel was necessary to ensure the defendant was afforded due process\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":45863,"name":"William A.

The appellees, a group of holders of various liquor licenses, sought discretionary review of the new regulations. The district court held that the regulations unconstitutionally limited freedom of expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes California’s prohibition of certain sexual acts on premises where liquor is sold violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice William H. Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that states have the right to regulate expression that consists of “conduct or action” especially in the absence of a particular message. Since the California regulations did not prohibit all such behavior and performances but only those in certain locations that hold liquor licenses, the regulations did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that states have the authority to regulate where and under what conditions alcohol is sold. The exercise of that authority does not violate the constitutional rights of the proprietors and employees of alcohol-serving establishments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that constitutional questions the case presents should not have been addressed until the regulations had been applied and the state courts had decided how strictly they should be construed. In his separate dissent, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. argued that the regulations required the owner of a nightclub to curtail First Amendment expression to obtain a liquor license. States do not have the power to impose an unconstitutional condition on the granting of a license. Justice Thurgood Marshall also wrote a separate dissent where he argued that the regulations were too broad and lacked the precision necessary to avoid violating constitutional rights. The California regulations create even stricter standards than the Supreme Court’s ruling in regards to obscenity. He argued that the state’s authority to regulate the sale of alcohol does not allow it to override the protections of the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34971,"name":"L.

These amendments included Section 1, which provided a grant for the maintenance and repair of schools that served many low-income students; Section 2, which provided tuition reimbursement for low-income parents; and Sections 3, 4, and 5, which provided tax relief for parents who did not qualify for tuition reimbursement. After the institution of these amendments, the Campaign for Public Education and Religious Liberty challenged the amendments in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that these amendments violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The District Court held that Sections 1 and 2 violated the Establishment Clause, but not Sections 3, 4, and 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Sections 1-5 of Chapter 414 of New York\u0027s Education and Tax Laws violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes to all sections. In a 6-3 decision, the Court affirmed the District Court on maintenance grant and tuition reimbursement and reversed the District Court on income tax relief. The Court cited earlier decisions that established that under the Establishment Clause, a law must \"first, reflect a clearly secular legislative purpose, second, must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and third, must avoid excessive government entanglement with religion.\" Writing for the majority, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. acknowledged that New York\u0027s interest in creating a positive educational environment was a clearly secular purpose. Section 1, however, did not limit the use of the grants towards maintaining facilities used for secular purposes. This distinguished Section 1 from other aid programs approved by the Court in the past in \u003cem\u003eBoard of Education v. Allen\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eTilton v. Richardson\u003c/em\u003e. Since \"all or practically all\" of the schools that qualified were affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, the maintenance grants would \"subsidize and advance the religious mission of sectarian schools\" in violation of the Establishment Clause. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist concurred in this part of the judgment. The Court also struck down Section 2, as the tuition reimbursements did not \"guarantee the separation between secular and religious educational functions.\" While the Court recognized the possibility that reimbursement money would not end up in the hands of religious schools, the grants would attempt to \"enhance the opportunities of the poor to choose between public and nonpublic education,\" which would advance religion. Lastly, the Court reversed the District Court with regard to Sections 3, 4, and 5, ruling that effect of tax relief was similar to that of the tuition reimbursement and therefore unconstitutional. The Court in \u003cem\u003eWalz v. Tax Commission\u003c/em\u003e upheld New York\u0027s property tax exemptions for religious organizations. However, the tax exemption was designed to prevent government oppression of religion through taxation, not for the promotion of religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":34959,"name":"Leo Pfeffer","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/leo_pfeffer","view_count":0,"last_name":"Pfeffer","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"leo_pfeffer"},"advocate_description":"argued the cause for appellants in No. 72-694 and for appellees in Nos. 72-753, 72-791, and 72-929","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9123"},{"advocate":{"ID":29612,"name":"Jean M.

He was employed by a nonprofit organization that was absorbed into the Manpower Career and Development Agency (MCDA) of New York City\u0027s Human Resources Administration. He was ineligible for employment by the city under Section 53 of the New York Civil Service Law because he was a noncitizen. He was terminated for this reason alone. Dougall and other noncitizens who were terminated under Section 53 challenged the statute in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which held the statute unconstitutional. New York appealed the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Section 53 of the New York Civil Service Law violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In an 8-1 decision, the Court affirmed the District Court and held the statute unconstitutional. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the majority, recognized New York\u0027s \"interest in establishing its own form of government\" and having civil servants \"of undivided loyalty.\" However, Section 53\u0027s citizenship restriction was imprecise and \"swep[t] indiscriminately.\" Since it could prohibit noncitizens from jobs in a way that did not further the state interest, the distinction it made between citizens and aliens violated the Equal Protection Clause under \u003cem\u003eGraham v.

Another man, Gable McDonald, confessed to the murder, in addition to confession to third parties, and was taken into custody. One month later, McDonald denied the confession and was released from custody. At trial, Chambers tried to prove McDonald admitted to the crime several times and confessed to third parties. The district court found the evidence of the confessions was inadmissible because of the voucher rule – a common-law rule that prohibits the defense from cross-examining a witness when the prosecution failed to do so – and the fact that the statements were hearsay. Chambers’ appealed and argued that the district court violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by refusing to admit the evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIs there a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when the defendant cannot cross-examine a witness or admit the testimony of another person’s confession of the crime to a third party?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion for the 8-1 majority. The Court held that the district court denied Chambers a fair trial and violated his right to due process. The voucher rule prevented Chambers from discovering the circumstances of McDonald’s oral confession and challenging his repudiated written confession, which deprived Chambers of the right to contradict testimony offered against him. Under the Due Process Clause, defendants have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses on their own behalf. The Court also held that the hearsay statements were not untrustworthy evidence but were a crucial part of Chambers’ defense and could have led the jury to a different decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over this case because Chambers did not properly raise the issue of the violation of due process in the Mississippi courts before appealing to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38443,"name":"Peter Westen","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/peter_westen","view_count":0,"last_name":"Westen","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"peter_westen"},"advocate_description":"for petitioner, pro hac vice, by special leave of Court","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9136"},{"advocate":{"ID":42799,"name":"Timmie Hancock","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/timmie_hancock","view_count":0,"last_name":"Hancock","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"timmie_hancock"},"advocate_description":"for respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9137"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":15842,"title":"Oral Argument - November 15, 1972","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/15842"}],"citation":{"volume":"410","page":"284","year":"1973","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/14874"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15107,"name":"William O.

On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court held that Act 109 violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The case was remanded, and on remand the district court entered an order which permitted the State to reimburse nonpublic religious schools for services provided before Act 109 was declared unconstitutional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLemon and others challenged the district court\u0027s opinion, asserting that the district court erred in refusing to enjoin payment of around $24 million set aside by the State to compensate nonpublic religious schools for educational services rendered during the 1970-1971 school year.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eWas it an abuse of a court\u0027s discretion to allow payment of allocated funds to nonpublic religious schools, after such allocations were found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Announcing the Judgment of the Court, Justice Warren E. Burger affirmed the judgment of the district court. The Court held that permitting payment of allocated funds for 1970-1971 school year would not substantially undermine constitutional interest at stake. The Court also recognized that the denial of payment would have serious financial consequences on private schools which relied on the statute and the funds allocated for the 1970-1971 school year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Byron R. White concurred in the judgment. Justice William O. Douglas, joined by Justice William J. Brennan and Justice Potter Steward, dissented. The dissent held that the First Amendment was violated whether the payment from public funds to religious schools involved the prior year, the current year, or the next year.

Sanchez provided care to Moreno, who contributed to household living expenses. Moreno satisfied the income requirements for the federal food stamp program, but was denied under Section 3 of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, amended in 1971, which prohibited households with unrelated members from receiving food stamp benefits. Sanchez\u0027s food stamp benefits were also to be terminated. Moreno and other households who were denied benefits under Section 3 challenged the statute in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The District Court held that Section 3 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The United States appealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes Section 3 of the Food Stamp Act of 1964 violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. In a 7-2 decision, the Court upheld the District Court and maintained that amended Section 3 violated the Fifth Amendment in creating two types of households – one in which all members were related and one in which at least one member was unrelated. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., writing for the majority, acknowledged the interest of Congress in preventing abuse of the Food Stamp program. However, the statute did not fulfill Congress\u0027 stated purpose of preventing \"hippies\" and \"hippie communes\" from enrolling the food stamp program. Additionally, there existed other measures within the Food Stamp Act that were specifically aimed at preventing abuse of the program.

The Theatre clearly warned potential viewers of the sexual nature of the films and required that patrons be at least 21 years of age. The Georgia Supreme Court held that the films were \"hard core\" pornography unprotected by the Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the Georgia injunction against the films violate the First Amendment\u0027s guarantee of freedom of expression?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-to-4 decision, the Court held that obscene films did not acquire constitutional protection simply because they were exhibited for consenting adults only. Conduct involving consenting adults, the Court argued, was not always beyond the scope of governmental regulation. The Court found that there were \"legitimate state interests at stake in stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity,\" including the community\u0027s quality of life and public safety. The Court also noted that conclusive proof of a connection between antisocial behavior and obscene materials was not necessary to justify the Georgia law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court remanded the case to the Georgia Supreme Court with instructions to reconsider its decision in light of the obscenity standard spelled out in \u003cem\u003eMiller v.

Her employer withheld $16.20 in 1967 for Arizona state income taxes. McClanahan sought the return of her withheld income. She claimed that since she was a Navajo Indian residing on the reservation and since her income was derived completely on the reservation, she was exempt from state taxation. When her request was denied, she filed suit in Apache County Superior Court. The Superior Court dismissed her claim. The Court of Appeals of Arizona affirmed the dismissal. The Supreme Court of Arizona rejected her petition for review.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the State of Arizona have a right to tax Navajo Indians residing on the Navajo Reservation if their income is entirely from reservation sources?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In a unanimous decision, the Court reversed the decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals and held that Arizona did not have the right to tax McClanahan. In an opinion authored by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court emphasized the long-standing status of Indian reservations as exempt from state authority. While the Navajo Treaty signed between the Navajo nation and the United States did not explicitly exempt the nation from state laws, Arizona entered the Union on the explicit condition that it would lose its authority over Indian tribes and reservations within the state, including taxation powers. Consistent with its decision in \u003cem\u003eWarren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona State Tax Commission\u003c/em\u003e, the Court ruled that Arizona \"had no jurisdiction to impose\" state income tax on McLanahan.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":38916,"name":"Richard B.

The reliance on assessable property, the school districts claimed, caused severe inter-district disparities in per-pupil expenditures.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Texas\u0027 public education finance system violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u0027s Equal Protection Clause by failing to distribute funding equally among its school districts?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. The Court refused to examine the system with strict scrutiny since there is no fundamental right to education in the Constitution and since the system did not systematically discriminate against all poor people in Texas. Given the similarities between Texas\u0027 system and those in other states, it was clear to the Court that the funding scheme was not \"so irrational as to be invidiously discriminatory.\" Justice Powell argued that on the question of wealth and education, \"the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":16108,"name":"Arthur Gochman","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/arthur_gochman","view_count":0,"last_name":"Gochman","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"arthur_gochman"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellees","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9208"},{"advocate":{"ID":20273,"name":"Charles Alan Wright","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/charles_alan_wright","view_count":0,"last_name":"Wright","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"charles_alan_wright"},"advocate_description":"Argued the cause for the appellants","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/9209"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":16610,"title":"Oral Argument - October 12, 1972","unavailable":false,"href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/16610"}],"citation":{"volume":"411","page":"1","year":"1973","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/14912"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15107,"name":"William O.

Green protested his discharge by saying that the company’s hiring and firing practices were racially motivated. As part of his protest, he and other members of the Congress on Racial Equality illegally parked their cars to block the main roads to the plant during the morning shift change. On July 2, 1965, there was a lock-in, in which workers were unable to leave, though the extent of Green’s involvement in this incident was unclear. On July 25, 1965, McDonnell Douglas Corporation advertised for qualified mechanics and Green reapplied, only to be turned down due to his involvement in the protests. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen filed a petition with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and alleged that he was denied his position because of his race and civil rights activism. The Commission did not make any finding on the racial bias charge, but did conclude that Green was denied his job upon reapplication due to his involvement in civil rights protests. When the situation could not be resolved outside the courts, Green sued McDonnell Douglas Corporation. The district court dismissed the racial discrimination charge and held that the McDonnell Douglas Corporation refused to rehire Green because of his participation in illegal demonstrations rather than legitimate civil rights issues. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the holding that illegal protests were not protected activities but remanded the case to reconsider the racial discrimination charge. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) Is a complainant in an employment discrimination suit limited to those charges for which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found reasonable cause?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) If so, must the complainant present a prima facie case for racial discrimination?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo, yes. Justice Lewis F. Powell delivered the unanimous opinion. The Court held that the findings of the EEOC could not bar a suit that meets the jurisdictional requirements for suing in federal district court. The Court also held that Congress meant to prevent discriminatory hiring practices, not guarantee jobs, so that the complainant in an employment discrimination lawsuit carries the initial burden to present a prima facie case for racial discrimination. The burden then shifts to the company to prove that there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the hiring and/or firing practice. In this case, while Green presented a prima facie case, the Court held that McDonnell Douglas Corporation was not compelled to rehire him after his deliberately unlawful activities. On remand, Green must show that the corporation’s reasons regarding the unlawful activity were merely a pretext.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":43664,"name":"Veryl L.
