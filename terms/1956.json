Later, Thompson discovered the damage from his injury was much more extensive than originally thought.  Thomson sued to recover damages from his injury.  The district court upheld the release, noting that Thompson adamantly refused to consult an attorney, although he had many opportunities to do so, and freely entered into the agreement.

Griffin’s book \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;The Devil Rides Outside\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; traces the spiritual development of an unnamed American musician as he vacillates between choosing a life in a Benedictine monastery and the lustfulness of the outside world. When Alfred Butler, the Detroit district sales manager of Pocket Books, sold a copy of the book to a police officer, he was arrested and charged with violating a Michigan obscenity statute. At trial, the judge held that the book contained obscene language that could lead to the corruption of minors and that the passages in question lacked redeeming literary value. Butler was convicted and fined $100. Butler appealed and argued that the statute violated his right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court of Michigan denied Butler’s application for leave to appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDoes the Michigan obscenity statute violate free speech rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Felix Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the 9-0 majority. The Court held that the Michigan statute unduly restricted the freedom of speech because it took only a single trial judge’s determination that the material could potentially corrupt minors to prohibit its dissemination.

Two undercover informants for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) testified against Jencks, and reported that he had been seen at Communist Party events and working with Communist Party members. The evidence provided against Jencks was entirely circumstantial, and the prosecution\u0027s evidence rested largely on the testimonies and reports of the undercover informants. Jencks requested the testimony of the informants to review their credibility and admissibility in court. The trial court denied his request without stating the reasons, and Jencks was found guilty on two counts of communist activity and sentenced to five years imprisonment for each offense. Jencks appealed the lower court\u0027s decision on the grounds that the informants\u0027 reports should have been provided for review to determine their use in the trial and on the grounds that the jury was improperly instructed on the definitions of political party membership. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eCan a defendant request testimonial documents for admissibility in trial if those documents potentially contain classified information and possible disclosure of state secrets?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote the opinion for the 7-1 majority. The Court held that the government\u0027s reports should have been produced for review for their admission in court. A concern for national security must be weighed against prosecuting criminal action if the criminal action prosecution relies on documents that, if released, would threaten national security. Based on this weighing test, the documents should have been provided for review of admissibility in a new trial. Criminal action must be dismissed if the government refuses to release information as a matter of national security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harold Burton wrote a concurring opinion in which he agreed that the accused had the right to review the documents as evidence against him but argued that the disclosure of the documents should not guarantee a new trial. Rather, the documents should be reviewed and, if found to contain information that discredited the FBI informants’ testimony, then there should be a new trial. However, in this case Justice Burton agreed there should be a new trial on the grounds that the jury was improperly instructed on the requirements of membership to a political party. Justice John M. Harlan joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Tom C. Clark dissented and argued that, if information containing national secrets and issues of national security were available for the accused in criminal prosecutions, then national security would be greatly compromised. Justice Clark also wrote that the jury was properly instructed on the definition of membership to a political party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Charles E. Whittaker did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":62612,"name":"E. B.

The deed allowed for the extension of this reservation for an additional five years so long as operations were conducted profitably during the previous five years for an average of fifty days a year. If at the end of the original term or an additional extended term the operation had not carried on for fifty days a year, Leiter’s right to mine would terminate, and complete title would become vested in the United States. No mineral operations were conducted on the land in question during the original term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 1, 1949, the United States conveyed the operating rights under lease to Frank J. and Albert Lobrano, who then conveyed those rights to The California Company. The California Company drilled and completed eighty wells, producing $3,500,000 in royalties for the United States. Leiter Minerals, Inc. then filed an action in state court against Allen L. Lobrano and The California Company based on a Louisiana law allegedly making a reservation of mineral rights to the United States “imprescriptible”. The United States was not a party to the suit. Leiter Minerals claimed that it was the fee simple owner of all the oil, gas and mineral rights in or on the land acquired by the United States from Thomas Leiter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States then brought an action in district court; it sought to quiet Leiter Minerals’ title and rights and to enjoin Leiter Minerals from further asserting any claims in state court. The United States argued in part that irreparable injury in the form of lost royalties would result from any dispossession to its lessees. The district court granted the injunction, holding that the action could only be tried in federal court because the United States was not a party to the state court action.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the district court err by enjoining the prosecution of a case brought in state court against a lessee of the United States?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-1 decision written by Justice Felix Frankfurter, the Court held that the district court properly granted the injunction. Justice Frankfurter first looked to federal law, which specified that a court of the United States may not enjoin state court proceedings except 1) as expressly authorized by congress, 2) to aid its jurisdiction, or 3) to protect or effectuate its judgments. He also looked to the Court’s past interpretations of the Norris-La Guardia Act, where it determined that statutes generally divesting persons of pre-existing rights and privileges only divest the United States of those rights and privileges when there are expressed words to that effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Frankfurter then turned to the purpose behind the restriction of the federal courts’ injunction power, arguing that the interest in restricting this power was strongest when the state court litigation was between private parties. Here, in contrast, the United States was arguably attempting to prevent injury to the national interest. Justice Frankfurter also emphasized that the United States was not a party to the state court action, and that the United States’ position in its claim was essentially defensive. The Court remanded the case to the state court, directing it to interpret and apply the Louisiana statute in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Douglas dissented in part, questioning the majority’s decision to remand the case to Louisiana state court. He argued that Congress tasked the federal courts with deciding mixed questions of state and federal law.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41845,"name":"Samuel W.

Watkins agreed to describe his alleged connections with the Communist Party and to identify current members of the Party. Watkins refused to give information concerning individuals who had left the Communist Party. Watkins argued that such questions were beyond the authority of the Committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the activities of the Un-American Activities Committee constitute an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 6-to-1 decision, the Court held that the activities of the House Committee were beyond the scope of congressional power. The Court held that both the authorizing resolution of the Committee and the specific statements made by the Committee to Watkins failed to limit the Committee\u0027s power. The Court found that because Watkins had not been given sufficient information describing the pertinency of the questions to the subjects under inquiry, he had not been accorded a fair opportunity to determine whether he was within his rights in refusing to answer. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment thus invalidated Watkins\u0027 conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13305,"title":"Oral Argument - March 07, 1957 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13305"},{"id":13340,"title":"Oral Argument - March 07, 1957 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13340"}],"citation":{"volume":"354","page":"178","year":"1957","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24164"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

While passing through Dayton, Ohio, the train braked abruptly to avoid hitting a car stopped on a railroad crossing. Herdman fell and was injured as the train came to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerdman sued the railroad company for negligence and claimed that the company was responsible for his fall under the doctrine of \u003ci\u003eres ipsa loquitur\u003c/i\u003e. Courts typically apply this doctrine when negligence can be inferred, without actual direct evidence, from the very nature of the accident. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled in favor of the railroad on the basis that Herdman did not provide enough facts to support his negligence claim, even under the \u003ci\u003eres ipsa loquitur\u003c/i\u003e doctrine. Herdman appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Herdman present enough evidence to go to trial for a negligence claim under the doctrine of \u003ci\u003eres ipsa loquitur\u003c/i\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. In an 8-1 decision by Justice William J. Brennan, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s decision. To effectively present a negligence claim under \u003ci\u003eres ipsa loquitur\u003c/i\u003e Herdman should have shown that sudden stops, like the one that caused his injury, are unusual or extraordinary. Herdman failed to present any such evidence. Justice Felix Frankfurter dissented, stating that the Court should not grant certiorari just to reevaluate the facts of certain cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":31905,"name":"Joseph P.

Lambert, a convicted felon, stayed in Los Angeles for seven years without registering and was convicted of violating the ordinance. On appeal, she argued that due process under the Fourteenth Amendment required the ordinance to include some mental state element, and she was not aware of it. \u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Lambert’s conviction under the ordinance without notice violate the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause? \u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eIn a 5-4 opinion written by Justice William Douglas, the Court held that the prosecution would need to provide circumstantial evidence showing that the defendant should have been aware of the possibility that registration was required. The Court reasoned that due process requires notice unless the defendant has actual knowledge of the ordinance that has been violated. As there was no circumstantial evidence showing Lambert should have been aware of the ordinance, the Court concluded her due process rights were violated. The Court further held that because the ordinance that forced convicted felons to register was not accompanied by any action, nor were there circumstances that would lead a felon to be aware of his or her duty to register, the ordinance was unconstitutional. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter dissented, joined by Justices Harlan and Whittaker, arguing that mistake of law is usually not a defense to a crime. For example, a person may be convicted of drug possession even if he or she did not know that the particular substance was illegal. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Harold Burton also dissented in a separate opinion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":41764,"name":"Samuel C.

The agreement provided the means to amend its terms: Either party must notify the other in writing of its desire to amend the agreement, after which the company and the union should attempt to agree on the desired amendments. If no agreement was reached within sixty days, either party may terminate the agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn August 24, 1951, the union transmitted a letter to the company notifying the company of its desire to modify the agreement. Representatives of the company and the union first met on August 29, 1951 to discuss the proposed amendments. The two groups held 37 more meetings between that date and April 30, 1952, but no agreement was reached. On April 30, employees of the company went on strike, demanding wage increases and other benefits. Neither the company nor the union notified the other that it intended to terminate the contract. On June 21, 1952, the union offered to return all striking employees to work unconditionally, but the company refused this offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company distributed a letter to the union explaining that there would be no reinstatement of workers unless the employees agreed to work for a period of at least one year without work stoppage. After June 21, the company interviewed individual employees and rehired only those who assured the company that they would continue to work daily throughout the strike. On August 3, 1952, a new agreement was executed between the company and the union; employees were reinstated the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) provided that where there is a collective bargaining contract, employees may not go on strike until sixty days after either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate or modify the contract or until the contract expires, whichever occurs later. Employees who go on strike before this point lose the protection of the NLRA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the negotiations for the new agreement, the union filed a charge of unfair labor practices against the company with the National Labor Relations Board, based on the company’s response to the employees’ offer to return to work. The five member Board held in a split decision that the company was guilty of unfair labor practices under the NLRA, rejecting the company’s defense that the strikers lost the protection of the act because the contract was still in effect. The company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which set aside the Board’s ruling. The Eighth Circuit held that a strike would violate the terms of the contract until the contract expired or was cancelled in the manner provided for in the NLRA. As the contract had not expired when the employees went on strike, those employees violated the terms of the NLRA and lost its protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the case was pending in the Supreme Court, Lion Oil Company was merged into Monsanto Chemical Company. By order of the Court, Monsanto was made a party in the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003e(1) By going on strike, did Lion Oil Company\u0027s union employees engage in activity that is not protected by the National Labor Relations Act because the collective bargaining agreement was still in effect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Did the union employees breach their contract by going on strike?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo and no. In a decision written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court held that the union did not violate the terms of the National Labor Relations Act by going on strike. Chief Justice Warren rejected the Eighth Circuit’s narrower, more literal interpretation of the Act. He looked to the legislative history of the NLRA and concluded that while Congress recognized a duty to bargain over modifications when the contract itself contemplates such bargaining, it would make little sense to deprive unions’ of the threat of strike, a force depended upon to facilitate settlements with companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren investigated the relevant language of the NLRA, determining that Congress intended “expiration date” to encompass both notice of a party’s desire to terminate or modify the contract and the date when the contract would normally expire. Hence, the union was not obligated to wait to strike until the contract’s actual expiration date. This conclusion was based in part on the Court’s ruling in \u003ci\u003eMastro Plastics Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board\u003c/i\u003e. There, the Court recognized a dual purpose in the Act: to substitute collective bargaining for economic warfare and to protect the right of employees to engage in concerted activities -- like strikes -- for their own benefit. Otherwise, the Chief Justice argued, unions would be wary of entering into long-term contracts at all. Chief Justice Warren thus concluded that the notice and waiting requirements of the Act were fully satisfied, as the strike did not occur until long after the union delivered notice of proposed amendments to the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Justice Warren also rejected the company’s contention that the strike was a breach of contract, holding that where a contract does not contain an express waiver of the right to strike, that waiver cannot be inferred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Felix Frankfurter concurred in part and dissented in part, taking issue only with the majority’s breach of contract ruling. He noted that the Eighth Circuit did not reach that issue because of its decision to set aside the Board’s ruling, and that the Board did not raise the issue on appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John Harlan also concurred in part and dissented in part. He agreed with the majority’s construction of the Act, but took issue with the majority’s ruling on the unfair labor practice charge. He also noted that the issue was not taken up by the Eighth Circuit, and strongly objected to the Court ruling on issues not decided by lower courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice William Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":42933,"name":"Theophil C.

The Act forbids any person to transport black bass or other fish across state lines if doing so is prohibited by the laws of the state. In Florida, such issues are governed by the regulations of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. The district court held that the regulations were not “laws” of Florida under the meaning of the Black Bass Act and quashed the information. The United States appealed directly to the Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eAre the regulations of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission considered “laws” of the state of Florida as the word is construed in a federal act?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Justice Stanley Reed delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court. The Supreme Court held that precedent has established that rulings of state administrative agencies should be considered laws of the state. In the case of fish and game legislation, the majority of state legislatures vest regulatory authority in commissions. The Court held that the congressional intent behind the Black Bass Act was to enforce the fishing regulations of individual states regardless of whether those regulations came from commissions or state legislatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":35094,"name":"Leonard B.

The daughter and the intruder struggled through several rooms until she was able to seize his knife, and he fled. The assailant had a towel over his head, so the victim could not identify the defendant during the trial. The police apprehended William Earl Fikes on the basis of a call from a private citizen and held him “on an open charge of investigation.” The police questioned Fikes for hours, placed him in jail, and limited his access to anyone familiar. After nearly a week of this treatment, Fikes confessed in the form of answers to the interrogator’s leading questions. Five days later, Fikes confessed under questioning a second time. When these confessions were admitted into the trial as evidence, Fikes did not testify regarding the events surrounding his interrogation because the judge had ruled he would be subjected to unlimited cross-examination. The jury convicted Fikes and sentenced him to death. The Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid the questioning leading up to Fikes’ confessions and their subsequent use in trial violate his right to Due Process?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the 6-3 majority. The Court held that the circumstances surrounding Fikes’ confession were coercive and unduly influenced him. Because the confessions were gained through coercion, their use in trial constituted a denial of due process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his concurring opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote that mental and emotional coercion achieve the same result as physical coercion and should be considered equally detrimental to the interests of justice. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined in the concurrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice John M. Harlan wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the questioning that led to the confessions was not definitively coercive. He also argued that, without evidence that shows the questioning was unconstitutional, the majority opinion overstepped the Court’s bounds by reversing the decision. Justice Stanley Reed and Justice Harold Burton joined in the dissent.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":30616,"name":"Jack Greenberg","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/jack_greenberg","view_count":0,"last_name":"Greenberg","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"jack_greenberg"},"advocate_description":"for the petitioner","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21784"},{"advocate":{"ID":40567,"name":"Robert Straub","href":"https://api.oyez.org/people/robert_straub","view_count":0,"last_name":"Straub","length_of_service":0,"identifier":"robert_straub"},"advocate_description":"for the respondent","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/21785"}],"oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13236,"title":"Oral Argument - December 06, 1956 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13236"},{"id":13288,"title":"Oral Argument - December 06, 1956 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13288"}],"citation":{"volume":"352","page":"191","year":"1957","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24225"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

According to Agent Norris Durham of the FBN, after the second meeting, Detective Byson of the Chicago police climbed into the trunk of a Cadillac sedan owned and driven by \"John Doe,\" an informant for the government. The trunk was propped open slightly to preserve Byson\u0027s line of sight. John Doe drove the car to 74th Street and St. Lawrence Avenue, where Alberto Roviaro got out of a Pontiac sedan. Roviaro entered the Cadillac sedan and took a seat next to the driver, John Doe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurham followed the Cadillac, which took a circuitous rote to Champlain Avenue and 74th Street. He observed Roviaro leave the Cadillac and walk to a nearby tree, where he picked up a small package. Byson confirmed this from his vantage point in the Cadillac\u0027s trunk. Roviaro then walked to the car\u0027s open right front door and motioned as if he was leaving the package inside. A chemist working for the United States later identified the package\u0027s contents as heroin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government charged Roviaro with trafficking heroin, in violation of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act. He was convicted, and the district court denied his motion for a new trial. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, affirmed the ruling. Judge Walter Lindley, writing for a unanimous court, held that because John Doe was not a participant in Roviaro\u0027s actual possession of heroin, Roviaro is not entitled to full disclosure of his identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eIn a prosecution for trafficking heroin, may the government conceal informant John Doe\u0027s identity if he helped to set up the sale of heroin and was present during the sale?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eNo. Justice Harold Burton, writing for a majority in a 6-1 decision, held that Roviaro\u0027s interest in preparing his defense outweighed the public interest in protecting John Doe\u0027s identity. The Court focused on the fundamental requirements of fairness, reasoning that where the identity of an informant or the contents of an informant\u0027s communications are relevant and helpful to a defense, the government\u0027s privilege must give way. Justice Burton also noted that the charge in question required more than mere possession of heroin; Roviaro had the burden of justifying this possession, which underlined his need for access to material witnesses. John Doe was his only material witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustice Thomas Clark dissented. He wrote that the majority\u0027s decision jeopardizes the government\u0027s privilege in cases involving informants, especially in drug cases where informants are often necessary to the proper administration and prosecution of narcotic laws. He also suggested that Roviaro was attempting to win on a technicality --as he likely already knew the informant\u0027s identity-- rather than on the merits of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustices Hugo Black and Charles Whittaker took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13149,"title":"Oral Argument - December 11, 1956 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13149"},{"id":13274,"title":"Oral Argument - December 11, 1956 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13274"}],"citation":{"volume":"353","page":"53","year":"1957","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24231"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

Second, the Court drew a distinction between the \"advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow as an abstract principle\" and the \"advocacy and teaching of concrete action for the forcible overthrow of the Government.\" The Court recognized that instances of speech that amounted to \"advocacy of action\" were \"few and far between.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n","oral_argument_audio":[{"id":13197,"title":"Oral Argument - October 08, 1956","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13197"},{"id":13227,"title":"Oral Argument - October 09, 1956 (Part 1)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13227"},{"id":13254,"title":"Oral Argument - October 09, 1956 (Part 2)","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/13254"}],"citation":{"volume":"354","page":"298","year":"1957","href":"https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/24236"},"decisions":[{"votes":[{"member":{"ID":15097,"name":"John M.

The majority noted that the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance or form of expression, such as materials that were \"utterly without redeeming social importance.\" The Court held that the test to determine obscenity was \"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\" The Court held that such a definition of obscenity gave sufficient fair warning and satisfied the demands of Due Process.

A day later, Trop willingly surrendered to an army truck headed back to Casablanca. Despite testifying that he \"decided to return to the stockade\" when he was picked up, a general court martial convicted Trop of desertion and sentenced him to three years at hard labor, loss of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. In 1952, Trop applied for a passport. His application was rejected under Section 401(g) of the amended 1940 Nationality Act, on the ground that he lost his citizenship due to his conviction and dishonorable discharge for wartime desertion. After failing to obtain a declaratory judgment that he was a US citizen, from both a district and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Trop appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.\u003c/p\u003e\n","question":"\u003cp\u003eDid Section 401(g) of the amended 1940 Nationality Act (the \"Act\") allow for an unconstitutional punishment by authorizing the expatriation of a citizen convicted of wartime desertion?\u003c/p\u003e\n","conclusion":"\u003cp\u003eYes. After finding that Section 401(g) of the amended Act was penal in nature, since it punished convicted deserters with denationalization, the Court held that expatriation was barred by the Eighth Amendment as a cruel and unusual penal remedy. Citizenship, the Court stated, is not a license that expires upon misbehavior. Rather, it can only be voluntarily renounced by express language and, or, conduct. Since Trop did not involve himself in any way with a foreign state, so as to demonstrate disloyalty to the United States, his court martial conviction of desertion did not justify his expatriation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","advocates":[{"advocate":{"ID":37445,"name":"Osmond K.
